The governing principle for heat transfer in a reversible process is the Second Law, which states $\\delta q_{\\text{rev}} = T ds$.\n2.  **Analyze Process 1-2 (Constant Volume, Reversible):** In this process, the heat transfer per unit mass ($q_{1-2}$) is given by the integral: $$q_{1-2} = \\int_{1}^{2} T ds$$ On the $T-s$ diagram, this represents the **area under the curve** of the constant volume line between State 1 and State 2.\n3.  **Analyze Process 2-3 (Isentropic, Reversible):** Since this is **reversible and adiabatic**, the process is **isentropic** ($s_3 = s_2$). The heat transfer is zero ($q_{2-3} = 0$). On the $T-s$ diagram, this is a **vertical line**.\n4.  **Determine Total Heat:** The total heat transfer is the sum of the heat transfers for the individual steps: $$q_{1-3} = q_{1-2} + q_{2-3} = q_{1-2}$$.\n5.  **Calculate $q_{1-2}$:** For a constant volume process of a pure substance like water, the change in internal energy equals the heat transfer ($du = \\delta q_{\\text{rev}} - P dv \\implies du = \\delta q_{\\text{rev}}$ when $dv=0$).
