The system consists of the iron block ($\mathbf{CV1}$) and the water ($\mathbf{CV2}$).\n\n### \u26a1\ufe0f Conceptual Strategy\n1.  **Define the System and Process:** The system is the **iron block plus the water bath** (a combined $\\mathbf{Closed System}$). Since the system is insulated (implied, no mention of heat loss to surroundings) and no work is done, the **total energy of the system is conserved** ($\Delta E_{\\text{total}} = 0$).\n2.  **Apply the First Law:** The energy change is due only to the change in **Internal Energy ($\Delta U$)** of the components ($\Delta U_{\\text{Fe}} + \Delta U_{\\text{H2O}} = 0$).\n3.  **Relate $\\Delta U$ to Temperature:** For incompressible solids and liquids (like iron and water), the change in internal energy is given by $\Delta U = m c_v \Delta T$. Since $c_p \\approx c_v$ for these substances, use $\Delta U \\approx m c_p \Delta T$.\n4.  **Solve for Final Temperature ($T_2$):** Set up the equation: $m_{\\text{Fe}} c_{\\text{Fe}} (T_2 - T_{1,\\text{Fe}}) + m_{\\text{H2O}} c_{\\text{H2O}} (T_2 - T_{1,\\text{H2O}}) = 0$.
