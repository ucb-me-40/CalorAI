{"prompt": "--- Level 3: Full Solved Example ---\n\nGoal: A piston compresses a gas inside of it. Consider three different processes: isothermal, isobaric, and adiabatic. Create a plot of pressure vs. volume for these three different compression processes.", "completion": "The goal is to visually represent three ideal gas compression processes on a $P$-$V$ diagram, assuming a common initial state ($A$) and a common final volume ($V_B$) for comparison.\n\n### \u2795 Step 1: Define the Governing Equations\n\nAssuming the gas is an Ideal Gas, the relationship for each process is:\n\n| Process | Equation | Explanation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Isobaric** | $$P = P_A$$ | Pressure is constant throughout the process. |\n| **Isothermal** | $$P V = P_A V_A \\implies P = \\frac{P_A V_A}{V}$$ | Temperature is constant; $P$ is inversely proportional to $V$. |\n| **Adiabatic** | $$P V^\\kappa = P_A V_A^\\kappa \\implies P = P_A \\left(\\frac{V_A}{V}\\right)^\\kappa$$ | $P V^\\kappa$ is constant, where $\\kappa = c_p/c_v$ (typically $1.4$ for air). |\n\n### \u2795 Step 2: Plotting and Final Result\n\nWhen plotting from an initial state $A$ to a smaller final volume $V_B$ (compression), the three processes diverge due to their different mathematical exponents. Since $\\kappa$ (the adiabatic exponent) is always greater than $1$ (the isothermal exponent), the **adiabatic curve is the steepest**.\n\n**Visual Representation on P-V Diagram:**\n\n1.  The **Isobaric curve** is a horizontal line at $P_A$ (if $P_A$ is the final pressure, it would be a flat line; in compression to a fixed volume, it's trivial/unlikely). The **most common comparison** uses the curve where the process is defined, resulting in a horizontal line for the Isobaric process shown for reference. The final pressure is simply $P_A$.\n2.  The **Isothermal curve** ($PV = \\text{const}$) drops less steeply than the adiabatic curve for expansion and rises less steeply for compression.\n3.  The **Adiabatic curve** ($PV^\\kappa = \\text{const}$) drops more steeply than the isothermal curve during expansion and rises **most steeply** during compression. This is because all the compression work goes into increasing the gas's internal energy (raising $T$) instead of being removed as heat ($Q=0$).\n\n**Order of Final Pressure ($P_B$):**\n\n$$P_{\\text{Adiabatic}} > P_{\\text{Isothermal}} > P_{\\text{Isobaric}}$$ \n\n**Order of Work Input ($W_{\\text{in}}$):** Since work is the area under the curve ($\int P \\text{d}V$): \n\n$$W_{\\text{Adiabatic}} > W_{\\text{Isothermal}} > W_{\\text{Isobaric}}$$"}
