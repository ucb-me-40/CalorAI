    "Cold water ($c_p$ = 4.18 kJ/kg.Â°C) leading to a shower enters a well-insulated, thin-walled, double-pipe, counterflow heat exchanger at 10Â°C at a rate of 0.95 kg/s and is heated to 70Â°C by hot water ($c_p$ = 4.19 kJ/kg.Â°C) that enters at 85Â°C at a rate of 1.6 kg/s. \n",

We will say that the cold water enters the heat exchanger at state 1 and exits at state 2. We will say that the hot water enters the heat exchanger at state 3 and exits at state 4. \n",
