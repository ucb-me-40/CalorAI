  "problem_statement_raw": "A piston cylinder contains nitrogen initially at 400 kPa, 27$^\\circ$C, and 0.5 m$^3$. The piston contains a resistor. The pressure in the piston is kept constant while 120 V is applied to the resistor resulting in 2 A flowing thorugh it for 5 min. The piston is also cooled, transferring 2800 J out. Goal: Determine the final temperature, $T_2$. Draw a schematic of a piston cylinder. Show that electrical work is transferred into the piston and heat is transferred out of it. The fluid in the piston cylinder is nitrogen.",
  "physical_laws_and_assumptions": "Ideal gas, undergoes quasi-equilibrium expansion or compression Use `pyCalor` to determine nitrogens properties. In an alternative solution we can treat nitrogen as an ideal gas. Neglect kinetic and potential energy Boundary work is transferred through expansion ($p dV$).
