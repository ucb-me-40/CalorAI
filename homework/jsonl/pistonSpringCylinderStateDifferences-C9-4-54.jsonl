{"prompt": "I am working on the piston-spring problem (pistonSpringCylinderStateDifferences-C9-4-54.json). I know it's a closed system with a spring, but the final questions ask only for $\\Delta U$ and $\\Delta H$. What is the simplest, core strategy for finding these changes for an ideal gas?", "completion": "--- Level 1: Conceptual Strategy / Study Guide ---\n\nThis problem simplifies significantly because the fluid is treated as an **Ideal Gas with Constant Specific Heats**. For an ideal gas, the specific internal energy ($u$) and specific enthalpy ($h$) are functions of **temperature only** ($u = u(T)$, $h = h(T)$).\n\n**Conceptual Strategy:**\n1.  **Ignore the Process Path:** The complex process path caused by the spring and the piston-cylinder device only affects the boundary **work** ($W$) and **heat transfer** ($Q$). Since $\\Delta U$ and $\\Delta H$ are **state functions** for an ideal gas, they depend only on the initial ($T_1$) and final ($T_2$) temperatures, not the path.\n2.  **Use Ideal Gas Property Relations:** Apply the fundamental ideal gas relations that link temperature change to the change in internal energy and enthalpy using the constant specific heats ($c_v$ and $c_p$).\n3.  **Calculate Total Change:** Multiply the specific property changes ($\\Delta u, \\Delta h$) by the total mass ($m$) to get the total changes ($\\Delta U, \\Delta H$) for the closed system.\n\n**Study Guide:**\n* **Read:** Review **Chapter 3: Properties of Pure Substances**, focusing on **The Ideal-Gas Equation of State** and **Specific Heats of Ideal Gases** (Table A-2).\n* **Review:** The core property relations $\\mathbf{\\Delta u = c_v \\Delta T}$ and $\\mathbf{\\Delta h = c_p \\Delta T}$ are the foundation of this calculation."}
