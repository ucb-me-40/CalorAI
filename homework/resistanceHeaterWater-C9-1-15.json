    "problem_statement_raw": "A resistance heater with a power rating of $\\dot{W}=H$\\ kW operates for $t$\\ hours to heat water to the desired temperature. Determine the total electric energy consumed in kJ. Then, express the same energy in kWh.",
    "schematic_description": "The problem involves a simple electrical resistance water heater connected to a power supply. The heater has a specified power rating $H$ (in kW) and operates for a certain time duration $t$ (in hours). No diagram is provided, but conceptually the schematic consists of an electrical power input into the heater and a single control volume (the water), with energy transfer by electricity only. There are no moving boundaries, no shafts, and no mass flow shown.",

    "pedagogical_summary": "This problem reinforces the basic relationship between power, time, and energy. The key idea is to apply unit conversions carefully: kW to W and hours to seconds. The conversion between kJ and kWh is also straightforward once one remembers that \\(1~\\mathrm{kWh} = 3600~\\mathrm{kJ}\\). Common mistakes include mixing up kW and kWh, or failing to convert hours to seconds when calculating in joules. Because this is a direct electrical energy calculation, no thermodynamic property evaluation is neededâ€”making it an excellent introductory exercise."
