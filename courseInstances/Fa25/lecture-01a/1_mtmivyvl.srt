1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
I've got you ten, so
let's get started.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,560
Welcome to ME 40.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,760
If you're not in this
class, you can leave.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,240
If you're not in
the class, you're

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,520
welcome to learn today
about thermodynamics.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,120
Of course theme. So what

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,000
do we talk about
in thermo?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,439
Energy, right? So
timely ones today,

9
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:19,919
we talk about the
conversion of it.

10
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,999
So you think about
photovoltaics, right?

11
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:26,159
This is, like, the most
fastly growing area

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,879
of energy systems.

13
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,519
Um, we think about
systems that are

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,080
consuming lots of
energy at the moment.

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,360
Think about data centers,

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,559
right, large language
models, right?

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,879
The third part of it is

18
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,279
because this is
intermittent,

19
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:39,160
we think a lot about
how we store energy.

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,639
So because of the fact
that we receive it,

21
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:42,879
we need to store
this and figure

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,479
out how to use this.

23
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,959
So this is basically
the theme of

24
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:48,479
our course, our team.

25
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,770
So, um, Cassie McCormick
is the head GSI.

26
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,090
I'm joined also by GSI

27
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,210
Jessica Woo here
and our reader,

28
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,089
Dear Baldwa, very
capable team.

29
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:00,889
These two are a member
of my research group,

30
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:02,609
and I've already
worked with Dear as

31
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,329
a reader last semester
for Emy winning 46,

32
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,010
so energy conversion
principles.

33
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,369
The point is, I think
you're in good hands.

34
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,689
You have a
motivated group,

35
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,769
a little about myself.

36
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,490
So I've been
teaching thermo

37
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,729
for the better
part of 11 years.

38
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,489
So I was overseas
for about ten years.

39
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:17,729
I taught at Ate Ha.

40
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,409
It's where Einstein
was a student,

41
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,969
a famously very
bad student.

42
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,289
So if you want to learn
anything about him,

43
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:23,449
you don't go
to Zurich, you

44
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:24,929
have to go to the
Capitol Bern.

45
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,009
You read a
little bit about

46
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,249
him and his stories,

47
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:29,039
there's two things
that are great.

48
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,869
Um, was about his

49
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,309
friendships, series
of friendships.

50
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,309
The first is he had
a friend who kind of

51
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:34,829
helped him get through

52
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,429
his courses because he
was bored to death.

53
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,790
They were teaching
the old physics.

54
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,989
He wanted to learn
about the newest kind

55
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:40,749
of friend gave him

56
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:41,949
notes and helped
him around.

57
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,109
Maybe helpful for
some of you here.

58
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,829
And the second thing
is that friend also

59
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:47,869
got him his first job
out of school, right?

60
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,749
So he got him a job
at the patent office.

61
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:50,829
And for those
who don't know,

62
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:51,909
that's where we
went to write on

63
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,349
basically his most
famous famous works

64
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,629
were there is his,

65
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,089
uh, apartments there,

66
00:01:58,089 --> 00:01:59,610
but a coffee
shop in Burns,

67
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,849
you ever find yourself
there, it's very

68
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,209
beautiful walking
you kind of see.

69
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,049
And then when
you look from

70
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,889
that apartment
and you walk,

71
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:06,769
you can see what's
called a Glockenspiel,

72
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:07,729
basically a big clock.

73
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,049
And so you can get
this idea of walking

74
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:10,329
towards and away
from the clock

75
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:11,730
and maybe some
insight into what

76
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,409
he was thinking
about in a daily.

77
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,169
So not our tower,

78
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,810
but a big kind
of like a tower,

79
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,290
but a much bigger
clock on it.

80
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,209
See you Jess.

81
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,929
Learning objectives
for the course, right?

82
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:22,450
So we're going to talk
a lot about laws,

83
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,370
primarily the first
and second law there.

84
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,890
You're going to be able
to say this. So you

85
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,089
go to a party, talk
to some friends.

86
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:28,330
You say, this is
the first and

87
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,090
the second law. This is
how I think about it.

88
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,370
You're going to do some

89
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,130
simple single
answer problems.

90
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,290
I with first law,

91
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,290
first and second law,

92
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,170
and then we get into this.

93
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,889
So a lot of this is
sort of foundational.

94
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:39,449
Hopefully,

95
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:40,770
you stay with me
because after that,

96
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,009
you'll see the
utility of it.

97
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,449
You need much
bigger systems

98
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,490
and like the ones I
was talking about,

99
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,689
you know, before,
perpetual mobile.

100
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:51,170
So basically cycles
that violate, you know,

101
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,130
first and second law, and

102
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,170
then really get into
thermodynamic data.

103
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,610
So in this class, you

104
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,520
might have heard
about like tables.

105
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,670
I think you should
love fans there.

106
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,269
Okay, so that missed.

107
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,869
But the point is that

108
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,670
old school was that
you had a book.

109
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,310
Mostly why people
hate this kind

110
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,830
of class is that they
had to sit there,

111
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,590
look at this end of

112
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,430
the book appendix and
figure out things.

113
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,110
Here, we use Python,

114
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,270
right? We use module.

115
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,750
So I encourage
you from today,

116
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,949
if you don't feel
comfortable in Python,

117
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,270
which you should
because it's

118
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,870
a prerect to
this, learn this.

119
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,750
So we have homework
problems and stuff.

120
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,669
It's not
sophisticated Python.

121
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:26,789
I was raised on Fortran.

122
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,514
Does anyone know
Fortran is?

123
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:30,000
One, two. Okay, so

124
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,639
my hardcore
ones out there.

125
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,880
So everything
runs on Portrait.

126
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,360
You just don't know
it. But, you know,

127
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,240
I also taught myself
Python, right?

128
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,759
So if I can do it with
no class, surely,

129
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,559
you all are capable.
Our homework.

130
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,520
So some house scheme,
our homework's done

131
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,840
through a website
called Prairie Learn.

132
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,199
This is a fantastic
homework suite.

133
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,320
It's also how
we'll run all

134
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,559
of our assessments.

135
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:56,400
So the way that
you practice

136
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
on your homework
is going to be

137
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
exactly how you did
practice for assessments.

138
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,639
So if you haven't
already go and

139
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,840
enroll at this website,
look for ME 40.

140
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,460
I The way to see
the course in terms

141
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,780
of organization is

142
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,020
that we have
three modules.

143
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,420
First law, second law,

144
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,060
applications. That's it.

145
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,379
Okay? If this is like
the Tour de France,

146
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,900
these are flat stages.

147
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,060
You think, okay, I

148
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,419
did good in this.
I feel good.

149
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:21,659
This is the Pyrenees.

150
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:23,939
This is the Alps. This
is like pain, right?

151
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,379
This is, I'm not
going to lie to you.

152
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,339
This is like, you
know, this hurts.

153
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,939
If you can survive
that part of it,

154
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,339
from this point
on, everything is

155
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,939
basically very
straightforward, okay,

156
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,899
with the exception of

157
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,380
maybe chemical reactions

158
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,420
for mechanical
engineers myself,

159
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,699
chemistry I'm deeply
uncomfortable with.

160
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,019
But yeah, basically,
up until that point,

161
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,580
it's pretty
straight forward.

162
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,699
So it's kind of like
flat, a big mountain,

163
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,179
and maybe not
exactly downhill,

164
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:50,649
but maybe a bit
flatter there.

165
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,169
In the B courses, right?

166
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,089
So within each module,
we have pages.

167
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,729
On those pages, right,

168
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,489
we have to do
before lecture,

169
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,129
to do by the end
of the module,

170
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,249
and to read for that week.

171
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,449
And I can't emphasize
enough staying with

172
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:03,650
that analogy of the Tour

173
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,930
de France and cycling.

174
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,889
This is a class that is

175
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,089
very easy to
get behind on.

176
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,729
It's easy to
stay on track.

177
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,329
You just be disciplined,

178
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,649
you read, you do what

179
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:13,170
I tell you, you'll
be on track.

180
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,369
But if you don't, you
will fall behind,

181
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:16,889
and it is very difficult

182
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,209
to catch back up, okay?

183
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,969
So the main thing is,
like, for this week,

184
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,589
I want you to read
Chapter one. Read it.

185
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,309
Today, you go and
you read, and,

186
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:25,349
you know, you
basically get

187
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:26,669
ahead and it's do it.

188
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:27,829
The homework in each of

189
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,549
the modules is
released now.

190
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:31,309
So the first five
homework are there.

191
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,709
I encourage you to, like,

192
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,149
get through
that, especially

193
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,469
homeworks one,
two, and three.

194
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,030
Learn the Python

195
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,469
module for determining
properties.

196
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:39,469
Get comfortable with this.

197
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:40,389
It will serve you very

198
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:41,310
well when it comes time

199
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,470
to homeworks
four and five,

200
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,109
and especially
Quiz one, okay?

201
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,769
Okay.

202
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,089
Um, I record, so
I like openness,

203
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:50,849
so I already have

204
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,489
all the videos from
last year there.

205
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,289
I'll record all of
these and post them.

206
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,650
If we ever do discussions,

207
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,809
I don't record
discussions.

208
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,129
I think recording
and a discussion

209
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,569
tends to kind of
stifle it a bit.

210
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,449
So in my opinion,

211
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,009
don't I don't
record that, okay?

212
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,929
So if you want discussion,
be here, okay?

213
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,369
If you don't want to be

214
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:08,649
here, you're an adult.

215
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:09,809
You spent your money,

216
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:11,049
spent your parents money,

217
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:12,569
whatever, like, you want

218
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,049
to come or not, that's
up to you, okay?

219
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:16,049
You're an adult
and decide that.

220
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:17,809
What I will tell
you is sometimes

221
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:20,049
the visual audio
doesn't work, okay?

222
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,330
That camera, for example,

223
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,769
is turned like 40 degrees

224
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,049
too far to the left.

225
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:25,369
So today, I have

226
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:26,529
to keep the board
exactly here.

227
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,130
Sometimes the
batteries were not and

228
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,089
I'm replacing batteries.
It's not personal.

229
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,889
I'm not trying to,
like, you know,

230
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,289
create, you know,

231
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:34,889
some withholding
system like that.

232
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,370
Sometimes things
just don't work,

233
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,610
and I'm sorry for that.

234
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,329
And so I can't
upload them.

235
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:41,970
Okay, are there
any questions

236
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,169
about that before
I dive in?

237
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,599
One Mississippi to
Mississippi. Okay.

238
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,000
Cool. So, challenges
in decarbonizing.

239
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,279
So this article posted.

240
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,559
This is from
two years ago.

241
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,879
New York Times went

242
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,319
through and was
looking into sort of

243
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,759
the solution at
that time and

244
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,440
how we were dealing
with emissions.

245
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,439
And the way that you could

246
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,479
describe that is roughly,

247
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,839
we're just going
to plug it all in.

248
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,559
We're basically just
going to plug in

249
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,039
almost, you know,
everything.

250
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,479
So at that time,
that's now

251
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,099
four years ago, You know,

252
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:12,940
you typically

253
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,699
would distribute
things by sector.

254
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:16,979
So transportation is by

255
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,380
far the largest of it.

256
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,380
Industry, the
second, residential,

257
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,179
and then commercial.

258
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:22,859
If you look into

259
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,140
the transportation
part of it,

260
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,459
a lot of it's just
passengers, right?

261
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:26,419
In the United States,

262
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,819
who drive
everywhere, right?

263
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,380
I grew up in the Midwest.

264
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,739
It's not uncommon to do

265
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,100
5 hours just use why not?

266
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,839
You can just do that,
uh um, you know, there,

267
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,919
but also into
heavy duty trucks,

268
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,439
trains, right?

269
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,800
We have basically the best

270
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,519
freight rail in the world,

271
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,839
you know, here
for that, right?

272
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,239
You have other ones
that, if you look into

273
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,919
the industry,
chemicals, right?

274
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,120
These are things
that require high

275
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,000
process temperature,
process heat.

276
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,919
So things that are in
the news a lot now are

277
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,359
rare minerals, right?
Metals, right?

278
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,879
Copper is at the
highest price that

279
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,199
it's ever been in
history, right?

280
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,319
All of these
things require

281
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,759
refining and a
lot of energy,

282
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,389
a lot of a lot of um,
heat, steel, right?

283
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,989
These require a
lot of energy into

284
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:08,070
it to do it.

285
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,429
On the residential side,

286
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:10,710
the dominating thing is

287
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,789
space heat space
heating, right?

288
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,189
Berkeley in California
in general,

289
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,870
we're kind of blessed
with a lot of warmth,

290
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,629
but a good chunk
of the US and

291
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,109
the world is
not with that.

292
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:22,949
And so, you know,

293
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,830
big consumption
in natural gas,

294
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,039
um, They're also
into cooking.

295
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,319
And then the
commercial side,

296
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,599
it's kind of a
mix there largely

297
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,839
reflects what you
would see probably

298
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,839
on the residential side.

299
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,320
Some nomenclature
into this.

300
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,880
If you look at

301
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,040
the literature
and you read and

302
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,840
especially about energy
in a large scales,

303
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,479
you'll see things
like quad.

304
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,880
So a quad is 1

305
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,199
quadrillion British
thermal units.

306
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:46,199
I'm not going to tell
you what a BTU is.

307
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:47,680
I'm against it, but

308
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,000
it exists. You
can look it up.

309
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,600
The point is
that one BTU is

310
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,960
1055 joules there, right?

311
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,595
The joules and
Newton meter, okay?

312
00:08:57,595 --> 00:08:59,590
So, how much of
that currently of

313
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,549
that makeup came from
electricity then,

314
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,149
right in transportation
in 2021,

315
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,229
very little was
electric in spite of

316
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,310
what you see and
you read, right?

317
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,630
A lot of it was still
a couple of years ago

318
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,829
just with gasoline.

319
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,509
On the chemical side, as

320
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:17,670
I mentioned, you
know, in the US,

321
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,270
you look also to

322
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,590
countries like
Germany and that,

323
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,509
where they have big
process industries.

324
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,510
A lot of that
is natural gas

325
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,590
and heating and
coal with it.

326
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,910
In space heating, right,

327
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,830
it's a larger size
of it is electric,

328
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,270
and that has to
do with the fact,

329
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,150
and what we'll go
over into this course

330
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,950
for what's called
heat pumps, right?

331
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,030
So the heat pump,

332
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,690
the beautiful thing
about a heat pump,

333
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,869
is that if I put in one
unit of electricity,

334
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:42,550
I can move three units
of heat with it, okay?

335
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,910
So that just makes
economic sense, right?

336
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,829
Like, by definition,

337
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,069
that's a very
efficient way to do

338
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:49,430
it versus a classical way

339
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,350
that I put one unit of,

340
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,189
let's say chemical
energy and I burn it,

341
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,590
I get one unit of
heat out of that.

342
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,109
You know, that's a
losing game for it.

343
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,309
So that's why
something like that

344
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:58,629
looks like it's
already developed.

345
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,790
Also because, again,

346
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,109
if I go back
to my Midwest,

347
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:04,945
a lot of buildings there

348
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:06,780
for historical reasons,

349
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,379
already have central
air conditioning.

350
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,179
So they already have

351
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,220
air conditioning systems.

352
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,140
A heat pump is nothing

353
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,180
but an air
conditioning system

354
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,420
run in reverse, okay?

355
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,260
So think about an air
conditioner, right?

356
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,100
I take heat in

357
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,540
the building and I
pump it out, right?

358
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,019
A heat pump is they
take heat from

359
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,700
the outside and I
pump it in there.

360
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,540
So infrastructure, and
we already have a lot

361
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,860
of solutions for
how to do that.

362
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,380
Okay? If you look at
20:50, and again,

363
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,660
this was a couple
of years ago in

364
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,340
the projections with it,

365
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,580
things were always getting

366
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,260
constantly more and
more efficient.

367
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,500
So you would
expect that the

368
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,180
overall consumption to

369
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,079
decrease And if you

370
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,160
look at the
different sectors,

371
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,360
things like space
heating, further adoption

372
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
into heat pumps,

373
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,080
better insulation in

374
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,480
buildings gets you there.

375
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,119
You think about
transportation,

376
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,159
passenger vehicles,
you know,

377
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,320
Teslas, right,
General Motors

378
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
doing a lot of
what they do

379
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,279
into their Chevy bolts.

380
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,880
The equinox, you'll
see around here, like,

381
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,399
a lot of those
vehicles are already

382
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,679
right electrified, so
that's straightforward.

383
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,320
But then you'll see
other things, right?

384
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,319
Notable one here
is aviation.

385
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,880
Does anyone know why we

386
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,159
are not going
to be able to

387
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,360
electrify like a
Boeing or an airbus?

388
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,679
The battery is
what? Heavy.

389
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,239
They're too heavy.

390
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:20,239
Fuel is also
kind of heavy.

391
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
Name and answer.

392
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,159
Kai.

393
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,300
Yes. Darn.

394
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,459
That's a specific
technical proposal,

395
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:41,220
maybe something you would

396
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
do right in deep space,

397
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,900
but wasn't working.
Other ideas?

398
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,540
I need a name
and then loud.

399
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,900
I need the
intensity higher.

400
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,220
The density of
energy dens of.

401
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,700
I think it's coming
to it. One more.

402
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,770
Battery charges.

403
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,010
Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,410
So charge times.

405
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,130
So if you think

406
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,729
about a cell phone
in charging,

407
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:14,890
how many years
can you go on

408
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,009
a cell phone before you

409
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:18,169
have to replace
your battery?

410
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,930
Five. That's
amazing. Okay.

411
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,130
So I'm probably at like
two into it, right?

412
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,730
So it's about 1,000
cycles, right?

413
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,330
You can basically do

414
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,729
about 1,000 cycles lithium

415
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:32,010
ion roughly there
before it's gone.

416
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,210
If you took planes and
you wanted to do that,

417
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,410
first of all, they'd be

418
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,610
massive batteries, right?

419
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,410
You can install
one and two,

420
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,450
you'd have to throw them

421
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,410
out every six months.

422
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,490
Like, gone, right?

423
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,850
So that's a very right?

424
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,689
So basically, that is

425
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,129
not there's other
ones that'll work.

426
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,610
You go to Alaska,
you want to go

427
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,250
into Cessna,
electrify that there.

428
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,810
Like there's
cases, but it's

429
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,450
not going to flying here,

430
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,290
Europe, here,

431
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,050
Australia, you know,
Asia and stuff.

432
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,850
Like, that's just
not current and

433
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,329
future looking at trends

434
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,085
with this, that's
not going to cut it.

435
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,440
And so the thing
is, like, how

436
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,599
does one do that?

437
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,880
Where I was before, people

438
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,279
who looked at
this seriously

439
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,239
were constructing
massive solar fields.

440
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,560
Like, in my old
building, we had

441
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,320
a big I mean,

442
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,839
it looked like an
old satellite dish.

443
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,560
The big ones, they
are a big old dish,

444
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,600
concentrated all the
sunlight into an area.

445
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,919
You fed it water, you fed

446
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,439
it CO two and
into a catalyst,

447
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:24,800
and you produce
methane out of it,

448
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
and basically they
produce fuel.

449
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,520
So like Swiss, that's

450
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,519
a big airlines
Switzerland,

451
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,680
and they're basically
we're buying from

452
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,840
a company Sin Helion and

453
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,679
stuff that we're looking

454
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,959
into this as a technology.

455
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,400
But pretty much, it's
like liquid fuel,

456
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,320
and you got to
figure out, like,

457
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,480
how you're going
to do that in

458
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,599
a sustainable way
because electrons,

459
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:44,800
you know, for that
reason and the

460
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,959
heavy reason and
the fact that

461
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,039
the batteries don't last

462
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,000
is not going to cut it.

463
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,439
The long haul trucking,

464
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,800
heavy duty stuff,
that's also

465
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,320
an area that's quite
difficult, right?

466
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
So that's just
an area where,

467
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
again, for the
same reason,

468
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,480
with batteries, you know,

469
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,680
semi trucks here drive

470
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,920
1 million miles, right?

471
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,879
Like, that's just,
like, not hard for

472
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,880
them to do several million
miles and with it.

473
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,080
And so for the
same reason there,

474
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,040
you have to think
about, like,

475
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,559
what's going to be a
potential replacement,

476
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,679
you know, there
into petroleum.

477
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,920
And on the
industrial side,

478
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,080
sort of the same
thing, like, how do

479
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,319
you get to these
high temperatures?

480
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,959
There's some
fantastic startups

481
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,080
in the area that look,

482
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,720
for example, and
Torres is one of them.

483
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,550
They take, um, Yeah.

484
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,829
I'm also not a
rich person.

485
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:23,710
I have no boards or

486
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,750
connection to any
of these companies.

487
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,470
So, like, basically, they

488
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,310
take photons, right?

489
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,510
So they take,
like, sunlight,

490
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,030
they produce electricity,
and what they

491
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,669
do is they just
heat up graphite.

492
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,550
They just heat up, like,

493
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,670
blocks of, you know,

494
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,240
I mean, almost
like coal, right?

495
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,800
They heat that
up really hot,

496
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,120
and those things can store

497
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,199
a lot of themal energy,

498
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,640
and then they basically
then circulate a

499
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,559
or fluid over that and
then use that there.

500
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,880
So that's kind
of like thermal

501
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,400
batteries and what's
done with it.

502
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,519
So the chemicals,
the aviation,

503
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,479
you know, in general,

504
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,400
like, shipping and stuff,

505
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,999
these are like three of
the most difficult to

506
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:57,839
decarbonize areas.

507
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah. Okay. I could
go on and on with it.

508
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,919
So that's one
factor, right?

509
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,720
And that's like looking

510
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,640
for a couple of years.

511
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,960
One thing that was, like,

512
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,840
unanticipated, right,

513
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,480
from a couple of years ago

514
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,880
and looking into it had

515
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,200
everything to do with

516
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
demand for compute, right?

517
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So what I'm showing
you on this plot is

518
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,670
essentially a measure
of calculations, right?

519
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,830
Let's say
calculations that are

520
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,910
done by a computer
against year, right?

521
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,710
And this dashed line is

522
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,509
like frontier
compute models.

523
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:32,270
So, you know, chat,
Gemini, right?

524
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,750
So it's

525
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,350
sort of the most common
ones that are there.

526
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,350
The third thing
that's done is

527
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,960
showing The number of

528
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,119
graphical processing
units, GPUs,

529
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,719
these are basically
special kind

530
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,840
of processors that
are good for, like,

531
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,000
linear algebra and
machine learning

532
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,080
and the amount of power
that they draw, okay?

533
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,480
So like one GPU draws
about 700 watts, okay?

534
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,680
So what's a hairdryer?

535
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,920
Anyone know what
a hairdryer is?

536
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,120
I used to have really
long hair. I know this.

537
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,239
So it's about 1,000 watts.

538
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,640
So you can draw
the w about 1,200

539
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,520
watts from the wall there.

540
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,440
So, one GPU is basically

541
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,720
like a hairdryer
that's there.

542
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,520
So these models a
couple of years ago,

543
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,000
you had 10,000 of
those, all right?

544
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,040
Present day, those ones

545
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,839
now have 300,000 to them.

546
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,919
You look at like Elon,

547
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,119
what they have
in Tennessee,

548
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:20,519
Colossus, that's
about 100,000 GPUs.

549
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,679
They're looking at
a couple hundred

550
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,839
thousand and 1 million

551
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,280
in the near future.

552
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,559
So 25000-500 megawatts.

553
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,919
You look to like 2030.

554
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,800
So let's say we
follow this frontier

555
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,080
compute growth
trend there,

556
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,959
you're going to be

557
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,570
having a single
data center

558
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,330
that's drawing 10
gigawatts, okay?

559
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,130
So you don't have to
know what a gigawatt is.

560
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,210
I can tell you it's
as a very big number.

561
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,690
Okay. The second plot that

562
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,390
I'll show you is annual.

563
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,690
US Data Center energy use

564
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,050
in terawatt hours, okay?

565
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,130
So terawatt is

566
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,090
a big also a big a
pretty big number.

567
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,650
Basically, we use
about 14 globally,

568
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,010
something around like
ten to 20 terawatts.

569
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,969
It's pretty much what the

570
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:09,689
global capacity
for energy use.

571
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:11,449
And that's against
years, all right?

572
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,769
And so for a
number of years,

573
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:13,929
though, right,
things were very,

574
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,410
very flat, an inflection

575
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,930
point at about 20:20.

576
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,689
And again, you
know, various

577
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:20,849
sort of
projections, right?

578
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,010
This purple region is

579
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,569
sort of that mid level
of data centers.

580
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,530
Here is like the
ten gigawatt,

581
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,569
you know, level, okay?

582
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,529
This dot here, just to

583
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:30,410
give you reference as

584
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,410
to what this would mean,

585
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,770
was in 2021,

586
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,090
California's total
electricity generation.

587
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,849
So in a couple of years,

588
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:41,209
all of the
electricity that we

589
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,850
consume for data
centers will

590
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,330
exceed essentially
California's generation.

591
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,169
And it's the biggest
state, right?

592
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,009
Even like mid level

593
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,409
estimates, you know, okay?

594
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:54,089
Not the most conservative,
but mid level

595
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:58,169
ones that are that
are there, okay?

596
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,099
Um, Yeah.

597
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:01,259
And so just for reference,

598
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:02,219
then that's
like, you know,

599
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:03,859
4,000 terawatt
hours is what

600
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,540
the total US
consumption was.

601
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,139
So that number is then
about 10%, right?

602
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,500
So it is about 10%.

603
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,900
There are scenarios
where people

604
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,220
look and they
say about 10%,

605
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,499
right, which
would be up here.

606
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:13,779
At the extreme end.

607
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:16,699
10% of all electricity
consumption in

608
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:18,060
the United States
by 2030 is

609
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,979
going to be a Data
Center, right?

610
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:24,680
So, okay. And the
reason is this, right?

611
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,759
So that only happens
because there is

612
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:29,959
such a demand for compute
from anyone, okay?

613
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,639
So those are sort
of the two tails of

614
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,919
electricity that I see.

615
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,239
If you care about things

616
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,519
like this in the spring,

617
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,359
I'll be teaching
with my colleague,

618
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:41,320
Professor Zodi a
class essentially on

619
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,439
data center modeling and

620
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:46,120
energy management
system modeling.

621
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,479
So we'll go a
lot further into

622
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:49,039
sort of the specifics
of this and

623
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,119
the language and
what goes on.

624
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,480
In terms of,
like, careers,

625
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,560
there's roughly
about 3,000

626
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,760
jobs in this
country that need

627
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,919
somebody who
knows thermal and

628
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,159
really good
modeling for it.

629
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,599
So I think mechanical

630
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,920
engineering is
a very timely,

631
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,949
like, smart thing. Do.

632
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:03,309
A was also very good,

633
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,070
but I mean, there's
nothing that's,

634
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,670
like, in the news
more than that.

635
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,630
Okay? So there's that
the energy conversion,

636
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,029
decarbonizing, and
storage, okay?

637
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,109
So, but before
we get to that,

638
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,109
we got to learn to walk,

639
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:17,629
maybe to crawl, alright?

640
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:23,749
Um, Okay, so we're,
you know, really,

641
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:28,509
thermodynamics is
essentially about

642
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:31,310
starting with
drawing boundaries.

643
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,589
So we talked
really just about,

644
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,149
like, you know,
a box, okay?

645
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:38,229
Into this box, we
put, like, heat.

646
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,110
The box usually
has some mass.

647
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,669
We can put some
work into it.

648
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,989
We can basically take
some work out of it.

649
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:46,309
The boundary that we look

650
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:49,130
at here This can
basically grow.

651
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,889
This can shrink. It should

652
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,130
just sort of
contain whatever

653
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,689
else was had into it.

654
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:57,409
The other thing with
all of this is,

655
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,450
right, this is heat
in, this is workout.

656
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,169
Those are like processes.

657
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,089
A lot of times, if

658
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:05,329
we define sort of the
mass of this thing,

659
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,690
we'll talk about
properties

660
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,330
like temperature
and pressure,

661
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,489
and with that,
we'll be able

662
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:10,649
to say a lot of
things about it.

663
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,889
So this pretty much
talks about the state.

664
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,169
So let's begin with
our first one,

665
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:18,289
and I just want to make
sure that I can see.

666
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,980
Um, So as a beginning
point here,

667
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,379
we can talk about work.

668
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:25,500
So some basic
physics, right?

669
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,579
So our differential of
work here, let's say,

670
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:30,139
in a scenario like
that, it's going to,

671
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:31,019
let's say, if we have

672
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,540
a force that
we're applying.

673
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,299
Here's my dry eraser.

674
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,459
Okay, so let's say,

675
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,310
You know, maybe this
is like a piston.

676
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,989
So what's a piston?
A piston is

677
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:49,749
essentially like a
cylinder, right?

678
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,590
And at the other end,

679
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,389
anyone who's ever, like,

680
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:52,629
filled up a bike
before, you

681
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:53,709
know, a bike tire, right?

682
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,510
You go up and down, and
you compress the air.

683
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,029
So you have here,
like, a piston.

684
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,789
And this piston
could move,

685
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:02,109
you know, some
distance, let's say,

686
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:04,830
you know, you know, DS,

687
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,349
and maybe there's a force,

688
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:06,549
right,

689
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,229
that's being applied
that moves it up, right?

690
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:09,749
So this work
transferred is

691
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:11,829
nothing but that
force times

692
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:16,949
that distance, you
know, move, okay?

693
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,869
So that's sort of the
first thing that we

694
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:21,709
have as a definition
is that. Um, right?

695
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:22,749
The second thing
that I had

696
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,110
mentioned is that we're

697
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,509
largely concerned in order

698
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:26,950
to understand
these processes,

699
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,909
we're largely concerned

700
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:29,070
with what's called states.

701
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,990
To know a state, we
talk about properties.

702
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,430
So things like
temperature,

703
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,709
pressure, and

704
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,910
specific volume are
three of the most,

705
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,589
let's say,
important three of

706
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,589
the most important ones

707
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,929
that are that are there.

708
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:46,389
Okay, to define
a process here.

709
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,390
So let's say this is

710
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,749
at something
like state one.

711
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:50,629
If I were to look
at this, and I let

712
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,309
that piston head expand to

713
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,270
a higher, you know,

714
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,709
position inside here,

715
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,389
I can talk again
about a temperature,

716
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:59,350
a pressure, a
specific volume,

717
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,709
and that's a state two.

718
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:02,950
And pretty much the
whole class is about,

719
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,909
you know, stringing
together, like,

720
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:07,589
really defining
figuring out

721
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:08,469
the properties that we

722
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:09,309
know about the problem,

723
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:10,869
defining them the state,

724
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,510
and then from that moving

725
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,829
to another state,
all right?

726
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,470
And the outputs of
that are things like

727
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,069
work or heat, okay?

728
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:22,589
Cool. Let's move.

729
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:24,350
This is also the cleanest

730
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,869
I've ever seen the white
boards in this room.

731
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:26,989
They're not going
to look this good

732
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:28,590
again for the rest
of the semester.

733
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,669
All right. Okay.

734
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,129
Okay, so let's
now consider

735
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:37,490
instead of our piston,

736
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:37,689
though,

737
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,009
let's consider another
experiment, right?

738
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:41,730
So in this experiment,
let's say we have,

739
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,969
you know, a ground
here, okay?

740
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:46,449
We have a weight.
Let's say that

741
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,649
the weight has
a mass Omega.

742
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:54,489
Let's say that this
weight is attached to Oh,

743
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,610
man, I'm so bad
at drawing.

744
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,329
Right, attached to
a pulley, okay?

745
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:01,610
Okay. Basically,
it's attached

746
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,010
to, like, a pulley,

747
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,169
and maybe this
pulley has some kind

748
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:05,529
of crank and
we can use to,

749
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,129
um, All right,

750
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,690
textual pulley, should
look like that.

751
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,009
The crank that we
can use to, like,

752
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:12,969
rotate and lift that up.

753
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:14,210
And let's say we do that.

754
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,570
So we have some
external actor

755
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,050
that's out here that
starts cranking

756
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,530
this and lifts it, right?

757
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,529
This is then going
to be brought up.

758
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:24,129
Let's see to some
height here.

759
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:25,409
Let's say initially we

760
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:26,889
have some supporting
surface here,

761
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,369
and then we move that in,

762
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,409
and we rest it
there, right?

763
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,889
And then the height
that we have for

764
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:34,650
this displacement
is then age.

765
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,130
So we have a
surface S here,

766
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,169
a weight here, a
pulley, you know,

767
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:39,490
someone literally turning

768
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,409
a crank to raise that up.

769
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,009
This initial state here,

770
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:46,014
we'll call it state one.

771
00:23:46,014 --> 00:23:48,379
This other one here
we'll call as,

772
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:51,879
um, state two, okay?

773
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:52,999
And the reason
why we're able

774
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,279
to move that is right
there is someone

775
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,199
who's outside here
who's transferring that

776
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,359
work in to move it up.

777
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,519
We could also consider
a scenario here where

778
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,719
we let it go back
down to one, right?

779
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,639
And in order to let
that go back down,

780
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:06,239
we'll also, you
know, have to be

781
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,679
applying sort of a
force resisting,

782
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,839
you know, that
movement back to

783
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,320
the surface so that it's
done slowly, right?

784
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,159
And if we look at
going 1-2 to one,

785
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,159
we can talk about

786
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,440
the change in
the work, right?

787
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,624
And that complete
integral there,

788
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:32,129
right is then equal
to zero, right?

789
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:33,449
Because we took
this thing.

790
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,649
We lifted it up to a

791
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:35,849
height very slowly, right?

792
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,809
We didn't do anything

793
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,570
where there was a
lot of friction.

794
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,290
And then we basically
released it,

795
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,890
brought it back down
very slowly to that.

796
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,809
So we did work
to transfer up,

797
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:46,729
and then we
received work or

798
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:49,609
transferred work out
then when it went there,

799
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:50,929
and the result of that of

800
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:52,449
one to two to
one is we have

801
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:57,729
no change in work, okay?

802
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,159
Okay.

803
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,999
Times that.
Cool. All right.

804
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:14,520
So we can do
this experiment.

805
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,879
A similar experiment
again of,

806
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,400
like, raising and
lowering weights.

807
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,679
And the point this time,

808
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,799
let's say this is our
weight, which is here.

809
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,439
Let's say this goes
up again to a pulley.

810
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,199
So we have some
pulley here, right,

811
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,919
where we're, you know,

812
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:32,599
wrapping our rope around.

813
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:36,289
This is then going into
um, a container here.

814
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:39,930
Let's say this container
is full with liquid.

815
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,089
Let's say we can measure

816
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:42,289
the temperature inside

817
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:43,770
here with a thermometer.

818
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,089
And instead of, right,

819
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:48,809
transferring this work,
let's say, you know,

820
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:49,969
out of the system
into what might

821
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:51,210
be like, potential energy,

822
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,489
maybe there's another
weight out here that

823
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:54,249
you're lifting
and lowering.

824
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:57,449
In this case, what
we'd like to do is

825
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:02,649
to dissipate that
with a break, right?

826
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:08,769
So this is basically
a break here, okay?

827
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:15,050
And so if we do,
let's say, um, um,

828
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,090
If we were to
take this from,

829
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,769
let's say, like, a state
one, which is here,

830
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:24,290
and then we lower
that down, you know,

831
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,099
let's say, you know,
some distance.

832
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:28,499
Let's say that distance is

833
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,540
then, you know,
something like,

834
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,739
you know, something
like the H that we had

835
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:35,980
there, we'd have
that process.

836
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,219
Okay? So we can
go one to two

837
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:41,379
with that. All right.

838
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:42,699
So you would take this,

839
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,660
you release some energy.

840
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,659
That'd be transferring
to the b.

841
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:49,060
And the result of that
is that you would heat

842
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,540
up the fluid here, right?

843
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,019
And so my question is,
how do you return?

844
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,460
So if I, again, release
the potential energy,

845
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,979
I heat up the water here,

846
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:00,899
how do you return
back to state one?

847
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:09,419
No. Okay. That's
it, right?

848
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,619
So to go back, you
need to cool, right?

849
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:17,739
To get back to state
one there, right?

850
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:20,019
And what should
be clear from

851
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:25,139
this case is that if we
go one to two to one,

852
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,100
this integral,

853
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,379
right, that we had
written before,

854
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:32,939
it's not equal
to zero, right?

855
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:34,780
This is what we would
call essentially

856
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,059
an irreversible process,

857
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,780
or you've done
something and you can't

858
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,179
get it back, okay?

859
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,180
And People like Joule,

860
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,179
so who the unit of
energy is named after

861
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,460
did a lot of experiments

862
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,620
that were like
this, right?

863
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,819
So a lot of
experiments like

864
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:53,380
that where you raise
and lower the heat,

865
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,819
or especially this type,

866
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:57,339
where you lower
a weight, okay?

867
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,339
So, you know, you
take, you know,

868
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:00,339
some change, let's say,

869
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:02,179
an energy, and
you produce it.

870
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:04,459
You know, you
transfer that then,

871
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,100
you know, and generate

872
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,500
heat in a system, right?

873
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,779
In the 19th century,

874
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:09,659
this was, like,
a big problem.

875
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:10,419
People used to take,

876
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:11,900
like, cannon bores, right?

877
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,779
And they would, you know,

878
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,260
try to bore them out.

879
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,500
And at that time, people

880
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,779
didn't really
understand what he was.

881
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,819
They thought it was
called caloric theory.

882
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:21,659
They thought it flowed,
you know, like water,

883
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,339
basically, um, um, you
know, flows there.

884
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,260
And so these were,

885
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,579
like, deep questions
that they were,

886
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,779
you know, concerned
with was the

887
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,139
mechanisms and
what went on.

888
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,500
And so what Jewel did

889
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,900
is through like
a series of,

890
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,099
like, weights and

891
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:35,539
lowering them
different heights,

892
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,900
and then measuring the
change in temperature,

893
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,539
what he showed was that,

894
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:46,310
um, dq, which stands
for heat, right, minus.

895
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,309
So this is heap in

896
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,909
minus the
complete integral

897
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:53,109
of work transferred out

898
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:55,189
was then equal
to zero, okay?

899
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:57,270
This is called sometimes
the mechanical

900
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,109
equivalent of
heat, all right?

901
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:00,629
So it may be
obvious to us now,

902
00:29:00,629 --> 00:29:02,389
but again, I can't
emphasize enough that,

903
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:03,870
like, people used to
think that it was

904
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,069
like he was a
substance, all right?

905
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:09,999
Um, This is one statement

906
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:13,239
of the first law of
thermodynamics, right?

907
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,720
So I you know,

908
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,280
one way to look at
the first law is

909
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,119
that energy is conserved.

910
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,920
So if I take all of

911
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,199
the net heat right

912
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,680
into this system,
you know,

913
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,559
doing that whole
process and all of

914
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,919
the network that's
transferred out of that,

915
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,240
the difference
between that for

916
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,639
a closed system
like that should be

917
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,199
equal to zero, okay?

918
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,579
So yeah, essentially,
this is first law.

919
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:50,159
All right. Okay.
This is good.

920
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,359
I want to bring
back my one.

921
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,399
I promise a lot better
board management

922
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,639
once my camera gets fixed.

923
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,879
Alright? Okay.

924
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,040
Okay, so now let's
consider the following.

925
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,159
Let's say that we
have a state zero,

926
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,959
which is here, and let's

927
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,439
say this is a
state one, okay?

928
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:35,679
And let's say that we
have a process of going

929
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,039
from state one to

930
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,839
state zero, which
we'll call A.

931
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,439
And we'll consider
two trips back, okay?

932
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,599
Let's say the direct way,

933
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,984
and let's call path C
the scenic route, okay?

934
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:52,770
That was a dead joke.
All right, fine.

935
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:58,489
Scenic drone. Okay.
Um. All right.

936
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:03,729
So from a statement
that we have there,

937
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,089
what we can
write then is in

938
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:08,049
the integral from one A

939
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:15,450
to zero of dq minus dw,

940
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:20,129
plus the integral then
of zero B to one.

941
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:24,049
So zero B to one of

942
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:29,729
dq minus dw is equal
to zero. All right?

943
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,889
Now, we can consider
the same thing,

944
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,529
but a return trip as,

945
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:35,449
again, the scenic
route, right?

946
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:42,330
So we have one A to
zero dq minus dw,

947
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:47,529
plus the integral
of zero C to

948
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:54,179
one of dq minus dw, right?

949
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,739
And so if we combine these

950
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,100
two, these two terms,

951
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,939
this is going to subtract,

952
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:00,539
and so this term and
this term are going

953
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,859
to be equivalent, right?

954
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:08,259
So our integral of
zero to one B of our

955
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,699
dq minus dw is equal to

956
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:19,420
zero C to one
of dq minus dw.

957
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:29,539
Yeah. Okay. So let's
move that one there.

958
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:31,659
Let's bring it back.

959
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,819
Yeah. Okay. So.

960
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,099
So the integral of

961
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,459
basically the
difference of

962
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:53,020
dQ and minus dw

963
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,339
is essentially fixed by

964
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,579
the endpoints, all right?

965
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:58,580
Yes, please. Go ahead.

966
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,900
Heat. It's like
heat transfer.

967
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,340
So Q and thermodynamics
is heat transfer.

968
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,500
Other questions?
Clarifications? Yes, please.

969
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,539
Name Zach.

970
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,339
No, this should just
be one. I'm sorry.

971
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:18,219
So one is the start.

972
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:20,474
I apologize. Thank you
for catching that.

973
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:24,049
Okay. This should
be zero B, yes.

974
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,090
You get up here

975
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,970
and I don't know
what happens.

976
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,209
Suddenly, like letters

977
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:28,290
change. I'm not kidding.

978
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:32,529
Okay. Other questions?
Okay. Thank you.

979
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:35,769
All right. All right.

980
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:38,129
So the point is that

981
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,930
and I'll get
into it later,

982
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:47,010
but the point of
this is that this dQ

983
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,409
minus this DW all I need
to know to have this

984
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:52,049
is essentially the final

985
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,089
and the initial
states, okay?

986
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:56,649
And the same then for

987
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:58,849
the other process, okay?

988
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,999
So what we can write
then is that E one,

989
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,039
so let's call
that energy in

990
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:11,799
the system minus E
zero is then the

991
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:21,930
integral 0-1 of
dq minus dw,

992
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:26,169
which is then equal
to Q minus W, right?

993
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:28,090
So this is basically
the energy

994
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,609
right in the system
at state one.

995
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:31,569
This is the energy in

996
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,249
the system at state zero.

997
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:36,049
Q is the heat transferred
into the system,

998
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:38,649
and W is the work
transferred out, okay?

999
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:40,449
In mechanical
engineering and

1000
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,850
thermal here, that's
the convention.

1001
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,089
If you see Q, and it
doesn't say in or out,

1002
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:46,929
it is positive when
you transfer in,

1003
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,969
and W is positive when
it's transferred out.

1004
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,049
And the reason
for that is if

1005
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,530
you think about
a power plant,

1006
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,409
you put heat into it

1007
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,849
and you get work
out of it, right?

1008
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,609
That's the way to
remember. If you go

1009
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:00,610
to physics, They're weird.

1010
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,249
Sorry. And they do things

1011
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:05,289
differently, all
right? Okay.

1012
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,049
All right, so we can

1013
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:09,169
take the differential
of this, right?

1014
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:10,129
So then we can talk about

1015
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:11,690
D, right being equal

1016
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,690
to dQ minus R dw.

1017
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,289
And this is what
I would say is

1018
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,649
a very common
way that you'll

1019
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,169
see the first law written.

1020
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:21,929
So the change in
the energy of

1021
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:24,569
your system is equal
to the change and

1022
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:25,809
the amount is equal to

1023
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:27,450
the amount of heat
transferred in minus

1024
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,609
the amount of work

1025
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:31,369
transferred
out, all right?

1026
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,669
Okay.

1027
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,789
Were to also go with this.

1028
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,869
We generally don't care

1029
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,509
about the absolute
amount of energy, right?

1030
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:43,029
If we care about
a process, like

1031
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:43,669
I mentioned before,

1032
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:44,989
you care about difference.

1033
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:46,669
If you went in
and you wanted

1034
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:48,589
to tally up all the
energy in something,

1035
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:50,189
right, you'd have to
talk about, you know,

1036
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,389
your kinetic
energies, your

1037
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:53,109
potential energies,
any magnetism,

1038
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,069
capillarity, and whatever
that goes into it,

1039
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,749
it gets exhausting, right?

1040
00:35:56,749 --> 00:35:58,890
Um, Again, as an engineer,

1041
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,529
you don't really care

1042
00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:00,609
about the absolute value,

1043
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:01,889
but you do care about
the difference, right?

1044
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:03,169
So go from something hot

1045
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:04,649
to cold, that's there.

1046
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:05,889
That's something that's
going to be done.

1047
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:07,089
And so what you'll do is

1048
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:08,489
you'll talk about
a reference state.

1049
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:09,249
So when we get into

1050
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:10,529
properties,
you'll say, okay,

1051
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:11,129
here is

1052
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:13,529
some arbitrarily chosen
reference state.

1053
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:15,009
We all agree on it, like

1054
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:16,449
we all agree on
the time for

1055
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:17,969
whatever reason in the UK

1056
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:19,569
that we have GMT zero.

1057
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,529
We accept that
in the same way

1058
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:23,290
in our tables in
our calculations,

1059
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,849
there's going to be
some reference value,

1060
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,209
and we compute property
changes in and

1061
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:31,589
around, um, that, okay?

1062
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,509
So again, there's
no absolute value.

1063
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,469
Well, there could be
an absolute value

1064
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:37,470
of what we call here
is internal energy.

1065
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,829
But again, we don't care.

1066
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,829
That's not questions
that we ask

1067
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:43,789
in this in this
class, okay?

1068
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:46,569
Um, okay.

1069
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,549
This is a property, right?

1070
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:49,829
Internal energy
is a property.

1071
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:51,149
If I know the
temperature and

1072
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:52,309
the pressure or

1073
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:53,949
the specific volume
of my system,

1074
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:55,470
I know the
internal energy,

1075
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,869
okay? It's a property.

1076
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:00,589
Heat and work, I cannot
stress this enough,

1077
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:04,909
are not properties,
right? They're not.

1078
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,589
You know, you
transfer heat in,

1079
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:10,469
you transfer
work out, okay?

1080
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:13,029
When we think about
the, you know,

1081
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:14,989
the and where
you transfer it

1082
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:17,149
in and out are at
boundaries, right?

1083
00:37:17,149 --> 00:37:19,749
So you look at, you
know, let's say, again,

1084
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:23,979
back to our piston
example, Right?

1085
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:26,259
So, if this is,

1086
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:28,459
let's say, the, you know,

1087
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:32,659
what I define as the
boundary of my system,

1088
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,779
you'd be transferring heat

1089
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:37,020
in at that boundary.

1090
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,939
You'd be transferring work

1091
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:42,019
also out of that, okay?

1092
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:43,619
What you'll see in

1093
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,899
the textbook to
drive this home,

1094
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:50,259
the fact that this
is not a property,

1095
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:52,819
is that this D, a lot of

1096
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:55,784
times will be written
as like a Delta, okay?

1097
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:58,269
And this Delta,
what it means

1098
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,749
is it's an inexact
differential.

1099
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:02,549
What the hell does
that mean for us?

1100
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:05,029
It means you need to
know the process.

1101
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:06,549
Like, you need
to know every

1102
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:08,069
single little
change there.

1103
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:09,669
You have to have
complete information

1104
00:38:09,669 --> 00:38:12,430
about it in order
to integrate.

1105
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,109
I'll make it clear
later how we do that,

1106
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:15,229
but that's why
they'll write

1107
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:17,349
delta in the textbook.

1108
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:19,630
Again, because
internal energy,

1109
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,069
this is a property, and

1110
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:22,269
the properties
only depend on

1111
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,990
the starting and
the end states.

1112
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,069
You have an exact
differential

1113
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:28,149
for that, a D, okay?

1114
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:31,899
Cool. To, to do.

1115
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:33,980
So what you should
not write, let's

1116
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,819
see if we stick with
our example there,

1117
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:38,499
you should not
write W zero.

1118
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:40,299
You should not
write W one.

1119
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:41,219
That doesn't make sense.

1120
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,380
But something
like maybe w01,

1121
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,459
that might make
sense, right?

1122
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:47,619
Because that's a process
between two states.

1123
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,219
The same might be said
of something like

1124
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:52,899
third quarter
one there, okay?

1125
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:59,829
Great. Yeah.

1126
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:02,950
Okay, so again, this
is just some basics.

1127
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,470
Again, I'll try to
make this exciting,

1128
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,229
and we'll connect
it back to I mean,

1129
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,029
I think this's super
exciting, but, like,

1130
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:10,109
we'll connect it back
to the rest later.

1131
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:12,029
But again, in every
thermal problem,

1132
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:13,549
the most important thing,

1133
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,069
the very first
thing you should

1134
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:18,550
do is to draw a boundary.

1135
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,749
You look at a system and

1136
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:23,209
your first reaction
on a quiz or a test,

1137
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:24,829
is you draw

1138
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:25,429
a nice picture,

1139
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,549
better than what
I've done here.

1140
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:28,069
I know you're
capable, and then

1141
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:29,789
you draw the boundary
to it, right?

1142
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:31,709
And what we
call that here,

1143
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:33,070
so we draw that boundary,

1144
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,149
the area contained in it.

1145
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:38,869
The term is the
control volume, right?

1146
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:40,429
And again, the
whole purpose

1147
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:42,149
of this course
is looking at

1148
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,470
the ways that
we can exchange

1149
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,470
energy in and out of
the control volume.

1150
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,869
For this, we're
looking at heat

1151
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:48,349
in and out, work
in and out.

1152
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:50,950
Later on, when we think
about data centers,

1153
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,070
when we think
about turbines,

1154
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,789
when we think about that,

1155
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:53,669
we're also going
to be able to

1156
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:54,629
bring in a fluid, right?

1157
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:55,509
We're going to
be able to bring

1158
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:56,429
in mass in and out,

1159
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,669
and that's the third
way that you can

1160
00:39:57,669 --> 00:40:02,749
exchange energy
there, okay?

1161
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,550
Great. What else
am I missing?

1162
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,589
We're doing super
today. We're like,

1163
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:11,189
amazingly on time.

1164
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:12,629
You guys are a
great group.

1165
00:40:12,629 --> 00:40:15,949
Okay, so I've exhausted
my notes on all that.

1166
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,789
So I just have some
closing remarks then,

1167
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:18,829
and then I can
release you all

1168
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:20,109
early to go to
your homework one,

1169
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:21,269
two, and three before,

1170
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,270
you know, next lecture.

1171
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,589
So, this is a quote from

1172
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,749
a very famous
German professor

1173
00:40:27,749 --> 00:40:29,150
Arnold Sommerfeld.

1174
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,469
So first statement,
you know,

1175
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,790
thermo is a funny subject.

1176
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,629
The first time you
go through it,

1177
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:33,789
you don't understand
it at all.

1178
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:35,029
The second time
you go through it,

1179
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:36,069
you think you
get it except

1180
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,150
for one or two parts.

1181
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,469
The third time you
go through it,

1182
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,629
you know you don't
understand it,

1183
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:40,989
but by that time,
you're used to it

1184
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:42,949
and it doesn't bother
you anymore, okay?

1185
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,669
So anyways, he was

1186
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:46,710
very famous. He
was very famous.

1187
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,310
He himself didn't win
any Nobel Prizes,

1188
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,429
but a bunch of his
students, you know, did.

1189
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:53,709
Maybe they didn't
need it three

1190
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,549
times to take it.

1191
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:57,509
So this is where you
are sort of today,

1192
00:40:57,509 --> 00:40:58,669
you're going through it.

1193
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:00,990
You know, by the end
of this, hopefully,

1194
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,789
you know, you'll
be ready for

1195
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:04,309
the next part there.

1196
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:06,030
Thank you all today.
Great turnout.

1197
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,669
If you have any questions,

1198
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:07,829
I'm up here for the
next few minutes.

1199
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:10,190
I'm looking forward
to the semester.
