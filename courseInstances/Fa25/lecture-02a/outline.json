The internal energy of **ideal gases** is stored through several mechanisms that contribute to sensible energy, including **translational** energy (simple movement of the molecules).

All these molecular and atomic movements are the **mechanisms that contribute to the total internal energy** of the system.",

This process continues until **thermal equilibrium** is reached, where all parts of the system are at the same temperature and **no further heat transfer occurs**. A molecular dynamics simulation can demonstrate this: a partition of high-velocity (hot) molecules will cool down, while a partition of low-velocity (cold) molecules will increase in temperature until they reach the same, intermediate temperature. The **direction of heat transfer** is determined *only* by the **temperature difference ($\\\\Delta T$)** and is independent of the mass or total internal energy of the objects involved. When two systems are in contact but **mass transfer is not allowed**, the boundary is referred to as a **diathermal wall**.",

This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\\\\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\\\\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.",

      "detailed_summary": "For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\\\\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\\\\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.",

This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\\\\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\\\\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\\\\Delta U = Q$.",

      "detailed_summary": "This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\\\\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$).
