A **spring example** is analyzed using **Hook's law** to derive the work done as **$\frac{1}{2}KX^2$**, assuming a **slow, reversible process**. The **First Law of Thermodynamics** ($\\Delta E_{system} = E_{in} - E_{out}$) is applied, where $\\Delta E$ includes **internal, kinetic, and potential energy**, and energy transfer is via **work (W) or heat (Q)**. For the slow spring compression, the energy balance simplifies to **$\\Delta PE = W_{in}$**. The effect of **rapid stretching** is discussed, noting it causes the system to **warm up** due to a sudden reduction of **entropy**.",

Energy transfer across a control volume boundary is classified as **work** if the **electrons cross the boundary** (e.g., drawing the boundary across the wires of a resistor), but as **heat** if the **boundary is drawn around the heating element** and the surrounding air (e.g., heat transfer from the hot resistor).

The goal is to determine the final temperature ($T_2$) and the heat transferred out ($Q_{out}$). The First Law simplifies to $\\Delta U = -Q_{out}$ because for an **isochoric process, work is zero** ($W_{in} = W_{out} = 0$). For an ideal gas, the **change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) depends only on temperature**. Using the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$)**, the relation is $m c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{out}$. The **ideal gas equation** ($p v = R T$) is then used to compute the state properties needed to find $T_2$ and $Q_{out}$.",
