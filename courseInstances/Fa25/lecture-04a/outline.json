      "topics": ["Closed Systems"],
      "detailed_summary": "This segment analyzes the net work and energy transfer for a **thermodynamic cycle** shown on a P-V diagram. The key point established is that the **net work out ($W_{net, out}$)** of a closed-system cycle is graphically represented by the **area enclosed by the cycleâ€™s path** on the P-V diagram. By applying the **First Law of Thermodynamics** ($\\\\Delta U = Q_{net, in} - W_{net, out}$) to a cycle, and recognizing that the **change in internal energy ($\\\\Delta U$) is zero** (since the system returns to its initial state), the lecturer concludes that the **net work output must equal the net heat input ($W_{net, out} = Q_{net, in}$)**. This relationship is a fundamental concept for analyzing engines and other cyclic devices.",
