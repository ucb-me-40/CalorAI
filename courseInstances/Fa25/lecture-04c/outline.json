The process involves **electrical work transferred in ($W_{e, in}$) and heat transfer ($Q$)** while the system is maintained at **constant pressure**. The key theoretical derivation shows that for a constant pressure closed system, the boundary work can be absorbed into the internal energy term ($U$), resulting in a simplified energy balance where $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = \Delta H$ (or $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$). The example is solved using **superheated steam tables** to determine the final temperature and the change in enthalpy.",

For these substances, the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$) is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$)**, and both are generally represented as $c$.
