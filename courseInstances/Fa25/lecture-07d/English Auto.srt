1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,039
All right, I got 210.

2
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:06,160
So today, we're going to

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,880
get into entropy
analysis, right?

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,520
So till now we've
done entropy,

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,720
and now today
we're going to use

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,700
it for analysis, right.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,459
We're starting to
check off a bunch of

8
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:19,620
these major learning
objectives.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,099
Yeah, so today, you'll be

10
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:28,260
able to analyze
a compressor.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,859
So we'll talk about a
compressor and ways

12
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,699
to make it more

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,819
effective involving
inter cooling.

14
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:37,259
And then we'll start with

15
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,219
a general entropy
balance and

16
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,500
apply this to a
heat exchanger.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,109
Okay, so before that,

18
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:46,359
to understand if
you understand

19
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,999
this property, okay?

20
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:49,599
So, you're all here.

21
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,319
So yes, you're the
few in the product.

22
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,600
So in this problem,
what you're

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,839
given is a
reversible process.

24
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:57,719
So let's say a steady
flow reversible process

25
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,599
that's going from states
one to two to three.

26
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:02,999
You have a plot here of

27
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:04,800
temperature in
degrees Celsius

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
versus specific entropy

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,440
on the horizontal axis.

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,079
And the question is,
in going 1-2 to three,

31
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,040
what is the total
heat transfer

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,919
for this reversible
process?

33
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,839
Okay? 2 minutes.

34
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:18,599
We take a quick
check on you,

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,360
and then if you pass,

36
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,839
I will proceed, and then
if not, we will see.

37
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,710
Any questions?

38
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,109
Great. It's a good
intimate crowd today.

39
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:31,430
Thank you. I'll circulate.

40
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,710
Let's see what
their correctness.

41
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,029
I never even get to
this part of it.

42
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:36,750
Yeah, there you go. Okay.
Now, suddenly, 44%.

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,789
Awesome. I'm happy.
I can go on.

44
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:43,990
Say it again. Sorry.

45
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,149
Okay.

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,629
Okay. So before I get

47
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:01,069
into the whole entropy
analysis and that,

48
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:01,869
I just want to take

49
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:03,150
a step back and
then remind

50
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,469
ourselves of

51
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:05,829
what we've been
analyzing, right?

52
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,989
So, essentially, we've

53
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:08,189
had two types of systems,

54
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:10,470
one which we called
as a closed system,

55
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,350
right, piston cylinders.
No mass in or out.

56
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,830
The only way we can
exchange energy

57
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,230
is through heater
work, okay?

58
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,590
Good. We had a
second system

59
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,750
where we could where
it was open, right?

60
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,230
We call these control
volumes, okay?

61
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,189
You know, the book

62
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:26,590
calls these
control volumes.

63
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,190
I would call it kind
of an you know,

64
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,350
it's an open system.

65
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,230
You can bring
heat and work in,

66
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,870
but you can also
bring in mass, right?

67
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,270
So in bringing mass in,

68
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,470
mass can also bring
energy into it, okay?

69
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,150
So that's really the two
differences with it.

70
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,630
When we analyze this one,

71
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,030
we tended to talk
about, like,

72
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,510
a delta U is equal
to something, right?

73
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,070
And here, we talked about,

74
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,350
like, rate
notation, right?

75
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,789
So we'd say,
like, the rate of

76
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,110
change of work
in, you know,

77
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,110
w.in, W dot out
there, okay?

78
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,800
We speak about
the work, right,

79
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,520
the type of
work, you know,

80
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
work transfer useful work

81
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,479
that can be transferred
out of the system.

82
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,800
In the case of a
piston, right,

83
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
that was PDV, right?

84
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,920
So we have
pressure, right?

85
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,520
We'll be integrating PDV,

86
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,520
and that would get us
to some useful work.

87
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,599
In the case of
the open system,

88
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,160
so things like a
turbine or, like,

89
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,720
the pinwheel example,
right there,

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
it's VDP, okay, right?

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,880
Here, the volume changes,

92
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,760
and here it
does not, okay?

93
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,959
And the way that this one

94
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,360
produces then work
is because you

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,640
have big pressure
differences that

96
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
are across those
devices, right?

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,850
So PDV and VDP there Okay.

98
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,690
Great. What I'd like to
do now is then this,

99
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,530
remember I said at

100
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,690
the beginning,
we're going to,

101
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,130
you know, see about
ways that we can design

102
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,289
compressor systems to
be more efficient.

103
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,490
And I'm going to show
you this example here.

104
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,490
So in this example,
you're doing

105
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,009
two stages of compression.

106
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:57,489
And in between
the two stages,

107
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,290
you do what's called
intercooling, okay?

108
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,890
You basically
cool it, right?

109
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,130
What's the logic
behind doing this?

110
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,850
If I take a gas and
I compress it there,

111
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,489
even if I do it
isotropically,

112
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,250
it's going to get
very hot, okay?

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,130
You're going to get it's

114
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,305
going to get pretty hot.

115
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,719
And then if I go
again and I try

116
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:19,360
to compress now
that very hot gas,

117
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,239
you can imagine that maybe

118
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,959
that might be more
difficult to do, okay?

119
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,239
So you put all
that work in,

120
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,919
you put a lot of
energy in, okay?

121
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,360
You get it to a
high pressure.

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,759
You take heat out without

123
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,320
basically changing
the pressure,

124
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,960
and then you go
on and compress.

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,359
And the purpose of
this example is

126
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,840
to illustrate that by

127
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,199
doing this cooling stage,

128
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,280
actually you can
reduce the amount of,

129
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,519
let's say, electricity you

130
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,600
would need to
run this, right?

131
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
And this is used, right?

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,839
This is a system
that's actually

133
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,839
that's actually
used, right?

134
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,319
What I'm showing
you on the right is

135
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,920
essentially the solution
to what we have.

136
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,159
So where is this
going right

137
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,599
before I get
deeply into it?

138
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:56,239
The blue line. So
we start here,

139
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,319
right? So this is air.

140
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,639
We're starting off at

141
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,079
100 PA in 27 degrees
Celsius, right?

142
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,399
So it's like, you

143
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,360
know, room temperature
conditions.

144
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,160
In the blue stage, right?

145
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,799
And the dashed
black line that I

146
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,680
have here is the isobar.

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
So this is the line
of constant pressure

148
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,325
on this TS diagram.

149
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:17,649
If I just did
a single stage

150
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,049
of compression, all right?

151
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:19,770
I could do that,

152
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,929
so I could go
from this state

153
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:21,290
up to

154
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,369
the higher pressure
that's totally valid.

155
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:25,810
Or we could do what I'm
showing here where I

156
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,409
go up to some you know,

157
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,969
I compress up to
some pressure, okay?

158
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:32,209
I cool it, and

159
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,449
then I basically
do the same thing.

160
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,130
I basically compress
again and I get

161
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,050
onto the same
cobar, right?

162
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,489
What you can
anticipate from

163
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:40,729
this heat transfer process

164
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,689
is what changes
from here to here?

165
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:43,369
What do you see?

166
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:43,970
Like what's

167
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,969
the first thing
that's different for

168
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,129
you on that plot from

169
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:48,254
the right to
the left there?

170
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:51,260
Okay. Every value
is a lower.

171
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,939
It's entropy lower, right?

172
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,819
And so what does it mean

173
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:54,819
if I go from here to here?

174
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,739
So if I have an entropy
value that's here,

175
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:57,819
and then I go to it here,

176
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,499
what does that mean?

177
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,699
Or let me say
it another way.

178
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,659
I told you before
about a relationship

179
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:08,299
between entropy
and heat, okay?

180
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,660
So am I putting heat

181
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,259
into this or am I
taking heat out of it,

182
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,820
if I'm decreasing entropy.

183
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,459
You're taking
heat out, okay?

184
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,180
So that's the key
thing. Now I'm

185
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,299
going to give
you math, right?

186
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:18,699
But just remember
this is where

187
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:26,439
we're at. All right.

188
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,679
Do do do do.

189
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,409
Okay. All right,

190
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,849
so our substance
here, right?

191
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,170
So the substance

192
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,809
we're working with
in this case,

193
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,609
we have air here.

194
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,089
The mass flow
rate that we're

195
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,530
told in this problem is

196
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,769
what I'm telling you
is in the problem,

197
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:55,729
the MDOT here is

198
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:01,489
equal to 0.15
kilograms/second.

199
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,609
We have our initial state.

200
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:07,049
So if we talk about
state one, All right.

201
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,449
State one, we
have a P one,

202
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,810
which is 100 PA.

203
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,929
We have a T one,
which is then

204
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:16,410
equal to 27
degrees Celsius.

205
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,929
And what it means is
that if we use Pi CLR,

206
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,730
I'd be able to
know enthalpy

207
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,529
one and entropy one
from this, right?

208
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,009
So I have complete
information by

209
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,569
having this there.

210
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,290
We're going to assume.

211
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,610
So let's make
some assumptions.

212
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,889
So some assumptions
we're going to make.

213
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,449
Assumptions. All right.

214
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,049
We're going to assume
that this is right,

215
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,290
so this is a steady flow.

216
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:48,859
Device, the compressors

217
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:56,619
are reversible
plus adiabatic,

218
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:04,389
which means
Isotropic, okay?

219
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,709
Right? So this implies

220
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,910
that they're isentropic.

221
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,789
Neglect, right?

222
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,950
We neglect Delta KE,

223
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,109
you know, and Delta PE.

224
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:24,629
Cool. For State two,

225
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:31,989
so if we analyze into
State two for this, we,

226
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:36,000
um We are told

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,040
that the pressure
at state two,

228
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,920
let me see how
I'm looking here.

229
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,560
This is better.
The pressure at

230
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,280
state two is equal to

231
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,360
some ratio times the
pressure at state one.

232
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,920
And this ratio R here,

233
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,200
we're told is 2.5, okay?

234
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,279
Later on, this is not
going to be uncommon.

235
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,999
We're going to,
like, a lot of

236
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:58,960
the problems are
not going to tell

237
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
you what pressure two is.

238
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,839
They're going to say
things like ratio,

239
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,760
compression ratio,
and later here.

240
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
So here we just
have a ratio of

241
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,520
R of 2.5, right?

242
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,179
Um Because these
operate isotropically,

243
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,179
what we can say is that

244
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,419
S two specific entropy

245
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:19,780
S two is equal
to S one, right?

246
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,020
And from this,
then we know H

247
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,980
two and we know
and we know S two.

248
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:36,360
All right. And State
three, State three.

249
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,120
What do we know
about State three?

250
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,080
State three, we know let

251
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,640
me back up a second
here really quick.

252
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,760
So we know H two,

253
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,080
we know S two, and,

254
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
of course, from
this, we know P two.

255
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,520
All right. All right.

256
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,080
Um,

257
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,450
Right?

258
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,769
This is a heat exchanger.

259
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,769
So what you're
doing here is

260
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:05,770
basically a
heat exchanger.

261
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,969
And in this class, when we

262
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:08,290
deal with heat
exchanger devices,

263
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,409
we assume we don't have

264
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,330
pressure drops
across them.

265
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,170
So what it means
is that P three

266
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,370
is equal to P two,

267
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,290
and we know T
three, right?

268
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,209
T three is given us
27 degrees Celsius.

269
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:25,290
So it means now we
know enthal P three,

270
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,410
and we know entra
P three there.

271
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,180
For state four, Okay,

272
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,339
we're told that P
four is equal to

273
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,100
that same ratio
times P three.

274
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,220
So we know that.
And because

275
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,300
this is a reversible
and adiabatic,

276
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,140
we're going to say that S

277
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,180
four is equal to
little S three,

278
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,220
and it means that
we'll know H three.

279
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,740
And if we wanted, we could

280
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,699
compute or I'm sorry,

281
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,660
H four and T four,

282
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,860
let's say, if we wanted
to know that, right?

283
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,420
But we have complete
information

284
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,200
then it's state four.

285
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,060
Mm hmm, hmm. Okay.

286
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,460
So we've oriented
ourselves.

287
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,020
Now what we can get into
is is the analysis.

288
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,820
So again, here we
have let's draw this.

289
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,500
So I have here, right?
I have an inlet.

290
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,459
I have here,
let's say this is

291
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,860
the heat exchanger like

292
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:34,100
this into a second
stage of compression.

293
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,900
Okay. Here. And then
this is out, right?

294
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,820
I have aw.in for that.

295
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,340
This is our state one,

296
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,460
our state two, our state

297
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,300
three, and our state four.

298
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,340
You can draw some
control volumes, right?

299
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,719
I would say this is
the control volume

300
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,680
of compressor one.

301
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,719
We can do a control volume

302
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,559
of the heat exchanger,

303
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,439
and then we can do
a control volume

304
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:13,280
of the second
compressor. All right.

305
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,000
So let's call this
maybe CV one,

306
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:24,840
CV two and CV three
there, all right?

307
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,480
Okay, so let's say the

308
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,320
w.in then of
control volume

309
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
one is equal
to, all right?

310
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,160
That's the M dot, right?

311
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,640
This is basically M dot
times the enthalpy at

312
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,919
state two minus the

313
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,040
enthalpy at state
one, all right?

314
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm not going to
go through and,

315
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,160
like, simplify, right.

316
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,880
You know,

317
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,200
this is what I know
from the problem.

318
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,920
We have a Q dot.

319
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,620
Out that's happening 2-3.

320
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,660
So then we have a Q dot

321
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,860
out for control
volume two,

322
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,340
and that's again
equal to the M dot.

323
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,780
And here, right, H
two is going to have

324
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,260
a higher enthalpy
than H three,

325
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,020
so this is going to
be H two minus H

326
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,140
three for the out term.

327
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,339
And then for the w.in,

328
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:26,300
so w.in for control
volume, let's say three.

329
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,660
This is going to be
dot times H three,

330
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,619
because it's a
higher enthalpy

331
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:34,740
minus H, nope,
that's wrong.

332
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:41,660
H4h4 minus H three there.

333
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,280
All right. And
so the total,

334
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,000
then the total work then.

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,360
So the question that
we were asked is,

336
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,839
assuming the compression

337
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,160
process to be isotropic,

338
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,600
determine the power input

339
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,840
to the compressor for

340
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,600
the mass flow rate
that we gave.

341
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,840
And then we'll do the
same analysis then

342
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,560
for the case when we don't

343
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,240
when we have just

344
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,479
basically a
single compressor

345
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,600
going from state one
to state four, right?

346
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,880
So for this one, though,

347
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,160
w.in, is going to

348
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,920
be equal to w.in for
control volume one.

349
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,920
+w.in for control
volume three, okay?

350
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,720
And the value that I have,

351
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,520
so again, how do we
compute this, right?

352
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,360
We determine H one, H two,

353
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,880
H three and H four.

354
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,760
The M dot was given as
0.15 kilograms/second.

355
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,919
So if you substitute
in those values,

356
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,360
I have aw.in kilowatts of

357
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,840
27.1 of W dot N, right?

358
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,880
Okay. Now, we can

359
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,040
analyze this as a as
a single stage two.

360
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,080
So if we do a single
stage, right?

361
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,160
So what we're doing
here is, let's see.

362
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,840
This is my
compressor here,

363
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,599
here's my inlet,
here's my outlet.

364
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,280
W.in. He's state one.

365
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,840
And we can call
this one as,

366
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,800
like, two prime, okay?

367
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,040
T prime. All right.

368
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:42,000
Do to do. We know
state one, right?

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,240
So state one was
again given to us.

370
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
So we know this already.

371
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,520
So state one,

372
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,840
and from this we know H

373
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,560
one and we know S one.

374
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,279
That doesn't change
in the system.

375
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,640
For state two prime,

376
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,480
state let's say
two prime here.

377
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,360
What's the
pressure relative

378
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,920
to what we had in
the first problem.

379
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,860
Say it again.
That's right.

380
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,460
Exactly. So
it's out there.

381
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,380
It's on this.

382
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,859
So we can write the 625 PA

383
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,259
or if I want to
make it relative

384
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,700
to what I had for
the other one,

385
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,620
that would be at at
state four, right?

386
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,220
From state four of what we

387
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,300
had before, but yes, here,

388
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:42,860
625 PA. All right.

389
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,260
And what else do we assume

390
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,780
here? You're on a roll.

391
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:59,750
S two prime. You're
a numerical guy.

392
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,030
I like that. Yeah, sure.

393
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,390
That's the right
one, or we would

394
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,229
say it's one here, right?

395
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:06,829
So it's one on this.

396
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,829
And from here, then
you would know

397
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,149
your enthalpy two
prime, right?

398
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:16,390
And then if you
go in, then w.in

399
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,269
for this system is

400
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,110
going to be equal to

401
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,949
the same dot that
we had before,

402
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,829
and it's going
to be then H two

403
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,069
prime minus H one.

404
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,269
And if you substitute
numbers in there,

405
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:36,629
I get 331.1 kilowatts

406
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:39,629
for a single stage
without intercooling,

407
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:40,749
okay?

408
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,789
This is a bigger number
than this, okay?

409
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,229
It's easy to
cool something.

410
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:52,429
Sometimes cooling is
for free, all right?

411
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,509
And so this may make sense

412
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,789
then in a system
to go into

413
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,389
a single stage
of compression,

414
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:00,069
cool the cast off, send

415
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:01,630
it back into
another compressor.

416
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,469
And what you'll see

417
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,709
is the work
required there is

418
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,470
less than the case
of a single stage.

419
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,790
Even if this is isotropic
as a single stage,

420
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,429
it's still more work to do

421
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,269
the single stage
compression here than to do

422
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:17,799
this, cool this, okay?

423
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,529
Does that make
sense? Are there

424
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:22,650
questions about this
analysis? Yes, please.

425
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,409
What's the
difference between P

426
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,089
two and P two prime.

427
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,729
So P two prime here.

428
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:32,729
So P two is like in
this problem, right?

429
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,129
This is like halfway to

430
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:35,529
the final pressure of the

431
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,249
625 we want to
get to, right?

432
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,649
So P two here is like

433
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:41,009
an intermediate
pressure on

434
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:43,165
the way to P four
in this system.

435
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,039
P two primed here

436
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
is like I do this
in one shot, right?

437
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,880
I start off at
atmospheric pressure,

438
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,120
and I compress all the way

439
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,879
to P two prime here.

440
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:55,559
And where we want
to go is 625 PA.

441
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,639
So here, it's
like I go from

442
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:00,239
here to here in one go.

443
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,319
And so the P two
prime relative to

444
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,400
the first problem is it's

445
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,759
equal to P four, okay?

446
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,440
Other questions?
Yes. Louder.

447
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,859
Sounds like a good
homework problem.

448
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,139
So if we reverse it,

449
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:22,019
if we reverse it,

450
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,579
actually, it sounds like
a good quiz problem.

451
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:31,939
If we reverse it, will
it be better, okay?

452
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,739
So I think your
problem statement

453
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:38,419
is if I were

454
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:40,780
to so I go

455
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,260
with something that's
at very high pressure.

456
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,420
So let's say to
keep it analogous.

457
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,139
So I go with high
pressure through

458
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:55,899
a turbine, okay?
All right.

459
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:58,099
And then I come back down,

460
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:07,180
and I do the same
thing with my turbine.

461
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,779
Here's my W dot
out from it.

462
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,180
And you have this
heat exchanger.

463
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,179
You have a heat
exchanger, which is here.

464
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:23,299
So four, three,
two, one. Okay?

465
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,379
If you were trying to

466
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:26,580
get so I guess

467
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,740
the question is,
what's the goal?

468
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,979
So what is the goal of
a process like this?

469
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,649
What is this?

470
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:41,369
It's a turbine. What
does a turbine do?

471
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,730
Workout. It's useful.

472
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,649
You know, it creates work.

473
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,369
What do you think is
going to happen if I put

474
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:52,929
a heat exchanger and I

475
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,529
cool off the gas 3-2 here?

476
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,009
What do you think is
going to happen to

477
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:01,370
the performance of
this second turbine?

478
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,690
So let's think simpler.

479
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,489
And let's open
up to the crowd.

480
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,370
What is the formula that I

481
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,249
just showed you a couple

482
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:11,489
of slides before for work?

483
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,689
Work is equal to the
integral of what here?

484
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,129
Okay, one at one.

485
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,810
Or one all at once.

486
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,410
Like go bears.

487
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,449
Yes, please. No.

488
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,669
VDP PDV is expansion
work, right?

489
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,429
This is a constant
volume, right?

490
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,670
This is constant volume.

491
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,830
Okay. So to get work
out of something

492
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,990
that's constant volume,

493
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,829
it's VDP for steady
flow, right?

494
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:47,029
So you have V
DP there, okay?

495
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,749
So this is the thing

496
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:48,629
I want to have
in your mind.

497
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:50,309
So now I go from
state three,

498
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,189
and I cool it down
to state two.

499
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:58,549
What is going to happen
to the workout of

500
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,629
that turbine if I

501
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:04,429
cool down from State
three to State two?

502
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,219
Phone a friend.

503
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:17,659
Please. It's
going to go down.

504
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,140
Why? But I don't

505
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,459
have temperature
in this formula.

506
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,379
I liked it. I liked
where you were going.

507
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,259
Anyone want to pick up

508
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,859
the baton in front of you?

509
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,660
No, no, pause. Sorry.

510
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,179
You're decreasing
pressure.

511
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,139
So if you basically
take heat out here,

512
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:49,019
if I do a Q out here,

513
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,099
then the P two is going
to go down, okay?

514
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:54,059
Which means like pinwheel,

515
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:55,499
right, it's less pressure.

516
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,059
You're going to have

517
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,659
less pressure to
push on that device,

518
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,379
and you're going to get
less workout, okay?

519
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,939
So if you ran
that in reverse,

520
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,899
you'd get fired, okay?

521
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:05,619
However, let's think
the other way.

522
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:06,660
What would you
actually do?

523
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,739
So if I gave you
that system there,

524
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:11,579
what is an intelligent
thing you could do?

525
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,099
A turbine. Say it again.

526
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,740
You can use it to
stop a turbine.

527
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,699
Stop a turbine.
You could do.

528
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:22,700
Sure. You're also
out of a job.

529
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,059
Add heat. That's it.

530
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,940
So basically, you
can add heat.

531
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,499
You can do a Q in here,

532
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:29,579
and that's done
later, right?

533
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,420
So we'll call this reheat.

534
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,579
So sometimes this will
be called reheat.

535
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,339
Or let's think about this.

536
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:37,019
Maybe you decide
you want to take

537
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,419
the exhaust gases out

538
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,780
of this and
something like that.

539
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,060
That's called
regeneration.

540
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,584
And we're going to get
into this later, okay?

541
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,790
So you're going
to do things to

542
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,269
extract, okay? All right.

543
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,669
So it was a good idea.

544
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,149
Like all things, you know,

545
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:54,350
we started off a
little bit kind

546
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,629
of as a nice question,

547
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:57,829
but there is something
to it. Yes, please?

548
00:23:57,829 --> 00:23:59,989
Okay. So how would

549
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:02,069
the two stage with
the heat extender in

550
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:04,349
the middle of it
be different than

551
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:05,749
a single stage where

552
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:07,549
it loses heat
during the process?

553
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:09,630
So, you want to
do the cooling.

554
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,110
Basically, you
want to cool

555
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,309
the compressor while you

556
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,755
do it. It's possible.

557
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:18,759
The point of that is
that then I can't come

558
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,319
up to the whiteboard
here and do it

559
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,199
in a very elegant way
like I've done, right?

560
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,719
So I take it and
I break it down.

561
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:25,480
I can do one
stop isotropic,

562
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,360
right, where I don't deal

563
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,280
with the heat additions,

564
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,599
and I can do
it reversibly,

565
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,879
and then the next
one where I'm taking

566
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:33,640
heat out while it happens.

567
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,679
We have cycles that are

568
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:35,879
coming where we're
going to do that,

569
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,319
but it's not today, okay?

570
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,239
But it is a fair
question, all right?

571
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:44,229
Yes, please.
Temperature So

572
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:45,709
this is I believe you guys

573
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:46,949
are saying the
same thing, right?

574
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:48,349
So he's basically saying,

575
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:50,589
I will take the heat
out of it to keep it

576
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,949
cool while I'm operating,
is what I got.

577
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:55,989
Or did I misunderstand?

578
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:57,750
I'm looking at the graph

579
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,549
instead of just
going straight up.

580
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,520
Is that would you
say that that's

581
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,279
a similar thought to
what you had or no?

582
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,039
So what he's basically
saying is while

583
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,039
I'm doing this,
I'm also cooling.

584
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,639
So while I'm putting
the work in,

585
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm basically
taking the heat

586
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,079
out while it
happens, okay?

587
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,919
All right. But as you can

588
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,919
imagine in this
analysis, right?

589
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,519
Like, I want to be
able to say that

590
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,519
this thing operates
reversibly,

591
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,320
okay? So at optimum.

592
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,560
To be able to use my
entropy being constant,

593
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,719
I have to treat that
adiabatically, right?

594
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:33,799
So it needs to be

595
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,680
an adiabatic process
to get to get to that.

596
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,229
I Right.

597
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:42,109
And then we go down.

598
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,149
I think what
you're saying is

599
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:45,470
essentially to keep it
flat in this analysis,

600
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,589
it would be like
an infinite series

601
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,309
of compressors
in a row with,

602
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:52,270
like, little bits
a little bits

603
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,549
of heat taken out, okay?

604
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:54,669
And we're going
to do this.

605
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:55,789
We're basically
going to get into

606
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:57,389
cycles and
analysis like that

607
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,149
later that build on
these two thoughts.

608
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:00,390
These are two very
nice thoughts,

609
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,509
actually we have, okay?

610
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,949
All right. Other
questions?

611
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,749
Other nice
thoughts. This side

612
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:08,949
of the room is
crushing it.

613
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:10,790
You guys, you just
saving for later.

614
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,309
Okay, that's good.
All right. All right.

615
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,189
So if there's not, then
what I'm going to do,

616
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:19,549
I'll is that
recording on that?

617
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,309
Let me erase and then we

618
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:24,270
can dive into some
entropy analysis.

619
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:06,960
All right. Okay,
entropy balance.

620
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,279
Like, why would
we do this?

621
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:13,279
So, the reason why
we're going to get into

622
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,199
this is because sometimes

623
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,159
entropy is easier,
all right?

624
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,079
And okay.

625
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,639
So we end the
first law, right?

626
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,039
The first law
basically says, like,

627
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,399
heat and work are
the same, right?

628
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,879
They're equivalent.
Delta U

629
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,360
is Q minus W, right?

630
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,519
The second law tells

631
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,679
you that they are
not, all right?

632
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,800
There's all
kinds of energy.

633
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,599
It's very weird.

634
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,039
We don't fully
understand it.

635
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,719
Um, But

636
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,759
entropy is something
we do understand,

637
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,959
one, and two, we can use

638
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:43,919
it to kind of make

639
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,319
these things
equivalent, right?

640
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,119
When we're dealing with

641
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,679
work in heat interactions,

642
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,000
we're going to be
able to draw the same

643
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,319
control volumes
that we did

644
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,400
before and only deal

645
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,319
with entropy there, right?

646
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,999
It's a property.
That's a nice thing.

647
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,920
So we can talk about
the fluid streams.

648
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
We've got a nice
formula for heat,

649
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,719
and we say that for work

650
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:03,239
transfer processes
that are reversible,

651
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,920
there is no change
in entropy, right?

652
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,440
So from the beginning,

653
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,679
it seems like
we're on a more

654
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,560
firm firm basis, right?

655
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,309
Yeah, so it's It

656
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,789
doesn't exist in
various forms.

657
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:16,589
It's equally confusing
to all, right?

658
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:18,190
It's a nice thing, right?

659
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,750
And the way we're going
to do the balance,

660
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,390
the only
difference between

661
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,829
this and what
we had before,

662
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,269
we'll start off
the same, right?

663
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,070
So we're going to have

664
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,109
a change in the entropy

665
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:28,109
of some control
volume that we draw.

666
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:31,509
That's equal to the
amount we bring in, okay,

667
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,230
total entropy
entering minus

668
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,069
the total that leaves.

669
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:37,989
And then we have
one other term

670
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:39,669
which is generated, right?

671
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:43,270
What's an example of
entropy generation?

672
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,190
Kai? Something that
generates heat.

673
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,430
Could be. Friction, right?

674
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,350
So you can have
something that's

675
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,389
happened and
it's friction,

676
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,909
maybe, you know,

677
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:52,389
the compressor
and stuff before.

678
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:53,869
That's exactly it, right?

679
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,949
So it is something that

680
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:57,190
can be generated, right?

681
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,949
So that's really the
only additional thing

682
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:01,709
conceptually to
this balance

683
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:02,629
compared to what we had

684
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:03,750
from the energy before,

685
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,029
is that it can be

686
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:07,790
generated within
the control volume.

687
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,669
Alright? And you remember

688
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:17,109
before when I said, Okay,

689
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:18,870
whether or not to
know if something's

690
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,869
a work transfer process

691
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,349
or a heat
transfer process,

692
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:22,429
what did I say to you

693
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,510
before was like the rule?

694
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:30,300
How did you know the
difference? Temperature.

695
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,020
If there was a difference
in temperature,

696
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,259
right,

697
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:34,420
it was heat transfer,
and if there wasn't,

698
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,180
then it was work transfer.

699
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,139
Here, we'll give
you another one.

700
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:40,620
If you have an
energy interaction

701
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,020
accompanied by
entropy transfer,

702
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,220
that's going to
be heat transfer.

703
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,700
If you have an
energy interaction

704
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,060
that's not accompanied

705
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,259
by entropy transfer,
it's work, right?

706
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,980
So again, think about
that work interaction

707
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,899
before, the
turbine, Iropic?

708
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:59,460
I do this, and I have
no change in entropy.

709
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,099
Work, okay? I
do this thing,

710
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,659
and I have that
massive line.

711
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,859
Remember that line
before, which was here,

712
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:07,499
right? So then I
have this one.

713
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:08,420
Heat.

714
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,499
Heat work.

715
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:12,699
Okay. Bless you.

716
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,699
All right.

717
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,459
Cool.

718
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,619
Um, yeah, so the
mechanisms, again,

719
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,299
if we come back to

720
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,060
that smaller
control volume

721
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,139
where I'm not
bringing any mass in,

722
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:34,979
you're going to
be transferring

723
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:37,259
in entropy here
with heat, right?

724
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,779
So I have some Q, right?

725
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,060
You know, if it's a
constant temperature,

726
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,780
so if I'm transferring

727
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,020
into or out of
a reservoir,

728
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,539
thermal reservoir,
you know,

729
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:50,739
you're going to be
able to write that.

730
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:51,979
If it's not, then you

731
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:53,060
need to be able to relate

732
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,740
changes in heat to
temperature, right?

733
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,299
We did that before
with things

734
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,139
like with sensible
heating, right?

735
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:01,819
What was, like,
one formula we had

736
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,300
for relating

737
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,259
heat heat transfer
to temperature?

738
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,259
MCP Delta T, right?

739
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,059
So we basically had

740
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:11,859
something like
that, you know,

741
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:14,380
for the solids and
for the liquids,

742
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,779
that's a common way
to deal with that.

743
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,179
As we also saw from

744
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,459
before when we
did it in class,

745
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,219
I think some people had

746
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:23,859
just taken a guess
and said, Okay,

747
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,419
what if I just do
the heat divided by

748
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:26,380
the temperature and it

749
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,659
turned off that was off.

750
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,060
It was only off by like
10% for the purposes

751
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,619
of that, you know,
analysis, okay?

752
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:35,100
So this is the
way that entropy

753
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,459
can be transferred
into a closed system.

754
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:40,699
If it's an open
system, right,

755
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,614
in addition to
that mechanism,

756
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:44,009
a fluid, right?

757
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:45,329
So I can have a fluid and

758
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,889
the fluid can carry
entropy in, right?

759
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:51,489
So again, in the original
energy analysis,

760
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,729
right, I could bring
energy in by work.

761
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:55,890
I could bring it by heat,

762
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,169
and I could bring it
in by mass, all right?

763
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,089
In entropy, I cannot

764
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:02,409
bring it in by work, okay?

765
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:04,049
I'm bringing
it in by heat,

766
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,449
and I am bringing it in by

767
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:08,249
mass that can
be brought in.

768
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,069
Okay. And because it's

769
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:13,629
a property, it's
convenient, right?

770
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:14,869
I can just say
I have this M

771
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,389
dot fluid stream in.

772
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:18,429
I know the state of it,
I know the entropy.

773
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:21,229
So I have, you know,
M dot as in, okay?

774
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:24,629
Cool. Yes, so then

775
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:25,789
you do some
balances, right?

776
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:26,949
So here's an example,
then, right?

777
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:28,189
We have a single
stream in,

778
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:29,909
single stream
out. All right.

779
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:31,309
So you want to look
at, let's say,

780
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:32,669
the change in the entropy,

781
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:33,790
that control volume.

782
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,309
I can do the heat in.

783
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:37,870
I have the
entropy by mass,

784
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,749
and of course, I can

785
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,109
also have
generation, okay?

786
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:42,679
Um what's a way

787
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:44,719
that I can have generation
inside of this?

788
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,640
We'll do this with
a heat exchanger.

789
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,920
But anything that happens,

790
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,919
right, like, let's say,

791
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:50,279
irreversibly inside of

792
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,000
that container could
be generation.

793
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,999
We said friction,
heat transfer.

794
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:57,320
It could also be
mixing, right?

795
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,119
So if you think about

796
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,439
mixing as a
process, right,

797
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,999
you can have
changes in entropy

798
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:04,840
from from mixing.

799
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,759
Okay?

800
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,839
Yeah. So if you get
into the steady state,

801
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,080
so this is non ate form,

802
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,560
again, just like we did
before in ate form.

803
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,839
A lot of times in
these analysis here,

804
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,239
we'll do it, you
know, for a second.

805
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:19,959
But, so the rate of change

806
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:24,750
of um And so we'll
see the rate

807
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,750
of change of entropy

808
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,230
in my control
volume dt is equal

809
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:38,229
to.in minus dot out plus
dot gen, all right?

810
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:39,390
If we assume it's

811
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,469
a steady process, this
is going to go away.

812
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:44,309
And so what you'll have
is that dot gen is

813
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:47,589
equal to dot out minus.in.

814
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:48,429
And this is going to be

815
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:50,069
a very common formula
for us, right,

816
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,749
that we're going
to use to then

817
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:54,299
understand this
generation, all right?

818
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,049
Alright, I got 7 minutes.

819
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:56,809
I think I can do it.

820
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,529
Alright. I'll leave
that one there.

821
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:00,369
So in this problem,
we're looking

822
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:02,250
at a heat exchanger.

823
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,569
Heat exchangers are
very important.

824
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:07,090
And this is I think

825
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,249
it's mimicking a
shower, if I remember.

826
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,170
Singles are some
funny examples.

827
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,009
So here we're bringing
in cold water

828
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:16,289
into this heat
exchanger at

829
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:17,650
this temperature
and conditions,

830
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,650
and it's exiting.

831
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,929
Now we're bringing
hot water

832
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,129
in from this side,

833
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:23,369
and it's exiting here.

834
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:28,889
We know, right,
the Delta Ts here.

835
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,109
So, um, Presumably
because we know,

836
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,549
let's say,

837
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,069
the phase of this
water that's here,

838
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:37,389
probably we could if

839
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,189
we assumed a
pressure of this,

840
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:40,669
let's say, like
1 atmosphere,

841
00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:41,909
I'd be able to
know the enthalpy

842
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,669
in and the enthalpy out.

843
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:46,469
Or, and this is
what we'll also do.

844
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:48,909
We can rely on the
fact that changes in

845
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,029
enthalpy for sensible
heating DH is CPET.

846
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:54,749
We can also try
this on for size.

847
00:34:54,749 --> 00:34:56,109
And in this
example, you get to

848
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:57,669
compare values
you get from

849
00:34:57,669 --> 00:34:59,029
the property
tables or from

850
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:01,834
Picor against what
you could have from,

851
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:05,079
um, from from
this analysis.

852
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,359
Alright, and the take home

853
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,799
message out of this
is because I know

854
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:09,559
the inlet and I
know the outlet of

855
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,559
this in those states and

856
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,680
end of the mass florid,

857
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,479
I'm going to know the
heat leaving, okay?

858
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,079
The key insight
is the heat

859
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,639
leaving or the heat

860
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,410
entering into
the cold stream.

861
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,020
For this heat exchanger,

862
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,659
a lot of times

863
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,420
the heat exchangs
they're very insulated,

864
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,699
so there's no
heat transfer in

865
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:26,259
or out of them
on the outside.

866
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:28,979
But internally,
the heat that

867
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:30,620
goes into the
cold water must

868
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,059
come from the
hot water, okay?

869
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:33,059
And so from that,

870
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:34,379
you're going to be
able to determine,

871
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:38,939
then the rest of

872
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:41,659
the information basically
the exit state here

873
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:42,859
because you know
the mass flow

874
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:45,379
rate of that, okay?

875
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,980
Let's do it. Alright.

876
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,699
So I am not going to well,

877
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:52,100
I guess what I'll
redraw is I'll redraw

878
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,789
the control volumes there.

879
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,159
And so we can answer
the first question.

880
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:58,999
So the first question is

881
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,080
the rate of heat transfer.

882
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,040
This is pretty trivial.

883
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,919
So what we'll do there

884
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:04,079
is we'll just
take the water.

885
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,439
So I have this
water stream here,

886
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:08,799
which is going in and out.

887
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,159
Okay? I'm going to

888
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,759
draw my control
volume around that.

889
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,679
So I'll draw that
control volume around

890
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,040
the cold water streams

891
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,679
of the blue one up there.

892
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,719
I'm going to call
this is State one,

893
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,879
and I'm going to call this

894
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,639
is state two, okay?

895
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,359
I have the MDOT.

896
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,679
Let's call it
MDOT cold here,

897
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,710
which is also, known.

898
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,270
And for this
control volume,

899
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,109
all we can say is that

900
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,029
there's going to
be maybe like

901
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:36,829
aq.in that is
happening, okay?

902
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:40,869
So it's a steady flow,
no work interaction.

903
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:43,909
And so this q.in is
going to be equal to

904
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:46,110
the dot code times

905
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,589
the enthalpy at state two

906
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:50,109
minus the enthalpy at
state one, all right?

907
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:51,909
And we can
approximate this

908
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,910
as saying because it
doesn't change phase,

909
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,669
we can say dot code is

910
00:36:55,669 --> 00:37:00,629
CP two minus
one, all right?

911
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,859
If we do it this way
or let's say this.

912
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:09,739
If I do it this way to

913
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:14,499
the MDOT cold is what
0.95 kilograms/second.

914
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,819
What's the specific
heat of water?

915
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:23,659
4.18 kilojoules per
kilogram Kelvin, right?

916
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,059
And our Delta T is what?

917
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:28,420
It's 80 70, 70 degrees

918
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,660
C minus ten degrees

919
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,419
C. All right. And
you'll get a number.

920
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:38,319
The number that I
have for this is 238.

921
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:42,619
238.3 kilowatts, okay.

922
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:44,499
If on the other hand,
you want to give

923
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:46,220
it a go with something
like Pi killer,

924
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,339
you know, this
is, you know,

925
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,739
water that's coming
in from the house.

926
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:50,619
You could take a
guess and say, Okay,

927
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:54,699
maybe this P one here
is maybe like 100 kPa,

928
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:57,339
you know, something
like an atmosphere.

929
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:58,460
It's a heat exchanger,

930
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,499
so P two is
equal to P one.

931
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:02,859
And from that, you could
do a substitution.

932
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:03,939
You could figure out what

933
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:06,179
those enthalpies are
from that state.

934
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:08,139
And the number
that you'll get

935
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:14,969
is 238.5 kilowatts, okay?

936
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:17,249
So single phase water
and bringing heat

937
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:20,529
in dot Cp delta
T. Cp Delta T,

938
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:21,849
not too shabby, not

939
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,409
too shabby, and
very fast, okay?

940
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:24,289
Someone even knew that

941
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:25,169
off the top of their head.

942
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,529
They knew the C, they
knew the Delta T,

943
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:30,329
and you got a value
that's good for almost

944
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:33,249
to the fourth
decimal, all right?

945
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:36,249
Fourth a significant
figure. All right?

946
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:39,289
Okay. So that's the
heat transferred in.

947
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:41,489
So this is Q dot N.

948
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:45,129
That's wonderful.
All right.

949
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:49,809
To do this analysis,
though, right?

950
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:55,329
So to be able to get to
the entropy, though.

951
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:56,369
So for the cute item,

952
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:57,570
this is perfectly
acceptable.

953
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,969
But if I want to
determine things

954
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,089
like entropy here,

955
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:01,729
I will have to

956
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:03,889
declare the
temperature, right?

957
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:05,889
So I knew the
temperature was a value.

958
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:07,930
I knew that I'll
assume a pressure,

959
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,969
and out of this, I'll
get to an S one.

960
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,289
We also got to an
H one this way.

961
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,329
And for the case
here, right,

962
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:16,169
so the T two was
also a given.

963
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:17,409
If I have that pressure,

964
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:18,809
I can also get to an S.

965
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:21,449
I can also get
to an S two.

966
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:31,289
All right. All right,

967
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:33,610
so now we can deal
with the other stream,

968
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,649
which is basically
the hot water.

969
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:36,129
So here's the hot water.

970
00:39:36,129 --> 00:39:36,889
Okay.

971
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:39,529
Here's my control volume
for the hot water.

972
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:41,849
Let's say this is
state three here.

973
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,489
This is state four here.

974
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:47,729
I've got an M dot hot
that's coming in.

975
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:49,569
I'm given a temperature

976
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:51,769
of 85 degrees Celsius,

977
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:53,090
and I'm given the M dot.

978
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,689
And we know that
there's a Q dot

979
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:56,130
out from it that's

980
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,089
then heating the
water, right?

981
00:39:57,089 --> 00:39:59,169
So Q dot out
is going to be

982
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:01,769
equal to M dot hot times

983
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:07,129
H three minus H four.

984
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:10,529
Q dot out is
equal to q.in,

985
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,569
which is what
we had before.

986
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:18,630
So that's the
238238, kilowatts.

987
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,549
The dot hot is a given.

988
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:23,189
H three, we could get.

989
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:25,189
So if I say 85
degrees C, again,

990
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,709
let's just hazard
a guess and call

991
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:29,989
it like 100 kPa.

992
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:32,429
With that information,
so with P three

993
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:35,830
known and with
T three known,

994
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,069
I'm going to be
able to know what

995
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,749
I know what H three
is an S three.

996
00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:44,069
So I know H three,
I know the M dot,

997
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:46,629
I know the Q dot,
and now I know H,

998
00:40:46,629 --> 00:40:48,669
but I know H four, okay?

999
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:52,069
And the point is for
state four, All right,

1000
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:53,709
so for state four, if I

1001
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,629
know H four that's
there, and again,

1002
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:58,029
if I say P four is
equal to P three,

1003
00:40:58,029 --> 00:40:59,909
I'm going to be
able to say that I

1004
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:04,709
know what S four is, okay?

1005
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,910
And the take home message,

1006
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,309
did I get rid of it?

1007
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:09,789
I got rid of it.

1008
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:12,749
The take home message
from this, though,

1009
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:15,549
is that essentially
the dot gen that

1010
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:18,820
I wrote before is
going to be dot cold.

1011
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,409
Times S two
minus one plus m

1012
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:28,689
dot hot times S four
minus S three, okay?

1013
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:33,009
With that, I'll
close there.

1014
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,089
We'll get more into
this and more practice,

1015
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:37,609
you know, with some time,

1016
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:39,049
but at least as
a starter into

1017
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:42,769
some entropy
analysis, okay?
