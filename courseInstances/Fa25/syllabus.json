  [cite_start]"course_description": "This course introduces the scientific principles that deal with energy conversion among different forms, such as heat, work, internal, electrical, and chemical energy. The physical science of heat and temperature, and their relations to energy and work, are analyzed on the basis of the fundamental thermodynamic laws. These principles are applied to various practical systems, including heat engines, refrigeration cycles, and air conditioning systems. [cite: 159, 160, 161]",
