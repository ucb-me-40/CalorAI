      "summary": "Starts by applying the **Entropy Balance** to a closed system: $$\\Delta S_{\\\\text{system}} = \\\\sum \\\\frac{Q_k}{T_k} + S_{\\\\text{gen}}$$. This equation equates the change in system entropy to the sum of entropy transfer (via heat) and entropy generation ($$S_{\\\\text{gen}}$$) due to irreversibilities.",

The **entropy generation** term is always $$\\ge 0$$. $S_{\\\\text{gen}} > 0$$ indicates an **irreversible process** (real-world), $S_{\\\\text{gen}} = 0$$ indicates a **reversible process** (idealized), and $S_{\\\\text{gen}} < 0$$ indicates an **impossible process**.",

Since $Q=0$$ for an isolated system, $$\\Delta S_{\\\\text{universe}} = S_{\\\\text{gen}}$$. This leads back to the **Increase of Entropy Principle**: $$\\Delta S_{\\\\text{universe}} \\\\ge 0$$.",
