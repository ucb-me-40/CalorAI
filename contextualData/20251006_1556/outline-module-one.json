It is the parameter that dictates the temperature response of a system to a given heat transfer. The concept is illustrated by comparing materials like iron and water: for the same amount of heat transferred, water's temperature rises minimally compared to iron's, demonstrating water's **high specific heat capacity** and its ability to store a large amount of energy. Specific heat is shown to be non-constant, varying based on the **nature of the substance** and the molecular **modes of energy storage**. The lecture notes that substances with more available molecular modes (e.g., rotational and vibrational modes) generally exhibit a higher specific heat. Finally, the lecture introduces two types of specific heat, which are especially relevant for gases, as the heat transferred depends on the process path: **Specific Heat at Constant Volume ($c_v$)** for isochoric processes (e.g., in an automobile engine) and **Specific Heat at Constant Pressure ($c_p$)**. The core mathematical relationship is given by $Q = m c \\Delta T$.",

The first experiment involved a paddle wheel spinning in water, powered by a dropping weight, with a thermometer recording the temperature rise, directly linking mechanical work input to a heat equivalent. The second, more complex experiment involved two bulbs connected by a valve and submerged in a liquid bath: one bulb contained high-pressure air, and the other was evacuated. Upon opening the valve, the air underwent free expansion into the vacuum. By treating the two-bulb system and the bath as a control volume, and observing that there was no significant temperature change in the bath, Joule was able to conclude that the internal energy of the gas is not a function of volume or pressure, only temperature ($U=U(T)$).",

For engineering applications, especially over a small temperature range, the $\\Delta U$ equation is often simplified using an average specific heat value ($c_{v,avg}$) as $\\Delta U = c_{v,avg} \\Delta T$. Similarly, the **enthalpy** ($H$) of an ideal gas is also temperature-dependent only, and its change ($\\Delta H$) is calculated using the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$): $\\Delta H = \\int m c_p(T) dT$ (or $\\Delta H = m c_{p,avg} \\Delta T$ using the average specific heat approximation).

This expansion causes a temperature decrease, known as the **Joule-Thompson effect**. The process is visualized on a **pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram**, where a saturated liquid at high pressure ($x=0$) expands along a constant enthalpy line into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture at lower pressure.",
