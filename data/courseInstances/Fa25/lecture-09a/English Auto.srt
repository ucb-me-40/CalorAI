1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Nine. Okay. Lecture nine.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,400
All right. So today
we're going to talk

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,240
about gas power cycles.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,640
There's an
important moment

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,320
in this class where like

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,170
rubber road.
You know, here.

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,610
Okay. So after today,

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,890
you're going to be
able to evaluate

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,489
the performance of
a gas power cycle,

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,009
describe or develop

11
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,450
some simplifying
assumption

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,889
that's going to
make life easier,

13
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:26,089
and we'll solve a

14
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:27,330
problem based on
the auto cycle.

15
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,849
And if we have time,
we'll also go through

16
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:31,489
the diesel cycle, okay?

17
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,610
Okay, so power cycles.

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,850
Classify in two ways.

19
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,129
The first is what's
called a gas cycle.

20
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:41,529
Through the whole cycle,

21
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:44,090
the fluid is a gas,

22
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,649
a vapor cycle, um,

23
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,129
is a process where the

24
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:50,809
working fluid is a vapor,

25
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,689
but it also
condenses, okay?

26
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,609
So it is not a gas the
whole time, right?

27
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:55,849
There's a liquid.

28
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:59,049
The most famous one
of this, right?

29
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:02,130
So we have auto,
which is this diesel,

30
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,930
and for the aero people
in the room, Brayton.

31
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,089
Brayton is a very
important one there.

32
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:08,650
On this vapor cycle,

33
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,489
the most important
one is Rankin, okay?

34
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:11,689
This is how we
make most of

35
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,379
our energy
globally, is that.

36
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:17,549
Okay. If we focus just on

37
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,750
the gas power
cycle examples,

38
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,950
we have cycles that
run on closed systems,

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,549
and we have cycles that

40
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:29,229
run on control
volumes, all right?

41
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:32,070
So closed system means
piston cylinders.

42
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,230
So all those piston

43
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,549
examples that
I did for you,

44
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,189
it wasn't just for your
health, all right?

45
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:36,989
This is for, you know,

46
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:38,669
these applications
and done.

47
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:40,830
And the auto cycle
and the diesel cycle

48
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,310
run on piston
cylinder devices,

49
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,750
which we can do energy

50
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,429
analysis on from
the closed system.

51
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:48,709
So that's Chapter
four material.

52
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:54,980
For a for things like
the Brayton cycle,

53
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,019
which is a steady
flow device, right,

54
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,459
that consists
of compressors,

55
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,540
heat exchangers,
and the turbine.

56
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,060
There we do control
volume analysis,

57
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,619
all right?

58
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:08,579
And we will apply for
the closed system,

59
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:10,140
right, the different
analyses of

60
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,860
the different
states of this.

61
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,100
And for this
one, we'll do it

62
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,820
for the different
components, all right?

63
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,739
But again, those
fundamentals

64
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,580
we did for, you know,

65
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,539
Module one are not
going to be applied

66
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,870
into the Module
two here, okay?

67
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,999
So, what is the
auto cycle?

68
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,520
The auto cycle is

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,320
an idealized cycle for

70
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,919
how internal combustion
engines operate,

71
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,680
specifically ones that
are running gasoline,

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:33,920
right?

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,399
So gasoline
engines, they run

74
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,960
on what's called
the auto cycle.

75
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,899
Um, There's four there's

76
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,499
four steps in the process.

77
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:45,500
The first is that
you take, right,

78
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,100
your air and your fuel and

79
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,980
you compress this, okay?

80
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,460
Right? So you have this
compression process.

81
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,220
Then you ignite it,

82
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,980
and gasoline burns
very quickly, okay?

83
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,780
So this ignition
process happens so

84
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,220
fast that we consider

85
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,260
that as an isochoric step,

86
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,339
all right? Very fast.

87
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:08,989
Um, you have an expansion,

88
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,190
right, that happens
after that.

89
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,670
And then you have
exhaust and then intake,

90
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,750
and you start
again, right?

91
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,709
So this is the reality.

92
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,630
So the reality is
that Professor Suzi,

93
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,910
you told me that's
a closed system.

94
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,710
It looks an awful lot

95
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,869
like things are
coming in and out.

96
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,230
Yes. If we want
to analyze this

97
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,710
and idealize it and

98
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,270
make it more
straightforward to do,

99
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,990
what we can do is
we can say that

100
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,590
this compression process
is isotropic, okay?

101
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,150
The heat conditionion,

102
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,309
instead of dealing with

103
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:36,710
combustion and
saying, Okay,

104
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,269
that's a
complicated species

105
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,870
and enthalpy
of combustion,

106
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,709
that's going to be like,

107
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:41,589
you know, Module three.

108
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,310
We'll get to
enthalpy combustion.

109
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,660
For now, We'll
say that most

110
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,300
of what's in there is
actually nitrogen.

111
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,779
Nitrogen doesn't react.

112
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,220
Not very much anyways.

113
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,100
And so this fluid
is mostly air.

114
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,780
Thermodynamically,
it's air, okay?

115
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,580
And so we can

116
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,180
approximate the
combustion process

117
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,420
by a heat addition
heat addition, okay?

118
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,380
Then isotropic expansion,

119
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,859
and then isochoric
heat removal,

120
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,100
okay? So again,
the same thing.

121
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,180
We say, right, this is

122
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,059
mostly nitrogen,
not reactive.

123
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:13,460
This is pretty much
then air, and most

124
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,339
of the air is
nitrogen anyways.

125
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,540
And so this intake

126
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,739
stroke then and the

127
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,099
refreshing and getting
us back to the start,

128
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,979
we'll idealize them as
a cue out, all right?

129
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,579
This is what the
reality would look

130
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,540
like on a PV diagram.

131
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,219
And then this is
what the idealized

132
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,734
one is there, okay?

133
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:36,649
There's two other
terms that are here.

134
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,489
So it's well,

135
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:40,530
let me just describe it

136
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,690
and then I'll
give it a name.

137
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,409
What's important in
something like this,

138
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,769
a device like this is

139
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:46,970
that boundary work you're

140
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,889
going to do, all right?

141
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,929
That PDV, all right?

142
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:55,930
So the case when you
have the maximum volume,

143
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,129
that's called bottom
dead center, okay?

144
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,570
This is when this thing
is most expanded.

145
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,490
And then when it's
most compressed,

146
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,269
that's TDC top dead
center, all right?

147
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:08,369
Does that really matter?

148
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,929
I don't know, but
it's terminology.

149
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:11,409
So if you're, you know,

150
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:14,090
like cars, then that's
what that means.

151
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,369
But there is a
meaning in thermal

152
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:17,530
because then, essentially,

153
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,489
by knowing those
two, you know,

154
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:21,649
volumes there,

155
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,129
right, you can say
something about the work.

156
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,489
There's a final term
that's not listed here,

157
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:28,449
which is that if I have
that maximum volume,

158
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,529
which happens at the
bottom dead center

159
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:31,769
and the minimum volume,

160
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,529
which happens at the
top dead center,

161
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:35,249
the W net that happens out

162
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:37,450
of this device right,

163
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,730
is equal to the difference

164
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,049
in those volumes times

165
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,209
some mean effective
pressure MEP, okay?

166
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,050
Again, this is
informational.

167
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,730
You can read the
book, but that's

168
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,249
the meaning that's
the meaning of that.

169
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,999
All right. Cool. So again,

170
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:56,519
if we come back to
analyzing the ideal cycle.

171
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,119
So each of those
processes, again,

172
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,479
just restating it
now showing it

173
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,800
here is a TS diagram.

174
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,959
This process one to two is

175
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,520
an isotropic compression,

176
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,600
two to three constant
volume heat addition,

177
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,760
three to four
isentropic expansion,

178
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,680
and four to one constant

179
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,839
volume isochoric heat
heat rejection, right?

180
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,240
So what does it mean
then if I have isotropic

181
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,640
compression and
isotropic expansion,

182
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,839
what can you say
about that process?

183
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,999
Presley. It's reversible
and what else?

184
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,680
Is. Internally reversible.

185
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,919
And if there's
no change in

186
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,479
entropy, what else is
not happening, okay?

187
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,799
A. Adiabatic Adiabatic and

188
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,839
reversible is what we're

189
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,920
talking about here, right?

190
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,214
For the auto. For
the auto cycle.

191
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:44,390
Okay, so let's
get into it.

192
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,790
I'm going to derive. So in

193
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,749
this example, I'll
take you through.

194
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:50,510
I find in this case,
to do the math,

195
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,830
pairing the math and
the derivation of

196
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,829
the thermal
efficiency is done

197
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:55,709
best when I actually

198
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,389
solve a problem
here, all right?

199
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,310
So in this case,
what you're given is

200
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,709
an ideal a cycle that

201
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,589
has a compression
ratio of seven.

202
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,069
So this compression
ratio, what is that?

203
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,069
The compression
ratio is the ratio

204
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,349
of the volume
at state one,

205
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,029
okay, divided by the
volume at state two.

206
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:14,140
So the state
before I compress,

207
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,090
All right, and the
state after I compress.

208
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:16,889
So the state before it

209
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,169
compresses at state one,

210
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:19,449
so you have volume one.

211
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,570
And when you compress,

212
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,689
you go to the volume two.

213
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:22,609
And so R is then

214
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,889
the ratio of
those two things.

215
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,329
It's going to be
greater than one,

216
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:27,489
right, because
you're compressing.

217
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,729
So in our case,
this is equal

218
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,729
to seven. All right.

219
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,409
At the beginning of the
compression process,

220
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,129
we have this, right?

221
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,009
We're letting in, you
know, pretty much air

222
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:45,489
at state one, from
atmospheric conditions.

223
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,769
So we have P one,
which is equal to

224
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:53,729
90 kpa and T one,

225
00:07:53,729 --> 00:08:00,250
which is equal to
27 degrees Celsius.

226
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,090
And so what it means,

227
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,329
if this is a
pure substance,

228
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:02,569
right,

229
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,489
you'll have complete
information, right?

230
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,409
If you decide to
go that route.

231
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:07,729
We're also given what the

232
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,649
volume is at state one,

233
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:16,369
and we're told that
that's 0.004 meter cubes.

234
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,769
So four liters,
right? All right.

235
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,289
The T max. So
additional information

236
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,089
that we're given.
This is state one.

237
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,970
The T max that we're given

238
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,769
is that we have one,

239
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:37,610
one, two, seven
degrees C, do.

240
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,570
Yeah. And what
we're told to do

241
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,650
is to assume a
number of things.

242
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:53,969
But constant CP and
CV is one of them.

243
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:55,170
And so we want
to determine.

244
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,090
So we're going to

245
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:03,359
determine Q

246
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,600
out is the first thing.

247
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,560
W net out,

248
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,280
the thermal efficiency of

249
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,840
this engine and the mean
effective pressure.

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,400
All right. So we

251
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,980
can begin with Yeah.

252
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,880
Calling that
from step one,

253
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,839
we're going to compress.

254
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,200
This is basically
from state

255
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,880
one to state two.

256
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,960
We're going to do a
compression process here.

257
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,240
That's good. For this,
we have isotropic.

258
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,440
If we assume that
this is an ideal

259
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
if we assume that
this is an ideal gas,

260
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,160
what we can rely on is

261
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,079
basically our
TDS relations

262
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,720
that we have here.

263
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,320
If I say that I have
dS is equal to CV,

264
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,640
dt divided by T plus
specific gas constant,

265
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,040
um, dv divided
by V, right?

266
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,959
And I say it's isomropic?

267
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,000
This is going
to be to zero.

268
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,840
And so what we'll have
is a negative CV,

269
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,360
dt divided by T
is equal to R,

270
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,200
dv by V. We

271
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,160
can put this to the
other side, okay?

272
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,080
Negative, um, a
negative there.

273
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,479
All right? We
can integrate.

274
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,999
If we treat this
as a constant,

275
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:02,800
right, we can pull that
out of the integral.

276
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,360
And so what you'll
have here is then

277
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,700
a natural log of T two

278
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,460
divided by T one is equal

279
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,060
to the negative R CV,

280
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,980
natural log of V
two divided by a

281
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,620
little V two divided
by little V one there.

282
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,340
This is a natural log.

283
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,259
I can put this up
to the exponent.

284
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,820
I have a natural log

285
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,660
of little V two divided by

286
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,659
little V one to
the power of

287
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,019
negative R divided by CV.

288
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,500
If I take the exponential
of both sides.

289
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,020
What I can have is then T

290
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,740
two divided by T one,

291
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,539
is equal to little
V two divided by

292
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,220
little V one to the
negative R by CV.

293
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,459
What can we
recall? How can I

294
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,220
relate R to CPs and CVs?

295
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,499
You can remember that R is

296
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:58,180
equal to Cp minus CV.

297
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,539
You can also remember
that Kappa is

298
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,220
equal to Cp divided by CV.

299
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,820
And so if you put
that in there,

300
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,300
what you can say is that T

301
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,420
two is equal to T
one, all right?

302
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,900
We can get rid
of the negative,

303
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,855
so we can flip that and
write V one by V two.

304
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:20,370
Cp minus CV over
CV is nothing

305
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,650
but kappa minus or

306
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,930
let me think about
this for a second.

307
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,730
So it will be cp minus CV,

308
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,210
so that'd be Kappa
minus one there.

309
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,685
All right. Does
this look familiar?

310
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,279
We related properties,
when we treated

311
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,799
ideal gas, our
TDS relations.

312
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,600
We took our TDS relations.

313
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,080
We wanted to know
how we went from

314
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,760
one state to
another one, okay?

315
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,600
And a nice way
to do that is

316
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
we treat it as an
isotropic process.

317
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,479
So we set that ds to zero.

318
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,840
And with that,
we're able to

319
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,600
relate things like
temperature changes

320
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
to pressure changes or

321
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,640
temperature changes
to volume changes.

322
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,960
That's why we
did this, okay?

323
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,160
Because now you can say,

324
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,880
I know my initial
temperature.

325
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,999
I know the ratio,

326
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,960
my volume, okay,
that's there.

327
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,239
So this what did I say?

328
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:09,120
I said R is equal to what?

329
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,350
V one divided by V two,

330
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,940
This is a closed system,
no mass in or out.

331
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,260
So it's fair for me
to write or this

332
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,660
is within my rights
to write N, right?

333
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,580
Little V one, N,
little V two.

334
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,020
There's no mass in or out.

335
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,820
And so that R
is little V one

336
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,340
divided by little
V two, right?

337
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,460
So this is T one times

338
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,020
R to the kappa minus one.

339
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,859
So by knowing this
compression ratio,

340
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,540
by knowing the
adiabatic index

341
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,340
and my initial
temperature in Kelvin,

342
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,739
I can determine
my temperature

343
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,780
at state two, all right?

344
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,660
Good. All right.

345
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,480
Whew. All right.

346
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Cool. So we've done,

347
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,159
you know, and so for
this, I don't have to

348
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,240
do I'm not doing

349
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
an energy analysis
here, right?

350
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going with, you know,

351
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
assuming this is
ideal gas and

352
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,559
treating it as isotropic.

353
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,040
Let's go now to
two to three.

354
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,520
So states, two.

355
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,280
All right, let's
see. It was

356
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,399
compressed like
this. So I'm here.

357
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,319
This is two to
three is isochoric,

358
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,320
and I'm putting some Q in.

359
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
I'm putting Q
in, all right?

360
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,479
For this, I need to do

361
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,520
an energy analysis,
all right?

362
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,280
I'll draw my control
volume here. Okay.

363
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,560
And I'm going to
write my first law.

364
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,160
So my first law applied
to a closed system

365
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
is Delta E is
equal to what?

366
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,600
E in minus E out.

367
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,719
Now it's time for our
second assumption.

368
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,920
I'm going to say
that inside of that,

369
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,000
what assumption am
I going to make

370
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,279
about the energy
the change

371
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,359
in the energy that
control volume?

372
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,359
What are ways that
it can store energy?

373
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,319
Internal and what else?

374
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:01,800
Name. Say it again.

375
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,580
Okay. And your
answer volume.

376
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,540
There is no volume, right?

377
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
It's the isochork process.

378
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,300
Energy. That's it, right?

379
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,580
So what you have
here is Delta U plus

380
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,900
Delta K plus Delta P

381
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,100
is equal to the ways
that I can transfer in.

382
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,780
What are ways that I can
transfer energy into

383
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,899
this control volume for a

384
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:26,740
closed system for 400?

385
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,660
He didn't work, right?

386
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,740
So I have W plus Q in

387
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,220
minus W plus Q out, right?

388
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,140
It's an isochrk process.

389
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,060
What do we think happens
to the work terms?

390
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,350
Adios. All right.

391
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,990
So we don't have
work done here.

392
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,790
This is a heat
transfer in process.

393
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,190
I don't have any I don't
have any heat out.

394
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,630
I'm going to write down

395
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,229
on my sheet of
paper that I am

396
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:57,910
neglecting changes

397
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,710
in kinetic and
potential energy.

398
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,150
And so the change in

399
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,590
the internal
energy here is

400
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,390
equal to Q in, okay?

401
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,589
Good. Now, we assume

402
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,350
this is an ideal
gas, all right?

403
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,110
How do I relate changes in

404
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,350
internal energy to

405
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,950
temperature for
an ideal gas?

406
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:25,470
Right? MCV Delta T, okay?

407
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,269
I'm going to
assume I assume

408
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,589
constant specific
heats, too.

409
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:29,789
Over these
temperature changes,

410
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,750
I'm not going to have
a huge variation.

411
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,070
And we'll check
ourselves on that.

412
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,230
At the end of this,
I'll show you

413
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,110
the error associated
with treating this

414
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,629
as a constant
instead of getting

415
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,430
exact property values of

416
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,110
internal energy
because you

417
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,910
could also do that, right?

418
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,270
You could go in
and say, Well,

419
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,150
I'm going to do this.
I'll know the mass.

420
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,510
I'll look up my internal
energy at state two,

421
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,549
and I'll look
up my specific

422
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,590
internal energy
at state one.

423
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,390
What you'll see is
at the end of this,

424
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,870
the error is about 5% by

425
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,950
assuming that this value

426
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,270
was taken at state one,

427
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,949
so basically room
temperature.

428
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,750
All right, so my
delta U here.

429
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,150
Let's be precise
with this.

430
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,509
So U, um, sorry,

431
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:12,829
this is U three
minus U two.

432
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,949
So U three minus U two is

433
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:24,069
equal to N cv T
three minus T two.

434
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,429
Okay, we know T two.

435
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:28,429
We just determined it

436
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:30,269
there through
that process.

437
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,989
T three, what do
we think T three

438
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:36,109
is based on the
problem information?

439
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,499
So this is right,

440
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,299
State three is
after combustion.

441
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,700
Is this going to be
hot or cold? Kai?

442
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,380
Is it going to be equal to

443
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,619
T max? That's right.

444
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:54,779
T max, all right? There's
your T max there.

445
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,580
And in this
case, our T max,

446
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,924
I wrote as 1127.

447
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,629
One, one, two,

448
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:03,389
seven degrees
Celsius. All right.

449
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:04,909
So with this, I know

450
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:08,949
my heat addition,
which is good, okay?

451
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:11,429
By knowing how much heat,

452
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,109
that I'm adding, I

453
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:15,349
am halfway to being

454
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:16,789
able to determine
my network.

455
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:19,069
Why? Because network out

456
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,669
is equal to net heat in.

457
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,109
So by determining Q

458
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,590
out and Q in,
you know that.

459
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,229
That's much more
convenient, in my opinion,

460
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:29,269
doing it this than
getting into, you know,

461
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,789
into the weeds with
work transfer, okay?

462
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,509
Okay? You could
do it. What did

463
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:35,785
we say about the work
transfer process?

464
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:39,940
It's isentropic, which
means adiabatic.

465
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,179
Do I have relations for

466
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,579
pressure and volume
to do a PDV?

467
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,220
You do, okay? You have

468
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,460
an adiabatic expansion.

469
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,299
Now it's coming back.

470
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,579
This is useful,
all right? Good.

471
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,259
All right, so we're
good with this one.

472
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,739
So we know the T three.

473
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:57,180
What I would like
to do now I've

474
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,579
run out of space.
What can I kill?

475
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:00,859
I'll kill this. Okay.

476
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:03,059
Let's I'll keep
that there.

477
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,860
I'll move to the
middle board.

478
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,099
I'll block that out.

479
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,900
Let's go to the
middle board.

480
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,099
Can erase this?

481
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:23,049
Okay. All right.

482
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:26,690
And now we're
going 3-4, right?

483
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,850
Three to four, and
it's expansion.

484
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,609
So I start off
here at this.

485
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,449
Actually, I kind of

486
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:36,449
drew it upside
down, right?

487
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:37,809
So this is top
dead center.

488
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,369
Yeah. Okay.
Anyways, it's going

489
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:41,209
to move out here and

490
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:46,369
expand like that,
all right? Okay.

491
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,619
And remember, in
this process,

492
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:53,939
this is an adiabatic
and reversible process.

493
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,299
So what you can hazard

494
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,580
a guess is that
we'll end up

495
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,259
using our TDS relations
again, right?

496
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,099
So ds is CV,

497
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,739
dt divided by T plus R,

498
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:10,019
dv by V there.

499
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,299
This is gone, right,
because it's isentropic.

500
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,620
And so here,
we'll have CV,

501
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,739
dt divided by T is equal
to the negative of

502
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:23,739
R dv divided by
V. All right,

503
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:25,299
I can move this to
the other side,

504
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,419
CV I can integrate.

505
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:29,300
I can treat these as

506
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,539
like a constant
there, right?

507
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,699
And so what we'll
have here is

508
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:34,059
the natural log of T

509
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,379
four divided by T

510
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:40,619
three is equal to
negative R by CV,

511
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,299
natural log of V four,

512
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,179
little V four divided by

513
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,379
little V three, right?

514
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,979
The same drill. We can

515
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,419
make this an
exponent, right?

516
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:54,739
So I can write
negative R by CV here.

517
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,180
Move that up, takes

518
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,779
the exponential
of both sides.

519
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,210
All right.

520
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,969
And we have that. Now,
we have to remember.

521
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:08,529
So here at state four,

522
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:14,569
state three from state

523
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,410
two to state three
was isochoric.

524
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,929
So V two is equal
to V three, okay?

525
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:23,169
And V four to

526
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,329
V one is isochoric
heat removal.

527
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:27,729
And what that means
is that it's going

528
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,529
to be equal to V one.

529
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,249
And so what we
can do is we can

530
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,009
write swap this out,

531
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:34,969
and we can say
that it's V one

532
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:38,799
divided by V two,

533
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,390
And we can remember

534
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,749
then our definitions
for this.

535
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:43,869
This is going to
be in the end,

536
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,189
we have a negative
sign here.

537
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,709
So basically, I'll
leave it like this,

538
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:52,150
negative R by CV,

539
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,749
and then we'll clean
that up in a second.

540
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:57,349
The negative sign,
we can flip this.

541
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,949
So if I do the
negative sign,

542
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:01,829
that's V two
divided by V one,

543
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:05,309
R by CV, and this R

544
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,190
by CV is R is Cp minus CV.

545
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,549
So this will be V two by V

546
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:17,709
one to the Kappa
minus one.

547
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,819
All right. We'd prefer if

548
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:24,619
this was then put into
the compression ratio.

549
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:26,499
So remember, state two

550
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:28,459
is more compressed
than state one.

551
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:29,499
And so what this will

552
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:30,699
look like it will be one

553
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,420
over R to the Kappa

554
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:41,179
minus one will be T four
divided by T three,

555
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:44,299
which essentially
just means that T

556
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:49,539
four is equal to T three
to the one over R,

557
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,180
which is the
compression ratio,

558
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,379
Kappa minus one, right?

559
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,860
So now I've got,
State one was given.

560
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,339
State two I got
from TDS relations.

561
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,379
Temperature at state three

562
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:08,540
was given as the
maximum temperature.

563
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,740
And now assuming
isotropic expansion

564
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,100
and using TDS relations,

565
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,099
I now have T four.

566
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:17,499
And the final one
that I want to do is

567
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:20,780
this isochoric
heat removal.

568
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,219
So for that,
I'll move back

569
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,499
to the left hand side.

570
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:30,889
Okay. And now we're
going four to one.

571
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:38,199
Four to one, and this
is the expanded state.

572
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:42,759
So this is the
expanded state,

573
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,159
and now I have Q out,

574
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,119
and my control
volume looks

575
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:55,259
like this. All right.

576
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,979
So again,

577
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,539
first law applied
to a closed system.

578
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,659
The change in
the energy of

579
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:04,899
the control volume in

580
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:06,419
here is equal to

581
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,619
the energy that enters
minus what leaves.

582
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:09,699
The change in energy

583
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:10,739
of the control volume can

584
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:12,019
be changes in
internal energy,

585
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,019
kinetic or potential.

586
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,380
We neglect changes in

587
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,420
kinetic and
potential energy.

588
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,379
This is an
isochoric process,

589
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:20,500
so we don't have
work transfer.

590
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,099
It's a cooling process,
so I don't have Q in,

591
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,819
but I do have Q.

592
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:30,219
Q out. All right.

593
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:41,019
So Delta U is equal
to Q Cue out.

594
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:45,259
Cue out here. All right.

595
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:46,499
This is going to
be from state

596
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,739
four to state one.

597
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:51,819
All right. All right.

598
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:53,859
And then what I'm
going to have here

599
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,940
is that the change

600
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,019
in the internal
energy from

601
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:00,139
state four to state one is

602
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:01,339
equal to the mass inside

603
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:03,779
the piston
cylinder times the

604
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,419
CV times T four
minus T one,

605
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:09,939
where T four is warmer
than T one, right?

606
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:12,300
It's a cooling process.

607
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,179
And then we can
do it that way.

608
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,179
And this is, if we were

609
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:19,780
treating this as an
ideal gas assumption.

610
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,539
If you don't want to make

611
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:21,740
the ideal gas assumption,

612
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,859
knock your socks off,

613
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:27,480
then you got to determine
the internal energy

614
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,079
at state four and

615
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,359
the internal energy
at state one.

616
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:35,959
Okay? So now with
this, right, I know,

617
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:41,239
I have formulas for
my Q in and my Q out.

618
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:49,640
So Qn, Q in was
equal to M, CV,

619
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,079
T three minus T two,

620
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,480
my Q out was equal
to the mass,

621
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,149
CV, T four minus
T one, okay?

622
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:08,699
Let Center here.

623
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,579
Okay. So W net

624
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:25,169
is equal to Q
in minus Q out.

625
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:29,209
Remember this for a
cycle is a cycle here.

626
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:32,889
For a cycle, the
net work out.

627
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:38,249
Net work out is equal
to the net heat in.

628
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:41,609
So the Q minus the Q out.

629
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:47,729
And so we can
write CV The N

630
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:50,769
is three minus T two,

631
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:57,009
and the out is
four minus T one.

632
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,230
All right. Our efficiency,

633
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,229
so the efficiency then of

634
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:08,429
the cycle of any
thermal engine

635
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:13,190
is the W net
divided by Qn.

636
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:19,829
And so my W net
then is Cv times T

637
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:28,069
three minus two minus
T four minus T one,

638
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:38,789
and my Qn is Cv times
T three minus T two.

639
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:56,150
All right. Ms are
gone. This is gone.

640
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,829
And so what you
can do is you can

641
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:00,149
rewrite this as one

642
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:05,589
minus T four minus T one,

643
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:09,509
T three minus T two,

644
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:10,589
and then you can be a

645
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,469
little bit fancy
with this.

646
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:12,429
So right now, it's in

647
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:13,910
temperatures,
which is fine,

648
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,389
but we'd prefer to have

649
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:17,709
this as a function of R,

650
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,270
the compression ratio

651
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,110
and the adiabatic index,

652
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,949
which we are allowed
to do because

653
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:27,110
we're treating this
as an ideal gas,

654
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,989
and we use the
TDS relations,

655
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:32,270
where we can relay
basically ratios

656
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,750
of temperatures
to each other.

657
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,790
So for this, you
can do one minus

658
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:43,679
T one times T four by T

659
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,559
one minus one divided by T

660
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:55,319
two times T three
by T two minus one.

661
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,939
Okay. Let's think for

662
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,219
a second. Think
for a second.

663
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:06,219
So if we recall

664
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:10,259
the TDS relations
that we had here.

665
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:13,579
So we said that can
this be seen here.

666
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:16,500
Let me blow it up Foam

667
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,459
I have one TDS relation.

668
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:26,179
So here I have T four by T

669
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:29,939
three is equal to one

670
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:35,419
by R to the
Kappa minus one.

671
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,279
All right. I had
the other one,

672
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:45,159
which was then what
T two is equal to T

673
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:52,079
one times R to the
kappa minus one.

674
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,679
So if I rewrote this,

675
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,279
I could put it
as T one by T

676
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:04,379
two is equal to one
over R Kappa minus one.

677
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:07,000
This is one formula,

678
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,279
this is another.
Means they're equal.

679
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,599
The ratio then
of T four by T

680
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:21,359
three is equal to
T one by T two,

681
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:27,159
T one, what's wrong?

682
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:35,969
Is there a question? Okay.

683
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,329
Yeah,

684
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:43,130
so these things are
related to each other.

685
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,169
And so what you
can have in

686
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:45,649
the end is if
you put through

687
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:50,610
the whole derivation
on the substitution,

688
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:55,690
what you'll end up
with is the following.

689
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,890
So you can, as

690
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,409
usual, follow it all
the way to the end.

691
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,130
But if you put through
that substitution,

692
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,330
what you'll end up
with then is an Ea,

693
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:07,289
which is equal to one
minus one over R,

694
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:09,449
the compression ratio to

695
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:12,729
the Kappa minus one, okay?

696
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:14,289
And that's
interesting because

697
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,169
all I need to know
for this problem to

698
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,530
say what the
thermal efficiency

699
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,650
is of this auto cycle

700
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,129
is how much do
I squeeze it?

701
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,610
How much do I compress it?

702
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,570
And what is the adiabatic

703
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,890
index of my substance,

704
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,509
right, which in this
case is air, all right?

705
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:32,409
Cool. All right.

706
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:34,570
So if you go through
and you substitute

707
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,489
any substitute
values for this,

708
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:38,810
I'll spare you
the details.

709
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,449
But he rejected here for

710
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:43,530
this case is then
one kilojoule,

711
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,849
that's your network.
That's the efficiency.

712
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:48,010
And for the mean
effective pressure,

713
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,569
all you do is you take

714
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:51,049
this network and you

715
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,929
make it equal to the MEP,

716
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:56,769
you make it equal
to the network

717
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:58,529
out that I had there.

718
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,149
So your network out.

719
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:03,330
Is equal to the
max volume,

720
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,969
which is at state one
minus the mint volume,

721
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:07,329
which is at
state two times

722
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,090
the mean effective
pressure.

723
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,769
So you divide that
out and you'll end

724
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:13,289
up with the value, okay?

725
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:15,249
You can compare this with

726
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,449
the property
tables, right?

727
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:20,929
So I mentioned
here for Right,

728
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,049
the heat additions and
the heat removals,

729
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:26,529
you can work with, right,

730
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,290
the specific
internal energies.

731
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,049
How do you get to

732
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,009
the specific internal
energies there?

733
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,649
1-2. It's isotropic.

734
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:36,169
So I know my initial
state, okay?

735
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,089
I know how much
I'm compressing

736
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,930
it so I know my
specific volume,

737
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,609
and I know that the
entropy at state

738
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:43,449
two is equal to the
entropy at state one.

739
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:44,809
I've got two, okay?

740
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,809
2-3 now that I know two,

741
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:52,049
again, two to three is
an isochoric process.

742
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,049
So specific volume
at state three

743
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:56,209
is equal to the specific
volume at state two.

744
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,960
Good. So I know

745
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,199
the specific volume
is state three,

746
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,559
and another temperature
at state three,

747
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,160
because it was the
maximum temperature.

748
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,679
Good. Now, when
I go through

749
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,199
the expansion process
that's isentropic,

750
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:07,839
S four is equal to S one.

751
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,679
So that's good.

752
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,160
And the specific volume

753
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,240
at state four is equal to

754
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,399
the specific volume
at state one

755
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,640
because it's isochoric.

756
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,399
So you can round the
loop going that way.

757
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,040
That's also perfectly
acceptable.

758
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,559
And if you do
this alternative

759
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,280
solution, compute
the properties,

760
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,640
you know, call in the
internal energies

761
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,399
from Pi killer that way.

762
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,279
Um, what you'll get is

763
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,679
an efficiency that's
50.57 versus 54.

764
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,079
So if you want to
put that into, like,

765
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,839
error, the error
is about 7%.

766
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,280
The take home message too

767
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,999
long didn't read is
that you can write

768
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,560
this and have
an error that's

769
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,359
less than 10% based on

770
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,880
two things. Pretty
convenient.

771
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,559
Alright? Um, yeah.

772
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,569
And this is then how it

773
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:51,649
looks like in the diagram.

774
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:52,649
Just to remind
you all now,

775
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:53,569
this is getting
very important.

776
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,409
So in PICOor until now,

777
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:56,889
we've worked with
states, right?

778
00:33:56,889 --> 00:33:58,850
So we've used
the state class.

779
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,489
From here on out, process

780
00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:01,850
is going to be
important, right?

781
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,289
States, I expect.
You should be

782
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:05,010
able to do that
stuff in your sleep.

783
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,369
Yeah, in this notebook,
you can pull, right?

784
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:09,130
This is on the slides.

785
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,330
But to do that,
what you'll

786
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,569
do is you'll
define your state,

787
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:13,729
state one, state
two, all right?

788
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:15,209
That's one part
of a process,

789
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:18,294
two to three, three
to four, four to one.

790
00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:20,259
There's your process,
and then you can

791
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,939
make plots. You p dot.

792
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,219
PR, let's say, is

793
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,740
then the object
I've defined.

794
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,379
If I go dot plot PV,

795
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:28,260
I get a PV diagram, Ts,

796
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,660
I get a TS diagram,

797
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,739
and that's what
that looks like.

798
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,299
If states are very
close together,

799
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:33,740
then obviously
they overlap,

800
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,299
just like being in a
crowded restaurant,

801
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:37,939
you'll be on
top of someone.

802
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:40,419
It can happen here.

803
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:43,180
Sometimes you'll
know differences.

804
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,820
The book is a
little bit, um,

805
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,659
uh, like dolly in

806
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,499
the sense that it

807
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:52,939
doesn't give it
to you exactly.

808
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:55,859
It gives you, what,

809
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,739
you know, the
meaning of it.

810
00:34:57,739 --> 00:34:59,819
All right? Now, what I
mean to say is that,

811
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:00,980
like, this is exact.

812
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,219
So sometimes
you'll end up with

813
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:02,859
states that you really

814
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:03,539
can't see the difference.

815
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:05,500
If I take an
incompressible substance

816
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,219
and I apply a
Delta P to that,

817
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:08,699
there's not going to
be much change, right?

818
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:09,900
Those things are
going to overlap.

819
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,819
You'll see that
when we get

820
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,020
into the vapor cycle.

821
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,059
The book, on
the other hand,

822
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:14,939
exaggerates, right?

823
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:16,779
Big differences
between those points

824
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:17,619
because they want to drive

825
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:19,299
home the message of,

826
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:20,259
you know,

827
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:21,579
that something's
happening there, right?

828
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,219
But do this. Get
comfortable with this.

829
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:24,779
A very important part
of this class when you

830
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:27,339
leave is that you
can graph like that.

831
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:29,169
Thermo is

832
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,169
drawing boundaries
and graphing, right?

833
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:33,849
And if you can
represent these things

834
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:35,489
graphically, you really
know your stuff.

835
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:37,969
And this part of it
makes it I can't tell

836
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,549
you how much like,

837
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:41,789
how many lines of code, I

838
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:42,989
used to have to
write to do that.

839
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:44,349
Like, the fact that
you can do this,

840
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:44,989
you know, thank you,

841
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:47,549
Prossor Frank Locke
for doing this for us,

842
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:48,909
that you can do this in

843
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:50,149
such a
straightforward way.

844
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,350
It is also not trivial.

845
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,510
It is like graph theory.

846
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,669
So, you might
look at a plot

847
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:54,869
and say, I could be
a little bit better.

848
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,909
My response to you
is, then tell me how.

849
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:58,549
I will welcome that, okay?

850
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:00,550
But it is not trivial

851
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,310
to do that there, alright?

852
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,069
I don't know why you
chose the colors either,

853
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:05,709
which was like cowbo and
gold, but, you know,

854
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:08,229
maybe gold doesn't render
very well on that.

855
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:10,854
Okay. Are there
questions about this?

856
00:36:10,854 --> 00:36:13,719
So again, with
anything like this,

857
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,599
when we deal with the
ideal gas, right,

858
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,959
there's two paths you

859
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,239
can always take
to analyzing it.

860
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,400
One which is determining
properties directly.

861
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,159
Great. And the other
one is ideal gas there.

862
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,639
The point on the
ideal gas is we

863
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,359
can use TDS relations to

864
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,719
deal with these
expansion and

865
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,359
compression processes.

866
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,119
Good.

867
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,919
And for heat additions
and removals,

868
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:35,959
if it's an
isochoric process,

869
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:38,439
we model those as CVDTs.

870
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:40,040
If you use Pi Kilo,

871
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,959
you wouldn't
have to do that.

872
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,639
You would just go and

873
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,679
do either the difference

874
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,919
in the internal
energy for those,

875
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:49,720
all right. Any questions?

876
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,920
Are you ready for diesel?

877
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,079
So diesel was a
rational engine, okay?

878
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,439
Professor, I think it

879
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:59,080
is it Munich
to you Munich?

880
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,600
I think he was in Munich.

881
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,759
But his goal out of
that was basically to

882
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,119
develop a rational design

883
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,319
for an engine, right?

884
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:07,119
So let's go through it.

885
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,439
All right. And
they're basically

886
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:10,359
the same thing except
for one difference,

887
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:13,439
except for one difference.

888
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,639
Okay, well, hold on.

889
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:18,599
Let's say one thing
before I dive into that.

890
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,199
Okay. So here what
I'm showing you.

891
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,199
So from the formula
that I mentioned,

892
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,759
so this efficiency, if I

893
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:28,359
want to make it very
large, what should I do?

894
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,239
Squeeze the hell
out of it, right?

895
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,680
Basically, get the maximum

896
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,479
compression that
I can there,

897
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:36,479
and you'll get to

898
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:38,119
a very high
efficiency, right?

899
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,359
There's limits
to it, right?

900
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,680
You're never going
to be Carne.

901
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,999
But if you stay
within what you

902
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,319
have, you can get some
pretty good ones.

903
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,240
So what you should do,
then, as an engineer,

904
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,880
let's say you live
outside Detroit,

905
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,119
you know, there,
you're working

906
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,479
for Ford. Good job.

907
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,799
Go in and say, Hey,

908
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:52,239
I want to have a
very, you know,

909
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,320
large compression ratio.

910
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,599
What's going to happen to

911
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,799
a gasoline engine if

912
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:57,799
you start to make
this very large?

913
00:37:57,799 --> 00:38:02,289
Does anyone know? Loud.
Here. Say it again.

914
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:03,769
And what do we call that?

915
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:05,329
Knock. Basically, it's

916
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:06,969
going to knock, you
know, not like this.

917
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,249
It's going to detonate

918
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:11,649
before the spark plug
triggers it. All right?

919
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:12,929
So that's what
sets the limit.

920
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:14,690
Most of them have
this kind of values.

921
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,009
And so if you look
at that, then

922
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:17,569
the theoretical
efficiency,

923
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:18,849
what sets you then for

924
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:19,969
the constraints we have

925
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:21,489
is somewhere in
the neighborhood

926
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:22,690
of 50% to 60%.

927
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,449
But boy, it would
be nice if you get

928
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,250
to higher
compression ratios.

929
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,929
And that's what diesel is.

930
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:31,250
So a diesel engine doesn't
have a spark plug.

931
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,689
The ignition is all about

932
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:34,689
compressing the
shit out of it,

933
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:37,099
and then that triggers
combustion, ar?

934
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:39,589
The second thing about
a diesel is that

935
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:42,350
the combustion process
is not instantaneous.

936
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,830
It is not instantaneous.

937
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,869
This happens over
an amount of time.

938
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:48,269
It means that
it's not what?

939
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,239
So what was the
combustion process in

940
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:53,399
the auto cycle? What
did we treat that as?

941
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:55,959
Constant volume or
constant pressure?

942
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,159
Constant volume,
isochoric.

943
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,519
If something burns longer,

944
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,119
what would you expect

945
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,439
then that
combustion process

946
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,439
or that process would

947
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:04,319
be isochoric or isobaric.

948
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:06,799
Isobaric, okay? So
that's the difference.

949
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,679
So if you look
on a PV diagram

950
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,040
at a diesel cycle,

951
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,959
right, one to two is
this compression, right?

952
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,959
So this isentropic
compression.

953
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,999
Two to three is the
heat addition here.

954
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:21,229
I But that's constant
pressure now.

955
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:22,390
It's not constant volume.

956
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,549
Constant volume would be

957
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:25,029
going vertical, right,
like we did before,

958
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,869
but two to three,
it's an isobaric,

959
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,429
right? That's
how we treat it.

960
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:31,830
Three to four, isotropic,

961
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,229
which means here,
adiabatic, right?

962
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:35,549
That's an adiabatic line,

963
00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:36,589
and then four to one.

964
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:38,550
The cooling off of
it, the heat transfer

965
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,029
out is still iso
cork, though.

966
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:41,869
That is still considered
rapid, right?

967
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:44,349
So the only difference
between the auto and

968
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:48,549
the diesel is this
process of two to three.

969
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,589
Let me

970
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,499
All right.

971
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,059
So let's come
back to this.

972
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:23,819
So we can take
care of that.

973
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:25,500
We'll have this RC.

974
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,780
Let's stay one. We'll
have to see volume.

975
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,019
We'll have to see this.

976
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:33,539
We'll have to see
what we determine,

977
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,900
and there's no max.

978
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,779
Okay. Um So the one
difference is this,

979
00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:42,900
the two to three, and
that's a heat addition.

980
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,699
As a result of
this, we have to

981
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:46,979
somehow describe that
in the problem, okay?

982
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:48,939
And the way that you
do this is you say,

983
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:51,220
not only do I have that
compression ratio,

984
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,259
so one to two
in compression,

985
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:58,220
but I have another
ratio of volumes,

986
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,299
which is the volume
after combustion

987
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:04,859
divided by the volume
before combustion.

988
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:05,539
And this is called

989
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:08,020
a cutoff ratio
cutoff ratio.

990
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,739
So it's RC, right?

991
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:11,899
Not a race car.
Okay, RC, right?

992
00:41:11,899 --> 00:41:15,859
V three by V two.

993
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,739
The analysis is
the same, though.

994
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,859
So we treat this
as an ideal gas.

995
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:25,859
So we'll treat it as
an ideal gas there.

996
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:26,739
That's one.

997
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:29,899
Expansion and
compression processes

998
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:31,180
are still isotropic.

999
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,419
So all the stuff that
I did before, right?

1000
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:42,179
So when I, T two
is equal to T one

1001
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:50,069
times V one by

1002
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:54,469
right V two to the
Kappa minus one, right?

1003
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:56,029
So this is right
V one by V two,

1004
00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:58,069
so that should increase
if that's good.

1005
00:41:58,069 --> 00:42:00,269
This was R, right?

1006
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:05,329
That's the definition
of R. That's fine.

1007
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:11,489
From T four being
to T three.

1008
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:16,769
So V four is down here.

1009
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:19,329
Here is V one,

1010
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,089
also from V three, sorry,

1011
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:25,889
to the the Kappa
minus one.

1012
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:28,370
This is no longer.

1013
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,729
This is basically
no longer

1014
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:33,969
that same ratio
that we had before.

1015
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,170
What's the reasoning?

1016
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,419
So when I go from V one,

1017
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:43,510
Let's say V one is equal
to V two times times

1018
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:51,190
R. V three is equal
to V two times RC.

1019
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,710
So that's the
cutoff ratio.

1020
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,349
And so if I want to make

1021
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:58,869
that substitution,
right, that's V.

1022
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,749
If I want to make
that substitution,

1023
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,709
this will then be T three

1024
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:09,030
times V two times RC.

1025
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,429
And for V four, V

1026
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:14,869
four is still
equal to what?

1027
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,469
If I'm returning
back, if I have

1028
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,189
isochoric cooling,
right at the end of it,

1029
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:22,110
so four to one
based on that plot,

1030
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,669
what would you
say that V one

1031
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,349
is relative to V four?

1032
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,069
It's the same, okay?

1033
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:29,349
So you have this.

1034
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:30,669
And so what
you'll have then

1035
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:36,069
here is that, okay?

1036
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:37,829
And that's no
longer, right?

1037
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,069
It's no longer
just, you know,

1038
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:40,269
one over R here, right?

1039
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:44,269
You have an RC with
an R that comes in.

1040
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:45,869
And that's it, right?

1041
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:47,189
Pretty much
everything else

1042
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:51,150
is the same except
for, right, the QN.

1043
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,549
So what is the Q in for

1044
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:55,829
an ideal gas for an
isobaric process?

1045
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:06,439
All right. Maybe too
fast. All right.

1046
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:09,039
So if I go from,

1047
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,719
this is two to
32 to three,

1048
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,160
which is my heat addition.

1049
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,119
My heat addition,
I'm going to

1050
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,079
draw control
volume like that.

1051
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,080
And I expand some
amount it happens,

1052
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,239
and the pressure P two
is equal to P three.

1053
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:38,199
Okay? So I have

1054
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:42,570
Qn And what else do
I have happening?

1055
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,889
What other energy
exchange am I

1056
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,689
having for my
control volume here?

1057
00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:47,609
Work Out, right?

1058
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:50,209
So I have W out.

1059
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:51,609
So if I write
the first law,

1060
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:52,769
neglecting changes in

1061
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:54,409
Kineticut
potential energy,

1062
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:57,329
Delta U is then equal to

1063
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:00,769
Q in because
there's no Q out

1064
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:05,369
minus W out
because there's

1065
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:10,209
no W in Q in minus.

1066
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:11,849
So it's an
isoeric process.

1067
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:12,970
What is the formula

1068
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,969
going to be for
the workout?

1069
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:22,769
Right? V three
divided by V two,

1070
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:24,529
can move that to the
other side, right?

1071
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:26,009
So I'm going
to my Delta U,

1072
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:31,089
which is U three plus p2v3

1073
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:38,010
minus two plus p2v2
is equal to Qn.

1074
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:44,369
What is this? Not
everyone at once here.

1075
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:45,209
Enthalpy.

1076
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,009
Enthalpy, right?
This is your H

1077
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:52,649
three minus H two
is equal to Q in.

1078
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,569
Of course, you can
write this as,

1079
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:55,929
since it's a
closed system,

1080
00:45:55,929 --> 00:45:57,689
no energy, no
mass in or out.

1081
00:45:57,689 --> 00:46:00,089
Little H three
minus little H

1082
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:01,649
two is equal to Q in.

1083
00:46:01,649 --> 00:46:03,729
You could pillow
that and get it.

1084
00:46:03,729 --> 00:46:05,249
Or what approximation can

1085
00:46:05,249 --> 00:46:07,729
I make because this
is an ideal guess?

1086
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:14,689
That's it. Cp
Delta T. Cp T

1087
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:19,369
three minus T two is
equal to n, okay?

1088
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:21,449
So if you think about
the efficiency, then,

1089
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:24,169
if we think about the
thermal efficiency

1090
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:27,519
of this cycle, right?

1091
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,549
All right. Or let's
start with W net, right?

1092
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:37,349
W net is equal to
Q in minus Q out,

1093
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:39,589
so W net out, right?

1094
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:43,149
My Q in is CP,

1095
00:46:43,149 --> 00:46:46,029
T three minus T two.

1096
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:54,149
My Q out is CV T four
minus T one, okay?

1097
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:00,309
So the thermal efficiency
of a diesel cycle,

1098
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:05,789
just like any cycle, W
net out, divided by Q.

1099
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:09,069
And so what that
will look like is

1100
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:15,869
CP three minus
two minus MCV,

1101
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:19,109
T four minus T one,

1102
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:20,669
all of that divided by

1103
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:25,389
M CP three minus T two.

1104
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:27,429
You could do some
simplifications,

1105
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:28,509
you know, to that.

1106
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:30,630
In the interest of
time, I'll spare

1107
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,069
you for it and get
to the message.

1108
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:36,549
Um But if you can do
some simplifications,

1109
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,149
and what you'll
end up with is

1110
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:39,829
a formula for
the efficiency

1111
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:41,629
that looks just like auto

1112
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,269
with a modification term.

1113
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:46,429
So if the cutoff ratio
is equal to one,

1114
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:49,629
you recover the auto
cycle efficiency, okay?

1115
00:47:49,629 --> 00:47:52,029
So if RC equals to one,

1116
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:55,269
you'll end up with that.

1117
00:47:55,269 --> 00:47:57,789
But this can be simplified

1118
00:47:57,789 --> 00:48:02,749
down to that there, okay?

1119
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,590
So if we want to compare,

1120
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,429
then the efficiency
of an auto cycle as

1121
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:06,949
a function of

1122
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:08,669
compression ratio
of both cases,

1123
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:10,189
remember this is auto and

1124
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:12,029
the typical values
of compression.

1125
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:13,789
For diesel, much
higher, right?

1126
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:16,749
As a factor of two higher.

1127
00:48:16,749 --> 00:48:18,349
And also plotted
on here are

1128
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:20,189
the different cutoff
ratios there from one,

1129
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:24,589
which is auto excuse me.

1130
00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:25,509
Right,

1131
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:27,309
which one is the auto
and on down, right?

1132
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:28,389
And the take home message

1133
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:29,309
is that by getting up to

1134
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:31,469
these higher
compression ratios,

1135
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:32,949
you're getting
efficiencies that

1136
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:33,589
are then, you know,

1137
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:35,909
well above, maybe 10%
above what you have.

1138
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,389
And with that, I'm
going to close.

1139
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:38,669
You should be able
to do all this here.

1140
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:39,829
We got two more lectures

1141
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:41,070
in the gas power cycles.

1142
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,389
I'm very enthusiastic.

1143
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:45,359
Have a good one. Let go.
