1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,160
Alright, I got 210. I'm
going to get started.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,959
So today, we're continuing

3
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:08,400
with our second law.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,640
So we're going to cover

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,640
some aspects and
refrigeration,

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,440
some power plants, and
then get into more

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,119
into the Karno
Karno cycle,

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,519
which we started
last time, okay?

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,729
Yeah, so, This is

10
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:27,570
how the arnocycle
looks like.

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,129
Recall, we have
heat transferred in

12
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:35,169
a system from high
temperature isothermally.

13
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,609
At the same time, we

14
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,089
have a work transfer
out process.

15
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,209
Then you have an adiabatic
expansion process

16
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:43,009
which drops our temperature
from high to low.

17
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,649
We have heat
transferred out

18
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:48,969
of the system to a low
temperature reservoir,

19
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,699
TL And then at

20
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,019
the same time,
we're compressing,

21
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,900
and then we have
adiabatic compression,

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,259
which takes us from
the low temperature

23
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,499
to the high
temperature, right?

24
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:00,379
But the key attribute
of this is that one,

25
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,499
that we operate
between these

26
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,379
two temperatures
and that all of

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,500
the work transfer
processes

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,339
are reversible,
reversible, okay?

29
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:11,859
And that's going
to be the basis

30
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,139
of next week when we

31
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,940
introduce our next
character entropy,

32
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,979
all right? You
can reverse it.

33
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:19,819
So I mentioned this

34
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,939
also at the end
of the last time

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,439
is that if you run
it in reverse, okay,

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,860
So the thermal
engines go clockwise,

37
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,500
the heat pumps go
counterclockwise.

38
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,979
What you're going
to do then is

39
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,219
you're just going
to pump heat from

40
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:34,259
the low temperature
reservoir and put it

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,739
into the high
temperature, right?

42
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,859
So on an application
on a cold winter day,

43
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:41,699
right, that would be
your house, okay?

44
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:43,979
Or on a hot day, right?

45
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,779
That's the inside of
your fridge, okay?

46
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:49,259
But also, remember,
an attribute of

47
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,339
the cycle is that the

48
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,139
network that we
transfer out,

49
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,659
so W net out is equal

50
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,819
to the net heat
we transfer in.

51
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,339
And the reason for that is

52
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,219
that we end up where
we start, right?

53
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,659
And if we end up
where we start,

54
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,564
that's a property, okay?

55
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:05,789
It's a property.
So it means that,

56
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:08,310
from the first law, right?

57
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,510
So if my property is

58
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,189
my internal
energy throughout

59
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,750
that whole thing,
from the first law,

60
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,190
we know that the if

61
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,630
the change in the
internal energy

62
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,989
at this point
is then zero,

63
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,910
right, the heat
that we put

64
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,909
in must be equal to

65
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:21,989
the work that we
take out, right?

66
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,630
Because the first
law is Delta U

67
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,115
is basically a Q
minus W, okay?

68
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:28,199
Good, super.

69
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,080
Alright, let's talk
about power plants.

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,440
All right.

71
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,720
So what is a

72
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,840
typical thermoelectric
power plant look like?

73
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,679
This is still, like I
said, a majority of

74
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,520
most energy electricity is

75
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,880
produced in this way.

76
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,960
So what you have here to

77
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,560
start with between
States one,

78
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,400
let's say States one

79
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
and State's two is you
have a pump, okay?

80
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,320
And with this pump, you're

81
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,880
putting some work
transferred in.

82
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,440
Allright? This then enters

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,720
into what's called
a boiler, okay?

84
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,015
So you have a boiler here.

85
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,349
All right. All right.

86
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:08,149
This is your cue,
basically your q.in,

87
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:12,709
which is which is here
out of this boiler.

88
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,699
Okay. This thing goes
into into a turbine.

89
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,450
Okay. So this basically is

90
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,090
your turbine in, okay?

91
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,889
And from here,
right, we have

92
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:27,210
basically our W dot out.

93
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,970
And then out of

94
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,450
the end of this
turbine, okay,

95
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,250
this thing goes into
another heat exchanger,

96
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,690
which we term as a
condenser, okay?

97
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,209
And then here's where
you have your Q

98
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,730
dot out.

99
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,569
And this whole thing,
right, starts again.

100
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:45,970
So I have states one,

101
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,690
which is here,
State two here,

102
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,210
State three here,
and then State four,

103
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,210
which is here. Any
clarifications?

104
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,090
Cool.

105
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,339
Oh, it gets better,
man. Don't worry.

106
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:03,500
Alright. So this is

107
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,700
what we're talking
about here.

108
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,140
And so in this problem, so

109
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,780
this is a problem
from six.

110
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,459
I believe I have 617.

111
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,140
The question is, you know,

112
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,779
we'd like to

113
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,519
determine determine
what's called

114
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,120
the efficiency

115
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,200
the thermal efficiency
of its efficiency.

116
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,239
So eta, is the
Greek letter Ea.

117
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,759
I put H to indicate that

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,839
it's a thermal engine,

119
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,839
and I'd like to know

120
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:38,279
the net power
output, okay?

121
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,759
So mathematically, right,

122
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,199
that's basically
w.net out, okay,

123
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,320
which is by definition,

124
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,720
equal to W dot
out minus w.in.

125
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,369
All right? We're given
some information.

126
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:00,650
So the information
that we're

127
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,329
given here is that
for our q.in,

128
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,410
we're told that it's

129
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,810
transferred in
at a rate of

130
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,970
280 gigajoules per hour.

131
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,049
Mm hmm. We're told

132
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,849
that we have a
Q dot out here,

133
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:21,085
which is equal to 165.

134
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:24,240
Gigajoules per hour.

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,760
We're also told that
there's some losses.

136
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,559
So for example, you know,

137
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,159
as I'm transferring,
you know,

138
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,079
let's say, hot steam
into the turbine,

139
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,439
I could have thermal
losses that happen here,

140
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,160
and that's to the tune of

141
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,479
eight gigajoules per
hour of losses, okay?

142
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,879
This we don't know.

143
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,999
We don't know how
much work is in.

144
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:53,399
So what do we do?

145
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,559
Assume steady. Sure.
We can do that.

146
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,319
So we have a steady
do we assume, right?

147
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,479
So we assume, right,

148
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,480
that we're
operating under,

149
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,640
let's say, a steady
state condition.

150
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,360
So, this whole
thing is going.

151
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,879
So each of the devices are

152
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,119
steady flow
devices, right?

153
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,240
So, write a pump,
a heat exchanger,

154
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,360
a turbine, another
heat exchanger

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,479
in a in a loop, okay?

156
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,339
More specifically, what do

157
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,499
you do if you want to

158
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:35,739
determine let's start
with this one, right?

159
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:39,340
Because this is
essentially a bit easier.

160
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
What piece of information

161
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,339
that I give you about

162
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,300
cycles and network
with respect to heat?

163
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,219
Okay. All right, so
we have here, right,

164
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:58,259
our q.net in, right,

165
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,819
is equal to our
w.net out, right?

166
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,939
And that's a feature
of a cycle, okay?

167
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,699
That's a feature
of a cycle, right?

168
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:06,579
If you want to know what

169
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,739
this basically
looked like,

170
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,459
try to draw this
from memory.

171
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,220
But this type of cycle

172
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,139
here looks something
like this.

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,880
Okay, like that,
and the point

174
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,359
is, it's a cycle.

175
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,000
And so then the area
contained within

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,280
that curve is
the net workout,

177
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,079
and it must be
from the first law

178
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,199
equal to the net heat in.

179
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,280
How can we define
the net heat

180
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,399
in based on this?
What would you do?

181
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,309
Okay, so we've drawn

182
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,309
control volumes for each
individual elements,

183
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:45,589
right?

184
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,549
You can also draw
control volume for

185
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:49,709
the entire power
plant, right?

186
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,949
So if I draw a
control volume

187
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,109
for the entire basically,

188
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,429
maybe I'll draw
like, you know,

189
00:07:57,429 --> 00:07:58,949
a box around it,
so I have this.

190
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:00,789
So my flows are, right?

191
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,469
I have a Q dot.

192
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:08,109
In, right? I'll
have a Q dot out,

193
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:10,110
which I know,
and then I have

194
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,989
a Q dot loss, okay?

195
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:14,510
Basically, let's
say, like a Q dot,

196
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,069
you know, loss, which
is also there, okay?

197
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:24,109
So then from this, right,

198
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:25,389
what we can say
is that our

199
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:30,389
q.net in is equal to
what comes in, right,

200
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,830
q.in minus the
sum of Q dot

201
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:39,230
out plus Q dot loss, okay?

202
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,830
Our q.in is what?

203
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,830
It's 280 gigajoules
per hour.

204
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:53,390
Q dot out is 165
gigajoules per hour,

205
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,029
and the Q dot loss is

206
00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:03,830
eight gigajoules
per hour. Mmm.

207
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,029
So if I do that,
I have 107.

208
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:11,070
I have 107 gigajoules
per hour is then

209
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,389
my is my q.net.

210
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,160
I, okay, which by
definition here is also

211
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,280
equal to my
w.net out, okay?

212
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,599
So that C.

213
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,679
And now we can talk
about efficiencies,

214
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,199
okay? So
efficiencies here.

215
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,880
So to the first
part, so for,

216
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,350
um, For the efficiencies,
and in general,

217
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,950
when you're thinking about

218
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,830
defining figures of merit,

219
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,350
you take the ratio of
the thing you desire,

220
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,030
and you divide it by

221
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,550
the thing that
you pay, okay?

222
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,070
So, like, you know,
you know, okay.

223
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,870
That's all I'm going
to say. So, all right,

224
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,390
so basically the
definition of this,

225
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,349
so the thing
that we want is

226
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:14,790
the net power
output, right?

227
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,790
So this basically is
defined as W net,

228
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,760
um, divided by Q in.

229
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,239
I I wrote it in rate
notation, right?

230
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:28,440
If this is a steady
system and it's closed,

231
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,640
right,

232
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,520
the M dots that

233
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,479
would be in here
would go away.

234
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,520
It could also just
be little W net and

235
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,720
little Q in. All right?

236
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,960
You'll sometimes see
this written as,

237
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,890
um, All right, no, this
is basically fine.

238
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,290
You can also write
this because w.net is

239
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,690
equal to q.net, right?

240
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,370
I could also write q dot.

241
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,850
This is net out q.net

242
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,770
in divided by q.in, right?

243
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,730
That's another way that

244
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,810
you can do that, right?

245
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,089
And so if we substitute

246
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,290
in our numbers, so
what do I have?

247
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,370
I have 107, right?

248
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,370
So I have here 107
gigajoules per hour.

249
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,809
And then what's my q.in?

250
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:14,889
My Q dot N is

251
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:21,010
280 80 gigajoules per
hour. What is it?

252
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,010
Like, yeah, 38.
It's basically

253
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,610
38% efficiency.

254
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,930
38 me write that
better, right?

255
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,520
38%, okay?

256
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,360
And this is where we're
going now, right?

257
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,200
So everything we did
in part five, right,

258
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,159
was to talk about

259
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,840
these individual
elements, right,

260
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,520
with the heat
exchangers, turbines,

261
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,800
compressors, and
all of that.

262
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,240
And to make power cycles

263
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,480
and heat pumps
and all of that,

264
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,960
we string all
of these things

265
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,360
into series. We
close the loop.

266
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,640
We call it a cycle,

267
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,680
and we're interested
in things like that,

268
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,279
the work in,
the networking,

269
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,880
the net heat
out, like that.

270
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,200
This is a very easy
problem, right?

271
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,400
This is a very easy
problem because all I did

272
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
at the end of it is I kind

273
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,280
of lumped all those
elements together,

274
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,399
and then I just said,
Look, I know my q.in,

275
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,519
I know my Q dot out,

276
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,879
I know my Q dot loss.

277
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,720
But actually, a lot of

278
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,950
what we're going
to be doing

279
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,420
is determining these
properties at state two,

280
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,980
three, four,
and one. Okay?

281
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,099
So the enthalpies,
multiply those by dots,

282
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,739
and then you get
things like q.in,

283
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,740
W dot out, and so
on and so forth.

284
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,060
Okay? All right.

285
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,539
And the reason why
I can't give that

286
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,139
to you next is to do this,

287
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:28,979
I need to give you,

288
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,260
again, this other property

289
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,500
to be able to
analyze, okay?

290
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,980
Clear? Great. Grace, do,

291
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,310
do, do. All right.

292
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,630
Maybe a good
segue, though,

293
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,550
before we dive into some
refrigeration is to

294
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,830
talk for a second about

295
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,590
what is the maximum
efficiency.

296
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,670
So I said before that
the Karnea cycle

297
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,030
sets the absolute
maximum efficiency

298
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,669
that's attainable.

299
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:03,389
I just told you
that. And what

300
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,710
we can do is we
can actually

301
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,630
define what
that efficiency

302
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,150
would be and what
it depends on.

303
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,670
Alright? So a
little bit of math.

304
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,309
19th century.

305
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,870
Alright. Good it.

306
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,389
This one sucks.

307
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:27,210
This one better.
Okay, that's better.

308
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:33,970
All right. Okay, so
we drew with Carne.

309
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,930
Maybe I can just
blank this out.

310
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,650
Okay. All right,

311
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,409
we drew with Karno
last time right?

312
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,929
So I have here one
to two, let's say.

313
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:49,250
So this is he

314
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,810
transferred out in
compression, two to three.

315
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,169
I have some adiabatic
compression,

316
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,570
three to four
isothermal expansion,

317
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,649
and then four to one
adiabatic expansion,

318
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:04,850
right?

319
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,289
So these are work
transferred in processes,

320
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:10,290
and these are work
transferred out.

321
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,049
Along this line, this is

322
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:15,850
an isotherm where
T is equal to TH,

323
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,129
and along this isotherm,

324
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,529
we have T equals to TC.

325
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,740
So I'm going to call
it for um, cold, okay?

326
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,220
So TH is my hot,

327
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,060
and then TC is my cold.

328
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,420
The book, a lot
of times I'll

329
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,020
write this also
sometimes as TL.

330
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,420
So L for low or
C, um, for cold.

331
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,700
We only have one
word for hot,

332
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,300
so we have H, all right?

333
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,740
So that's our cycle, okay?

334
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,900
Um, T, do, do,

335
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,140
do, do, do, do.

336
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,400
All right.

337
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,040
And in this cycle, okay,

338
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,240
when we transfer, right,

339
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,720
so the heat that's
transferred

340
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,239
here is in from right,

341
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,680
so we have Q
we have, like,

342
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,320
a a Q in here
at TH, right?

343
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,880
And we have basically
a Q out here,

344
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,120
which is then
transferred then into

345
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,280
the cold right into the

346
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,380
cold, side, all right?

347
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,340
So let's focus for a
second on and again,

348
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,340
while we transfer
this heat in,

349
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,220
right, we have the work
transfer process out.

350
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,739
While we transfer
the heat out,

351
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,060
we have the work
transfer in.

352
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,620
And these two things
are equal, right?

353
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,220
Remember,

354
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,660
we did that example
with the piston.

355
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,340
I put that amount
of heat in.

356
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,260
And, of course,
because it's

357
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,500
isothermal, right,

358
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,540
the same amount of work

359
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,780
had to be transferred
out, right?

360
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,660
So let's make some
assumptions about this.

361
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,340
We're going to deal
with an ideal gas.

362
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,740
We don't need to, but we

363
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,459
will because it's
instructive.

364
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:42,260
We'll deal with
an ideal gas.

365
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,780
And let's say that
we're working

366
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,220
the work transfer
work transfer

367
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:55,360
is only a boundary
work, okay?

368
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,040
And boundary work is what?

369
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,640
PdV. All right?
You're going

370
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,120
to ace the quiz.
All right.

371
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,880
PdV. Okay? All right,

372
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,039
PdV PDV work there,

373
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,279
which is our boundary,

374
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,559
our boundary
work. All right.

375
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,640
So let's focus
on one, two.

376
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,840
So and I can write
W. You know,

377
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,959
one, two is equal to.

378
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,375
You can also write this
as like a little M.

379
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,470
W one, two, where this has

380
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,749
units of joules
per kilogram,

381
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:32,469
so I can have
it like that.

382
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,950
And then this is equal to

383
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,669
my M times the
integral from

384
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:44,550
state one to two of PD V,

385
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,640
where V is then
little V, um, right?

386
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,400
If we're dealing with
an ideal gas, right?

387
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,360
So we have PV.

388
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,040
P little V is equal to Rt.

389
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,240
So this is the
specific gas constant.

390
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,680
This would depend
on your substance

391
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,039
in the end of the washout.

392
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,240
But for now, we
can write this

393
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,640
as just, you know,

394
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,559
some ideal gas that has a

395
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,919
constant R. If we
substitute this into here,

396
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,519
right, what we're
going to have is P

397
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,519
is equal to RT
divided by V,

398
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,879
and that's going
to go into here.

399
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,959
So then my, um, And if

400
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,479
I write it just as
little W one, two.

401
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,239
So if I just
focus on this,

402
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,719
this is going to
be equal to then,

403
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,240
the integral
of one to two,

404
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,720
R T divided by
V dV, right?

405
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,439
And this is
going to produce

406
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,519
a natural log, right?

407
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,279
It's basically going to

408
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,480
produce a natural log.

409
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,759
And so what I'm
going to have

410
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,440
is why is it a
natural log?

411
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,119
Because R is a
constant and T is

412
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,240
a constant because this is

413
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,360
an isothermal process.

414
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,039
So I could take those out,

415
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,439
and I have R T,

416
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,999
natural log of
little V two

417
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:53,360
divided by little V
one, all right? Cool.

418
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,070
All right. And
the temperature.

419
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,630
The point is that

420
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,950
didn't declare
the temperature.

421
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,110
What is the
temperature that I'm

422
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,309
transfring heat
out here at?

423
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,270
So it's an isothermal
or transfer process.

424
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,989
What's the temperature
of one to two?

425
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:09,349
TC, right? So
this is TC here.

426
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:12,070
If this is a
compression process

427
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,509
is V two going to

428
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,734
be greater than or
less than V one?

429
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:21,040
So what is the sign
of the natural log

430
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,039
here if V two is
less than V one?

431
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,479
It's negative, okay?
So then this W one,

432
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,119
two would be a
negative, okay?

433
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,160
So if I wanted to call
this as, for example,

434
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,959
W, you know,
let's say W in,

435
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,119
let's say one, two, right?

436
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,280
This would be equal
to the negative of

437
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,559
RTC natural log of V
two divided by V one,

438
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,919
okay, just to
be consistent.

439
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:47,840
So here I didn't

440
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,799
say anything
about in and out.

441
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,039
The fact that
I'm writing in

442
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,559
here now and applying
it to one, two,

443
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,479
I have to put the
negative sign because of

444
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,840
the fact that
that'll be negative.

445
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,325
Okay, that's good. TC.

446
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:00,770
All right, it's
isothermal.

447
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,209
So isothermal one to two.

448
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,329
So if we look back
to our Delta E of

449
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,169
the control volume
is equal to E

450
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:12,610
in minus E out, right?

451
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,009
This can then be Delta U

452
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,370
if we neglect Kineticut
potential energies,

453
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:17,609
right?

454
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:21,050
This would then be Wn plus

455
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:28,369
Qn minus W out
plus Q out, okay?

456
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,970
So it's isothermal.

457
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,650
What does that mean about

458
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,169
the internal
energy here for

459
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:36,510
an ideal gas?
It's constant.

460
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,749
It's unchanged, right?

461
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:40,029
So because it's
isothermal for

462
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:42,989
this process of one,

463
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:47,109
two, this is constant.

464
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,989
Do we have work in?

465
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,069
Yes. Do we have Q in?

466
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:56,269
Yes? No, right?

467
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:00,959
Do we have W
out? No, right?

468
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,800
But we do have Q
out. And the point

469
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,239
from this exercise of one,

470
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:07,199
two is that Q out, right?

471
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:12,239
One, two is then
equal to W in, right?

472
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:14,679
One, two, okay? So we

473
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,719
can write this on
a per mass basis.

474
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:18,199
I can divide
both sides by M,

475
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,919
and I can say little
Q out, right?

476
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,800
One, two is equal to

477
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,560
little W in one,
two, right?

478
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,279
And so what does
it mean for this?

479
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:34,309
It means that Q out One,

480
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:39,709
two is equal to
the negative of

481
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:43,789
RTC natural log of

482
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,629
V two divided
by V one, okay?

483
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:48,269
And that's an
important first step.

484
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:50,429
So we wrote our first real

485
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,949
formula with this, okay?

486
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,009
So we can do the
same thing for

487
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,329
the W out, right?
So the W out.

488
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:04,249
Right here, we can look
at the three to four.

489
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:10,609
So W out out three,
four, little W,

490
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:14,010
and it is then equal
to ideal gas constant,

491
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,089
high temperature of the

492
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,010
reservoir and natural log,

493
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,529
little V four
divided by V three.

494
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,249
The sign of this is

495
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,330
correct because the
specific volume

496
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,250
at state four
will be larger,

497
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,649
right, than that
at state three.

498
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:34,649
So that looks that all
looks fine, right?

499
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:37,529
We know that W out three,

500
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,569
four must be
equal to Q in at

501
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,969
34 because the other
two legs that we have

502
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,569
analyze are
idiabatic processes,

503
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:48,329
or you can go through

504
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,409
the same thing that
I just said now,

505
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,009
which is that
it's isothermal,

506
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,969
and you can follow
that whole step

507
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:55,410
and arrive at that
same conclusion.

508
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,890
All right. So our
thermal efficiency

509
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,569
here is equal to what?

510
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,290
So what do we desire?

511
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,599
Okay, we desire
work. All right.

512
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,119
I'll carry the load
today, all right?

513
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,799
So we carry the
W net and Q in.

514
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,199
And W net is also equal

515
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:26,679
to Q net, right, right?

516
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,559
Which is basically Q in

517
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,799
minus Q divided by
Q in, all right?

518
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,319
We're getting
close. All right.

519
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,599
We have formulas, right?

520
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,319
So we have a formula
for our cue out.

521
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,679
We have a formula for
our Q in, all right?

522
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:53,399
And so I guess I can
say it this way.

523
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:54,079
If we were to do

524
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,439
a sum of all the
cue you know,

525
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,439
these are just two
legs, because one,

526
00:22:57,439 --> 00:23:00,280
four and two, three
are adiabatic,

527
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,479
So let's say like this,

528
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:06,719
our Q in is equal to

529
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:13,359
our what we call
this Q in three,

530
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,439
four, because
this, like I said,

531
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,800
two, three, and four,
one are diabatic.

532
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,839
Our Q out is equal to
what we had there,

533
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,919
which was our Q out
one, two, okay?

534
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,999
And so if we substitute
those formulas in,

535
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:33,879
what we would have
then for our Q and

536
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,999
three Q and 34 is

537
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:43,280
R T H natural log

538
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,599
of V four divided by
V three minus our Q,

539
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:56,440
which is where RTC,
RTC, natural log.

540
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,079
I think I have V
natural log of.

541
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,679
So this is the
minus, right?

542
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,679
So let me get this right.

543
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,959
Okay, so this is
minus a minus, right?

544
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:14,815
So I have negative
R, TC natural log,

545
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:19,709
of V two divided by V one,

546
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,030
and then again,
divided by the Q,

547
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,390
which is your R TH,

548
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:31,269
natural log V four
divided by V three, okay?

549
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,389
And so the challenge
right now is we

550
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,269
need to deal we'd like to

551
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:37,909
have V two and V one to be

552
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,949
like the V four
and the V three.

553
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:44,269
And so for this,
what we can

554
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:46,909
recall is that this is,

555
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,520
right, it's four to
one and two to three

556
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,919
are adiabatic
processes, okay?

557
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,999
So if I look at PV

558
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,639
to the gamma equal
to C, right?

559
00:24:58,639 --> 00:24:59,680
This is what we
proved before

560
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,920
for an adiabatic process.

561
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,960
This is adiabatic,
adiabatic,

562
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:13,640
you know, expansion or
adiabatic compression.

563
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,199
And so what we so
that's one thing.

564
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:20,719
To be able to do this,

565
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,079
we've got to make sort

566
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,559
of a slight
transformation.

567
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:29,239
So I can write if
I go PV like this,

568
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,719
is V to the Gamma

569
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,520
minus one is equal
to C, right?

570
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,080
So basically, I pulled

571
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,639
a specific volume
out of this.

572
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,639
Now I have Gamma
to the minus one.

573
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,560
Idel gas equation.

574
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,599
This is nothing
but Rt N times

575
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,999
Gamma minus one
equals to C.

576
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:48,760
Since R is a constant,

577
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,599
TV Gamma minus one

578
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,119
is equal to C
divided by R,

579
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,239
or we could call this
as like C one, okay?

580
00:25:56,239 --> 00:26:01,039
All right. Um. And now

581
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,599
we'll apply this to these

582
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,159
two legs here, all right?

583
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,889
Uh. All right.

584
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:10,609
So the first one,

585
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:15,129
I have T cold V two,

586
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:18,369
Gamma minus one,
two, right?

587
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,609
So that'll bring me then

588
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:21,089
to three, State three,

589
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:24,449
which is TH V three,

590
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,969
Gamma minus one,

591
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,209
and then we can do

592
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:29,409
the same thing the
other way, right?

593
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:31,409
I can write TC at

594
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:36,089
V one Gamma minus
one, which is here.

595
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:39,449
And then that must be
H and V four, right?

596
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:44,959
TH and V four,
Gamma minus one.

597
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,949
All right. We're
almost there.

598
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:48,349
We're almost able to now

599
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:49,469
relate because now if

600
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:50,869
I divide these two things,

601
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:53,429
so if I divide
this, right,

602
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,190
the TCs are gone,

603
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,870
the Hs are gone.

604
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,309
And so what you'll
have then is V

605
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:06,190
two divided by V
one to the Gamma

606
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,509
minus one is
then equal to V

607
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:10,909
three divided by V

608
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,669
four to the Gamma
minus one, okay?

609
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:16,190
And the Gamma minus
ones can go away.

610
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,349
And so what you'll have

611
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:18,629
then is now what we saw,

612
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:20,749
which is V two
divided by V

613
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:24,389
one is V three
divided by V four.

614
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:25,989
Okay.

615
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,309
So, now with this,

616
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:33,629
we can come back
to this term here.

617
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:36,869
So V two divided by V

618
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:40,829
one is hold on a second.

619
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,710
This is the negative.
Okay, so this is

620
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,310
an important part
that I have to deal

621
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,869
with here before I

622
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:46,029
do the substitution
Alright,

623
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:47,590
suppose I can do
the substitution.

624
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,749
So the V two divided
by the V one,

625
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:51,349
this is equal to V

626
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:54,829
three divided by V
four, all right?

627
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,430
And that's almost
how we wanted it,

628
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,469
although we'd like V
four divided by V three.

629
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,349
We'll bring this
back to center

630
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,349
stage here and move

631
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,269
this out.

632
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,189
All right.

633
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,749
So I have here a
negative, right?

634
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:24,709
A negative of a
natural log does what?

635
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,789
Right? I can invert it.

636
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,709
Anything that's here, I
can put to the power.

637
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:32,029
So then v3v4 to the
negative one is

638
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:35,389
then V four divided
by V three, okay?

639
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:39,229
So this goes away, right?

640
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:44,359
And then this is V

641
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:53,079
four divided by
V three, R gone.

642
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,679
Natural log of V
four divided by V

643
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,599
three, gone, gone, gone.

644
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:06,119
TH minus TC divided by

645
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,439
H or how it's more
commonly written is

646
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:13,399
one minus c divided by H.

647
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,379
So if you want to make

648
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:32,460
a very efficient device

649
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,899
for producing power,
what do you do?

650
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,339
Name and what do you do?

651
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,349
That's it. That's it.

652
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,309
That's it. Okay?

653
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:47,829
And this temperature
is Kelvin, right?

654
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,229
This is an absolute scale.

655
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:50,509
This only works
in Kelvin, right?

656
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:52,309
If you starting 0
Celsius in there,

657
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:53,269
then you're going to get

658
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,309
some some weird numbers.

659
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:56,630
But, yeah, that's
exactly it.

660
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,469
So when you think about

661
00:29:57,469 --> 00:29:59,789
a cycle or you look at it,

662
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,150
you know, they're
essentially,

663
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,949
you know, you want to

664
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:04,309
be having heat transferred

665
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:06,469
in from something that's

666
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:08,389
at high temperature,
all right?

667
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,389
And the lower
the temperature

668
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:12,349
that you transfer
the heat in from,

669
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:14,989
the lower the efficiency
will be, okay?

670
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:17,069
This is a way of
saying, right,

671
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:21,709
that heat has a quality
to it, all right?

672
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:23,989
You can rank it. You can

673
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,709
basically say if it
has a value, okay?

674
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,270
So we talk about
low grade heat.

675
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,189
Low grade heat is like,

676
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:30,549
I don't know,

677
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:32,389
waste heat out of
a building, right?

678
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:33,669
It's heat that's

679
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:34,589
being transferred
from something

680
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,550
that's at a relatively
low temperature,

681
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,909
and we don't use it, okay?

682
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:39,909
But if you start taking
heat off of things

683
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:42,589
that are at higher
temperatures, all right?

684
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:44,190
In a process,
you can start

685
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,309
to make use of
these things, okay?

686
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:48,189
I think there was a
question in front.

687
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:49,069
Yeah.

688
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:55,229
Name. Arturo. So the

689
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,589
negative so this comes
back to here, okay?

690
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,469
And even further,
which is to this,

691
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:04,789
if I want to
talk about work

692
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:09,949
in from state one to
state two, all right?

693
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,229
And because it's an in,

694
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:13,350
I'm declaring the value.

695
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,110
So what I need to
produce here needs to be

696
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,470
a positive value
because I'm

697
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,349
writing in, okay?

698
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:20,469
For that to
happen, I have to

699
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:22,629
look and see my
volume at state two.

700
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:23,830
This is a
compression process.

701
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,949
So V two is going to
be less than V one.

702
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:29,030
The natural log of that
ratio is negative.

703
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,790
So to make this a positive

704
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,310
quantity and to be
a work in process,

705
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,869
I have to put a
negative sign.

706
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:39,459
One, two, The work

707
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:41,940
because this is an
isothermal process

708
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,580
and it's an ideal gas,

709
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,980
because it's isothermal,

710
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,139
the internal
energy doesn't

711
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,299
change. That's
what we said here.

712
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,939
So the work in

713
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:51,739
there must be equal
to the heat out.

714
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:53,179
So then you have
the heat out.

715
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,380
And so that's the origin

716
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,539
of the first
negative sign.

717
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,259
And that's what
went into here.

718
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:01,219
So then the Q in
minus the Q out.

719
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,619
And we just took
that negative

720
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,859
sign, and we flipped,

721
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,699
what would have been the V

722
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:08,219
three divided
by the V four,

723
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,619
then became V four
divided by V three,

724
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:12,900
and then all
the canceling,

725
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,179
and then you had
to put that, okay?

726
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,480
The other thing that
I will tell you,

727
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,600
Saadi Kara, he did.
This is beautiful.

728
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,879
You look at all of that
and you think, like,

729
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:22,319
that's actually
quite a statement.

730
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,239
So there's two things

731
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,159
that are interesting
to this.

732
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,439
The first is
that he did it

733
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,160
with not
understanding heat.

734
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,399
He did this at a time when

735
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,720
he thought heat
was a substance.

736
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Like, it was called
caloric theory,

737
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
caloric theory,

738
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,359
and later on it

739
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,599
was shown that
it's not, right?

740
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,839
It's basically not had

741
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,294
a lot of weird
ideas back then.

742
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:41,789
Um, but, you know,

743
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:42,790
his math and his thinking

744
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,709
was so consistent that

745
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:44,750
he still produced a result

746
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,029
that actually could stand.

747
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:46,949
But you don't see

748
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:47,909
anything about a
substance here.

749
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:49,110
Of course, in
this derivation,

750
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,430
we did it for
an ideal gas,

751
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,349
but you can get in and

752
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:53,749
show that this statement,

753
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,710
this doesn't depend on

754
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,710
the substance involved.

755
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,269
The efficiency a thermal
engine only depends.

756
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,830
The maximum efficiency

757
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,869
of a thermal engine only

758
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:02,510
depends on the difference

759
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,509
between the temperatures

760
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:04,909
of the heat in and
the heat out, okay?

761
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:06,429
So if you take no
other formula out of

762
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:09,069
this class, This
is it, okay?

763
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:12,549
Seriously. I look back
at my notes from,

764
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:13,909
like, before
coming in today.

765
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:14,589
I looked, you know,

766
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:15,869
I'm not going to
say how long ago,

767
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,030
but I looked at
it and I thought,

768
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,109
I did remember that.
Okay. All right.

769
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:21,829
Cool. So if there's no
questions about that,

770
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:23,829
I think we have
enough time to do.

771
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:26,029
This is kind of an easy

772
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:27,630
that's kind of
an easy one.

773
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,189
I'd prefer to
flex the legs.

774
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:30,550
Well, maybe we
should do easy.

775
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,829
Okay. Maybe maybe

776
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:33,149
we'll do that
one. All right.

777
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:35,309
But as usual, all those
ones you can launch

778
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:37,629
and see and go through.

779
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:39,229
Some might be
interesting and helpful

780
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:41,669
for future homeworks
there, okay?

781
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:51,049
Do do do. All right.

782
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,530
This feels like more of

783
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,649
a permanent marker here.

784
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:56,289
That's not.

785
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:59,289
Oh, man, do, do, do.

786
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,689
All right. That's good.

787
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:18,029
Cool. Alright, so
in this problem,

788
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:21,149
what we're looking at is

789
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:22,669
a refrigeration cycle just

790
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:24,149
to remind you what that
looks like, right?

791
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,270
So you have a
work transfer

792
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,389
that happens to
the compressor.

793
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,629
You take a
refrigerant. One of

794
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:30,789
the most common
is R 134 A.

795
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:32,949
You take that from
a low pressure,

796
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,589
you compress it
to a high one.

797
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,629
You force it to
condense, okay?

798
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:39,950
So you go from like
a rate of vapor.

799
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,710
You condense down
into a liquid,

800
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,869
you transfer heat out.

801
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:44,589
You put that through
an expansion valve,

802
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:45,989
what we call
throttling process,

803
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,830
a big temperature drop.

804
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,029
This causes you
then to produce

805
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:53,510
like a mixture of
liquid and vapor.

806
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,429
And then you evaporate
all the rest of

807
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,070
the basically all the rest

808
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,909
of the liquid there and
do the cooling, okay?

809
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:00,869
But the key part of this

810
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:02,229
is you have a heat out,

811
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:04,629
a heat in, and a
work in there.

812
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:06,950
And what we'd like to
determine are the Q dot

813
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,229
L's and the dot's
and the MDT, okay?

814
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:10,910
And usually in
these systems,

815
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,389
the way that
they're rated is

816
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:13,789
based on the Q
dot L, okay?

817
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:14,669
And they usually set

818
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:15,909
is things like
tons, right?

819
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,269
So how many tons of
ice could you produce,

820
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:20,469
like in an hour are there?

821
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:21,950
So that's kind
of a standard

822
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,749
way that these
are looked at.

823
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:24,749
Okay?

824
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:29,589
All right. So for the
thermal engines, right?

825
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:31,489
We said that All right.

826
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:33,010
And this is not a
thermal engine,

827
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,089
but just to remind
you, right?

828
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:35,249
The thermal engine was the

829
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:36,529
desirable thing
on top, right,

830
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:41,769
O W net out divided
by our Q in, okay?

831
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:44,489
That's how we
rank performance.

832
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,290
For refrigerators,

833
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,529
heat pumps, and
all of that,

834
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:49,969
we talk about a COP,

835
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:54,009
a coefficient of
performance, right?

836
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:56,849
So what's the
desirable thing

837
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:59,460
in a refrigerator?

838
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,029
Besides the beverages
being cold.

839
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:04,789
Yes. So that's it, right?

840
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:08,229
So the desirable thing
there is, right?

841
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:11,509
You want, like, a lot
of Q dot L, all right?

842
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:13,989
And what do you pay?

843
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:16,109
Work in. That's it.

844
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:19,069
Okay? So basically, you
have you have this.

845
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:20,870
If this was a heat pump,

846
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,789
so this is a refrigerator?

847
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,029
This is a refrigerator.

848
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:27,430
All right. If it
was a heat pump,

849
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,029
what would you write
in the numerator?

850
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:31,749
So remember, the whole

851
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:32,909
point of a heat pump is

852
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:36,269
that you want to warm
something up, right?

853
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,829
Cody. So that's it,

854
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:41,150
right? This is not
rocket science.

855
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,229
We will get the
rocket science.

856
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:43,109
No today, though, right?

857
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:45,749
So w.in there, right?

858
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:47,269
So that's refrigerator.

859
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:50,749
And, this would be
heat pump, right?

860
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,629
All right, so we're
interested in this one.

861
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,149
So we're interested
in the refrigerator.

862
00:36:55,149 --> 00:37:00,150
So our desirable is the
Q dot L and the w.in.

863
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,709
As we were told,
the w.in we

864
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:09,709
know is 600 watts.

865
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:13,709
COP is equal to a
terrible value of 1.2.

866
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:17,419
1.2 is like That's
not a good number,

867
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:19,779
but it's a number
for this problem.

868
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,780
And so from this
formula of the COP,

869
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,539
so if I know write my

870
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:26,019
w.in and I know

871
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:27,859
my COP, from this
formula, right?

872
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,459
I can write Q dot
L is equal to

873
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:36,139
w.in times my C COP.

874
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:42,059
So again, 600 watts
times 1.2, okay?

875
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:47,939
And we have that as
a Q dot L, right?

876
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:49,179
So we now know one thing,

877
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:58,259
we know Q dot L. All
right. All right.

878
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:00,379
So as I mentioned, right,

879
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:03,579
in these cycles, to
determine things like,

880
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,139
to determine things
like, for example,

881
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:14,419
the mass transfer we're

882
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:15,219
going to get
into because I

883
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:17,539
know the Q dot L and
I want to get dot,

884
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:18,579
I'm going to need
to figure out,

885
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:19,459
like, what these
states are,

886
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:22,819
essentially what the
enthalpy is of this.

887
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:24,299
So if we look at
the evaporator.

888
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,859
So let me make sure I
have this is state one.

889
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:28,140
State one's 100.

890
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,099
Yeah. So let's look at
this evaporator here.

891
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,729
So this is my All right.

892
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,249
My evaporator
is nothing but,

893
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:35,729
right, like a
heat exchanger.

894
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:38,930
So I have some
MDOT entering.

895
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,609
I have some MDOT
that's leaving, right?

896
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:44,769
It's a steady flow
device. Okay.

897
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,489
Let's call this as
maybe state one.

898
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:48,449
I didn't number it.

899
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:49,850
Yeah. State one is
maybe entering.

900
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,330
State two is exiting,

901
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,129
and we have some
heat that's

902
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:54,889
being transferred
in Q dot L,

903
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:58,134
which we know from there.

904
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:00,619
And what we want
to figure out

905
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:03,859
next is the mass flow
rate, all right?

906
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:06,619
Sure, yeah, mass flow
rate. All right.

907
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,139
So to do that, we

908
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,620
write our conservation
of energy. Alright?

909
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,740
So we say, right,
that DE CV.

910
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,964
So this is my
control volume CV.

911
00:39:16,964 --> 00:39:22,109
Dt is equal to e.in
minus e dot out.

912
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,310
We can also write our
conservation of mass,

913
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,309
dmCv dt is equal to my

914
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:31,149
m.in minus my m
dot out, right?

915
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:33,150
We assume steady
flow conditions,

916
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,429
so these go away.

917
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:37,309
And so what we'll have
then is write m.in

918
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:40,790
is equal to M dot out
is equal to m dot.

919
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,509
And in this case, right,

920
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:46,309
this also implies
that e.in is

921
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:50,129
equal to e dot out, right?

922
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:52,109
I can expand this.

923
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:53,269
So the ways that

924
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:54,589
energy can be
transferred in,

925
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,270
I can have aw.in,

926
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,270
aq.in, and then I
can have an m.in,

927
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,150
which I'm just going
to call as dot.

928
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,509
And I'm going to times
one plus velocity one

929
00:40:04,509 --> 00:40:09,389
squared divided by
two plus g one,

930
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:13,510
and then that's going
to be equal to W dot

931
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,709
out plus Q dot
out plus dot out.

932
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:22,749
Again is dot times
H two plus velocity

933
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:25,369
two squared divided by

934
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,409
two plus GZ two, right?

935
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:30,289
We're going to
neglect, right,

936
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:32,329
kinetic and potential
energy effects, right?

937
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,929
So those are gone. Do we

938
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:37,609
have work transfer
into a heat exchanger?

939
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:42,809
No, workout. I'll
give you this one.

940
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:46,889
No. What about heat in?

941
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:52,319
What do we call
it? Q dot L. Okay.

942
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,599
What about heat
out? No, right?

943
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,839
So essentially, then
our Q dot L, right?

944
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,199
So this Q dot L
is equal to m

945
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,919
dot times H two
minus rh one.

946
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,199
Again, we would like
to find this dot.

947
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,639
We know Q dot L. We need

948
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,759
to figure out two and one.

949
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:15,119
Right? So for state
one state one,

950
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,719
what do we know
about state one?

951
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:20,879
So state one is entering
the evaporator.

952
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:25,840
What's the
pressure? 100 kp,

953
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,919
and our quality X
one is equal to two.

954
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,960
With Pi kiloor in tables,

955
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,799
you can look this up
and get to your H

956
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:37,519
one value for state two.

957
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:44,399
So I'd say Pi kiloor
H one equals a value.

958
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:48,779
Um and state two,
what do I know?

959
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:51,579
I know, again, the
pressure P one is

960
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,420
equal P two is equal

961
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,059
to P one because

962
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:55,299
it's a heat
exchanger, right?

963
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:56,939
Heat exchanges are
isobaric, right?

964
00:41:56,939 --> 00:41:58,500
We don't have
pressure drops.

965
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,739
In this class,
we don't have

966
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:02,379
pressure drops across
heat exchangers.

967
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:04,140
And we know the
temperature,

968
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,259
the temperature is
given T two is equal to

969
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:13,539
negative 26 degrees
Celsius, right?

970
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:14,819
And it's fair to ask

971
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:15,899
yourself what's
going to be

972
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:18,819
the state of the
vapor there?

973
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:19,979
I mean, in this case,

974
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:21,139
we could look
it up and see,

975
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,860
but it's most likely

976
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,499
either a saturated
vapor or

977
00:42:24,499 --> 00:42:26,460
potentially a
superheated vapor.

978
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,259
There, right?

979
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:29,219
But the point is
that presumably

980
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,739
from these two pieces
of information,

981
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:33,499
we then also know
H two, again,

982
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:36,859
from Pi color, right?

983
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:39,299
So with those two
things no, right?

984
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:41,420
We can substitute
into this formula,

985
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,099
and we'll
rearrange, right?

986
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:46,740
So dot is equal to
Q dot L divided

987
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,459
by H two minus
H one, right?

988
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,999
And what's my value?
The value that

989
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:58,919
I have for my MDOT

990
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:07,800
is 0.004 1
kilogram/second.

991
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,440
Yeah, that's like
a small fridge.

992
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,759
That's like your
fridge at home

993
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,319
is probably that size.

994
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,999
Okay. The final part then,

995
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:21,320
so we know Q dot
L, we know dot.

996
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,719
And now we can figure
out Q dot H, right?

997
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,079
And the way that
we can figure out

998
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,600
Q dot H is to draw,

999
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,400
again, a control volume

1000
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,560
around the entire device.

1001
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,999
So let's say this
is my whole,

1002
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:42,239
you know, my whole
device here.

1003
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,400
Okay, it looks like
this. Horribly drawn.

1004
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,719
Right at the Q dot

1005
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:48,979
H. All right,
which is out.

1006
00:43:48,979 --> 00:43:50,899
I have a Q dot L,

1007
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:54,260
which is here,
and I have aw.in.

1008
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,619
If I go in, I draw

1009
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:58,339
my control volume. You
know, I don't know.

1010
00:43:58,339 --> 00:43:59,619
Let's say I draw
it like this

1011
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:06,219
around the entire system.

1012
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:09,539
You can look at
this and say,

1013
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,419
you know, write the
first law here.

1014
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:15,459
So if we say for the
first law is that,

1015
00:44:15,459 --> 00:44:21,299
um, Oh, my gosh.

1016
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:23,499
What we're going to
end up with here

1017
00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:25,299
is that the change,

1018
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:27,499
right, in the energy
of the system has

1019
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,699
to be zero in its
steady state, right?

1020
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:31,899
So the energy that I
transfer in must be

1021
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:32,980
equal to the energy

1022
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,299
that's transferred
out, right?

1023
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,779
So Q dot H is what's

1024
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:37,899
leaving and what's
entering is

1025
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:42,859
then my w.in plus
my Q dot L, right?

1026
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:45,659
And the w.in was
a given, right?

1027
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:49,779
So that's 600
watts, the Q dot L,

1028
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:55,910
um, We just determined,

1029
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,229
which was over there,
that was, like,

1030
00:44:57,229 --> 00:44:59,709
the first thing that we
did plus that number.

1031
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:01,069
And so what I
have at the end

1032
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:03,149
of this is one, three,

1033
00:45:03,149 --> 00:45:10,369
two, zero watts is then
the Q dot H. Okay?

1034
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:13,069
Yeah. And I

1035
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:14,509
think one of the
things I always like,

1036
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:16,229
wrap your head around

1037
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:18,069
with this is that
you are able, right?

1038
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:19,309
So the whole point of

1039
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:21,669
the COP here is
that you're able to

1040
00:45:21,669 --> 00:45:25,149
transfer move more heat

1041
00:45:25,149 --> 00:45:27,309
than the work you
put in, okay?

1042
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:28,949
It seems like a

1043
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:30,469
violation of the
first law, right?

1044
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:31,669
So I put like one unit of

1045
00:45:31,669 --> 00:45:33,389
electricity in, and
I'm able to pump,

1046
00:45:33,389 --> 00:45:34,629
let's say, in this case,

1047
00:45:34,629 --> 00:45:37,749
1.2 units of heat from
the cold reservoir.

1048
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:40,019
I The way to know
that it's not

1049
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:41,299
a violation is
to first just

1050
00:45:41,299 --> 00:45:42,939
look at the
first law, okay?

1051
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:44,379
So everything, you know,

1052
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:45,219
about that is possible.

1053
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:46,739
I'm able to,
you know, move,

1054
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:48,739
absorb more q dot L

1055
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:51,220
here for an
amount of w.in.

1056
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,899
For this to work, though,

1057
00:45:52,899 --> 00:45:55,139
the sum of those two
components in has

1058
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:57,419
to equal the heat that
leaves, all right?

1059
00:45:57,419 --> 00:45:58,779
And that's why,
again, the back of

1060
00:45:58,779 --> 00:46:00,659
a fridge is very
warm and all of

1061
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:02,379
that because
you have a lot

1062
00:46:02,379 --> 00:46:04,540
of heat to reject.

1063
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,099
But there's many scenarios

1064
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,819
where this makes a lot
of sense, you know?

1065
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:10,620
So if you think about
electrification,

1066
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,859
you want to electrify
so this again,

1067
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:14,139
this is on the
refrigeration side,

1068
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,019
but if you want
to run that

1069
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:16,144
as like a heat pump,

1070
00:46:16,144 --> 00:46:18,509
So again, you can look
at that as an example.

1071
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,749
So here's an example of

1072
00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:21,909
that. Water heater, right?

1073
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:23,389
So you could take, like,

1074
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:25,669
a resistor, take
electricity,

1075
00:46:25,669 --> 00:46:27,469
heat the water
directly, right?

1076
00:46:27,469 --> 00:46:29,069
That's first law,
though, right?

1077
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:30,469
So I put electricity in,

1078
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:31,749
I transfer work in.

1079
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:33,510
All of that then becomes

1080
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,630
heat for warming
this device.

1081
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,414
But that's one
to one, right?

1082
00:46:38,414 --> 00:46:40,159
The point with the
heat pump, though,

1083
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,799
is I can take one
unit of work in,

1084
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,119
and I can move
in several units

1085
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:46,000
of heat into the
water heater.

1086
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,919
And that's the
whole reason

1087
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:48,519
why heat pump technologies

1088
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,879
are very competitive
is because they just,

1089
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,719
like, I mean, it's
a no brainer.

1090
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:55,320
You don't even need
to know thermo.

1091
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,520
You do need to
know thermo,

1092
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,279
but you don't really

1093
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,440
need to understand thermo

1094
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,839
to get the fact that for

1095
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,119
the same dollar
that I pay,

1096
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,480
I can have three units

1097
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,999
of the same quality
of heat, right?

1098
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:06,119
You're just
going to install

1099
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,240
that capital costs

1100
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,519
and other things
notwithstanding,

1101
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,470
alright? Cool.
It's Friday.

1102
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,629
I feel like I rain
you through a lot.

1103
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:16,509
So I'm basically
going to close it.

1104
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:18,389
I'm going to
close it here.

1105
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:19,869
If you have any
questions, for

1106
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:21,470
example, not
about the quiz.

1107
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,349
I'm just kidding.
Maybe quiz, too.

1108
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,989
Feel free to come up.

1109
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:25,189
Otherwise, have
a great weekend,

1110
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:28,789
everyone. Oh.
