1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Wonderful. So today, we

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,520
continue with vapor
power cycles.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,000
So after today, you're

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,280
going to be
able to analyze

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,160
a reheat vapor
power cycle and

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
a regenerative
vapor power cycle.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,359
I've already
introduced you to

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,199
regeneration
in the context

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,479
of a Braden cycle.

10
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,000
We're going to do it
today in the context

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,999
of a closed loop
rankin cycle, okay?

12
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:27,479
Before I get
into that, since

13
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,929
you As about Quiz two,

14
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,329
what I will note is
that the practice

15
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,970
quiz is already online.

16
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,809
This is what I
ran last year.

17
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:36,249
Last year, at this point,

18
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,249
what I asked was an
entry be generation,

19
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:40,009
an ideal Humphries cycle,

20
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,249
which is a great cycle.

21
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,289
It's a detonation
engine, super good.

22
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,410
Then the ideal
Ericsson cycle.

23
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,689
Ericsson is Sterling is

24
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:55,290
a piston cylinder device.

25
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,449
Basically the
most efficient

26
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,169
piston cylinder device
you could have.

27
00:00:58,169 --> 00:00:59,489
Ericsson is the most

28
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,409
efficient steady
flow device

29
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,490
you could have
for an engine.

30
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,739
I'll continue to
add more as I find

31
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,219
5 minutes and
10 minutes in

32
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,699
my day to have
problems, right?

33
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:14,059
Okay, so, David,
last time,

34
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:16,059
well, I don't see him,

35
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,139
had brought up this point

36
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,659
about how can
we think about

37
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,180
improving the efficiency
of a ranking cycle?

38
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,979
There are several
ways one can do this.

39
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,849
So one, which
I show here is

40
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,570
essentially reducing

41
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,730
the pressure in
the condenser.

42
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,249
So if you think about what

43
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:39,529
our system looks
like, right?

44
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:40,809
We have this boiler, okay?

45
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,049
So we have q.in,
which is here, right?

46
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:48,449
Steam comes out at
some state here.

47
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:52,870
We put this
into a turbine.

48
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,349
Okay. You know, here
we expand that.

49
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,190
We then put that into
a surface condenser.

50
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,750
So many, many tubes
where water condenses.

51
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,789
And then this goes back

52
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,029
into a pump where we have

53
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:06,789
aw.in to a pump. Okay?

54
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,069
And then this goes
back into the boiler.

55
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:12,670
So this is where our
Q dot out happens.

56
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,069
This is where our shaft

57
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,150
work out happens, right?

58
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,590
And so what sets

59
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,510
the pressure in
the condenser?

60
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,590
So again, this
condenser right?

61
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,190
I can draw like kind of
a side view of this.

62
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,270
So if I was showing this
as like a side view,

63
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,140
the way that this works,

64
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,170
is that you have steam

65
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,730
that comes into the top of

66
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,849
this thing from
the turbine

67
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,409
and then exits
as a liquid.

68
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:36,530
Remember, this great

69
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,810
discussion from, you know,

70
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,850
Ben in the last
lecture about what

71
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,130
a condensed
state is and how

72
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,770
we define it, right?

73
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,689
So you have a quality

74
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:45,769
here that's equal to zero.

75
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,450
It comes out
of liquid, and

76
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,329
it comes as a
superheated vapor.

77
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,770
And the way that
we condense is we

78
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,530
have many tubes, right?

79
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,810
This is one version of it.

80
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,469
You have like many tubes.

81
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,370
I'm not really
showing that many,

82
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,329
where we're
bringing, let's say,

83
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,689
cooling water in at
some temperature.

84
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,250
So maybe this is like a T,

85
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,850
you know, five coming in,

86
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,370
and maybe this is a T
six that's coming out,

87
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,730
and it's a liquid, right?

88
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,370
A lot of this is

89
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,610
groundwater that
we bring in,

90
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,330
we pass through, right,

91
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,329
and it exits this system.

92
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,129
And then on the outside
of these tubes,

93
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,290
this is where water
condenses, right?

94
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,689
So water is going
to condense on

95
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:24,370
the outside of these
tubes, all right?

96
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,490
And then it's
going to when the

97
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,649
droplets are big enough,

98
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:27,850
it's going to start
to, you know,

99
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,920
drip down and
drain into here.

100
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,310
So what sets, there's
a lot of. Okay.

101
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,910
So what's going to set

102
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,310
the pressure that's in

103
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,949
there is the temperature,

104
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,030
because this is a saturated
condition, right?

105
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,230
I have a mixture of
vapor and liquid.

106
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,270
And so this something,

107
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,110
let's say between T
five and T six. Okay?

108
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,150
So let's say, you know,

109
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,909
we have some temperature

110
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,550
that's the average,
I don't know,

111
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,510
T five plus T six,
you know, there.

112
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,229
So we have some
temperature like that.

113
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,400
The lower Let's say
that you make this,

114
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,880
and then the lower will be

115
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,000
the saturation vapor
pressure that's there.

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,559
So the colder
that I get that,

117
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,799
the colder or the
lower then will be

118
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,679
the pressure that I

119
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,679
have then inside
of that condenser.

120
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,240
Alright? What it means

121
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,079
is since the workout
of this device,

122
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,159
what's the workout of
a steady flow device?

123
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,519
What's the shaft work
going to be equal to?

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:42,240
AV, Alex.

125
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,879
Okay.

126
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,839
Now, David is here.
You moved on me.

127
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,000
So what's the workout

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,719
of a steady flow device?

129
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,279
So piston cylinder,
it's PDV.

130
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,560
What is it as steady flow?

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
Don't make me ask
Melanie. She's behind.

132
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,279
H.

133
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,520
No, not H. It could
be H. It could be DH,

134
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,839
yes. But what's
another way, right?

135
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,319
So if I talked
about a shaft work,

136
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,799
I could say PDV when

137
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,480
it was a piston
cylinder device.

138
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,959
And when I talked about
a steady flow device,

139
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,519
it's isochoric, but I

140
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,399
have a pressure
difference across it.

141
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,934
So the V is constant.

142
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:16,789
So V times,
that's it, right?

143
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,070
So you have a specific
volume there, right?

144
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,229
I have, let's say,
if this is one,

145
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,309
two, three, four, so one,

146
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:28,189
two, three, and then
four is a state,

147
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,629
then what you're
going to have is

148
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,709
P three minus P four.

149
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,589
So the reason why you
get more work out of

150
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:35,590
this make the
temperature lower,

151
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,829
you make the
pressure, right?

152
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:40,470
P or P four,
they're lower.

153
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,285
So you have a bigger
Delta P, right?

154
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,700
That's one way to make
it more efficient.

155
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,580
What actually happens
in power plants,

156
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,739
though, is the other way.

157
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:52,059
You start off pristine.
Everything is great.

158
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:55,100
And these pipes corrode,
they get fouled.

159
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,539
And what it means
is that the outside

160
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:57,899
of these tubes get warmer.

161
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,339
It means the
pressure goes up,

162
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,779
the Delta P less.

163
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,059
It means you get
less workout.

164
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,259
They call that derating
de rating, okay?

165
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,339
And it's not a small
amount of energy.

166
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,420
It's not a small
amount. It's measuring

167
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,499
like several percent
power plants.

168
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,099
You put that on
a global scale.

169
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,139
It's a lot of energy.

170
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,539
It's a lot of extra
CO two emissions.

171
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:19,959
It's a lot, okay?
So you can try to,

172
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,639
you know, make
this colder.

173
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,359
That's why you can
use water. Water will

174
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,720
get you to a lower
temperature.

175
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,880
Other ones will use air.

176
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,159
So sometimes you'll
see, you know,

177
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,160
maybe they'll blow air

178
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,200
and try to reject heat.

179
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,679
It depends on where
you're located.

180
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:33,240
But my gut would
say that with air,

181
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,359
you're probably not
going to get to

182
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,880
a lower temperature
compared to

183
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,029
something like water
water cooled, okay?

184
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,699
Great. So that's
what it is, right?

185
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:41,980
So I get to
lower pressure,

186
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,699
and then because of that,

187
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,819
I'm going to
have that extra

188
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,340
area within my loop.

189
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,980
The area enclosed
in that loop is,

190
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,139
of course, the net Q in,

191
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,259
which for a cycle is

192
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,939
the network
out, all right?

193
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:56,219
Other way we can
do it is, right?

194
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:57,139
You can just simply

195
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,459
go to higher temperatures.

196
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,780
We talked about
that before,

197
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,099
but there's
limits to this.

198
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:02,969
So if you think about
a rank in cycle,

199
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,680
What limits the
temperature

200
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,119
and the pressure
here is the boiler.

201
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,440
How stable can
I make that?

202
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,240
That's like, the first
thing. So how hot?

203
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,960
How much pressure
can this handle?

204
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,399
The second thing is, will

205
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,199
my blades melt, right?

206
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Will I be able to run

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,719
a steam or something
through that

208
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:20,399
that doesn't absolutely
destroy my system?

209
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,119
So the combination
of those two things,

210
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,720
I believe it's the boilers

211
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,599
that actually
set the limit

212
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:25,959
at the moment for water.

213
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,919
But there will be
an upper limit

214
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,520
that you can handle,
and that will be set.

215
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,599
Okay, but there's
another approach, okay?

216
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,600
So if we say that the
materials and all

217
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,549
of that can handle only,

218
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:40,869
you know, an upper
pressure and

219
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,869
an upper temperature
associated with them.

220
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,989
One thing you can do is to

221
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:47,349
run what's called
a rank and reheat.

222
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:49,389
So essentially, you take

223
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,029
the steam leaving the
original turbine,

224
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,669
as I would show in
State four here,

225
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:55,629
and you run it through

226
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,269
the boiler again, okay?

227
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,229
So you run it through
the boiler again,

228
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,069
that comes back out,

229
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:02,389
and you run it then
through that enters

230
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,070
in a lower
pressure turbine,

231
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,909
and you try to

232
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:07,429
eke more work out
of it that way.

233
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:08,589
So this process is called

234
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,350
a reheat, a
reheat process.

235
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,870
Okay? We talked
about regeneration,

236
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,269
which I'll do in
the next example.

237
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:16,504
This one is a reheat
there, right?

238
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:18,579
And hopefully it's clear

239
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:19,699
why you would do that from

240
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,059
a TS diagram, right?

241
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:21,859
So here I went to

242
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,500
that higher pressure
and temperature.

243
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,979
I dropped it down, right,

244
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,700
with my work extraction

245
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,939
until I was a
saturated vapor,

246
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:30,459
and then I
reheated it again.

247
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,260
But this pressure is
going to be lower.

248
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,180
P five here is going to
be less than P three.

249
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,540
I'm showing the
isobars here,

250
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,180
but it still
has that upper

251
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,260
temperature limit
with it, right?

252
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,340
I that boiler,
I'm not going

253
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,420
to get a higher
temperature.

254
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,740
I can only get the
max temperature

255
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,020
again, and then it
drops back down.

256
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,660
But you have that
extra, you know,

257
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,500
slice of area
enclosing that curve,

258
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,100
and that gives you
a boost, okay?

259
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,169
So let's reheat reheat.

260
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:53,840
All right. So
what I'm going to

261
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,720
do now is I'll go
through this analysis.

262
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,240
We'll go through the
analysis of this one.

263
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,879
How do you do reheat.

264
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,230
Yeah, and the work
that's in my lab,

265
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,910
we work basically
on coatings and

266
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,790
stuff to prevent
fouling that

267
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,550
happens on the
inside of these and

268
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,789
corrosion on the
inside of these tubes.

269
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:18,710
So if you're
ever interested

270
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,790
in seeing that,
let me know.

271
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,630
I can put you
in contact with

272
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,990
the researchers who
actually do the work.

273
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,349
Okay. All right, so
the ideal reheat.

274
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:33,909
Let me see. This one's

275
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,830
still okay? It's okay ish.

276
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,589
I Alright, so what
do we have here?

277
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:40,390
So we have first,

278
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,950
we have our pump.

279
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,870
So we have a pump
that's here.

280
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,190
This is going
into our boiler,

281
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,390
which looks like this.

282
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,270
This goes out, and then

283
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,350
into a high pressure
turbine, just like that.

284
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,950
This is connected
in series then to

285
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,709
a low pressure turbine,

286
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:02,830
which looks like that.

287
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,670
And then this is
my W dot out,

288
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,830
which is happening there.

289
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,420
This enters
into The boiler

290
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
here goes back out
and then becomes

291
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,619
the inlet to the low
pressure turbine.

292
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,980
Exit of this then

293
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,979
passes through the
surface condenser,

294
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:25,179
just like the one that
I showed you, right?

295
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:28,580
And then this goes back
into the pump, right?

296
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,269
So this has aw.in Here,

297
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:36,350
we have aq.in,
which is here.

298
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,030
We have the W dot
out, which is there,

299
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,630
and we have a Q dot out,

300
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,469
which is happening
from the condenser.

301
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:45,630
We label states,
the state at

302
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,350
the exit of the
condenser is state one,

303
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,990
State two is
entering the boiler.

304
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,150
State three is
exiting the boiler.

305
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,664
This is just as we
did for Rankin.

306
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,420
State four is the exiting

307
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,379
of the first turbine,

308
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:00,260
and then this is where we

309
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,420
start to have differences.

310
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
State five is then at

311
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,900
the exit of the
reheat process.

312
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,419
State six is then at

313
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,739
the exit of the low
pressure turbine.

314
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,220
So one, two, three,
four, five, six,

315
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,659
so two additional
states to do reheat.

316
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:21,420
All right? What are we
given in the problem?

317
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,500
So we can start with
our state five.

318
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,070
It's a state Um,
our state five.

319
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,590
So we're told four
or state three.

320
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,630
Let's start with
State three.

321
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,870
State three is
given, right?

322
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,830
So our state three,
we know that we

323
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,950
have a T three that's

324
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,349
equal to 315
degrees Celsius,

325
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:44,990
and we have a P three
that's equal to

326
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,070
4.14 MPA, all right?

327
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,149
And that's the nor, right?

328
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,149
So you typically in

329
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,310
these problems are
going to be given

330
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,789
the exit state
of the boiler.

331
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,710
That's like
automatic, all right?

332
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,470
And out of this,
all right,

333
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,579
um, Well, of course,

334
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,980
no specific

335
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,620
enthropy and specific
entropy there.

336
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,900
It's a pure substance,

337
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,340
two pieces of two
independent properties

338
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,740
because it's a
superheated vapor,

339
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,020
temperature and
pressure work,

340
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,940
so we have complete
knowledge there.

341
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,900
All right. Next
thing that's given.

342
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,640
We can get to state I'm

343
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,080
going to go to
state five here.

344
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,800
Okay. And state five,

345
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,799
again, essentially
exit of the boiler.

346
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:31,400
We know that T five
here is 315 degrees C,

347
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,080
just like T three
because it's

348
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,040
passing through
the same boiler.

349
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,280
But the pressure is
going to be less, right,

350
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,079
because this has
already passed through,

351
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:39,520
right?

352
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,719
It's expanded through

353
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,999
the um first turbine here,

354
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:44,639
so the pressure is
going to be less.

355
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,720
P five is going to be
less than P three,

356
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,880
and the pressure we're
told here is 1.38 PA.

357
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,600
And the same,
we know H five,

358
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,240
and we know S five
there. All right.

359
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,800
Good what else do we know?

360
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,670
Basically, state
six, State six,

361
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,230
we're told the pressure at

362
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,270
the exit of the
second turbine,

363
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,669
the low pressure turbine,

364
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:22,990
that's 0.069 PA.

365
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,400
Okay, Good.

366
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,920
And so what we
can do is we can

367
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,279
go device by device,

368
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,280
essentially do our mass,

369
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,639
energy and
entropy analysis

370
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,719
for these individual
control volumes.

371
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,440
From that, we'll
be able to say

372
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,520
things like how much
energy is in or out,

373
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,680
how much entropy
changes with that.

374
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,199
And then with
those parameters,

375
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,719
we'll come back to states.

376
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,400
And then once we
have the states,

377
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,519
we'll have our enthalpies.

378
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,440
We'll go back and
substitute numbers and

379
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,560
be able to say
how much heat

380
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,720
was added or rejected,

381
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
and then the thermal
efficiency of the cycle.

382
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,960
So let's start drawing
some control volumes.

383
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,290
Alright. Okay. All right,

384
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,930
so our first one
is with our pump.

385
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,170
So we have a control
volume for our pump.

386
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,569
We have our control
volume for the boiler,

387
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:21,289
control volume for
high pressure turbine,

388
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:25,570
control volume for
low pressure turbine,

389
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,289
and then the
control volume

390
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:29,050
for the condenser.

391
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:35,090
All right. Do do
do. All right.

392
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,689
So if we go with our pump,

393
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:43,979
so if we start with one
to two, and our pump.

394
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:45,940
So we have work in.

395
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,819
So we have

396
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,660
a steady flow device for
all of these, right?

397
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,380
Delta M, CV is equal
to zero, Delta E,

398
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,540
CV is equal to
zero, and Delta S,

399
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,820
CV is equal to
zero for all

400
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,260
of these devices, right?

401
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,100
So for the pump, we
only have work in,

402
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,660
okay? We're
neglecting, right?

403
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,419
So Delta KE is
equal to Delta PE,

404
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:16,980
which is equal to zero for

405
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,300
all these devices,
all right?

406
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,020
And so what you'll
have then is,

407
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,660
um, All right,

408
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,180
m.in equals M dot
out equals to m dot.

409
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,740
And so for here, the work

410
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,499
that's going to go
in is then going to

411
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:33,740
be H two minus
H one, right?

412
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,620
If we do an entropy
balance here,

413
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,940
I'll do it for this
one, and then I'll

414
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,260
just skip through it
for the others, right?

415
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:48,020
But ds cv dt is equal
to.in minus rs dot out,

416
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:54,060
S dot out plus rs dot gen.

417
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,740
So steady flow device?

418
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,485
So this is gone.

419
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:00,150
Um, and because this is

420
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,829
an ideal reheat
rank and cycle,

421
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,509
what that means for
work transfer processes

422
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:06,149
is that these are

423
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:07,870
adiabatic and
they're reversible.

424
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,950
So what do you think that

425
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,190
means for this formula?

426
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,070
What simplification
do I make if I

427
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,630
have something that's

428
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,110
adiabatic and reversible,

429
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,150
Zs dot gen is gone, right?

430
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,190
And so the reason for
this is adiabatic.

431
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,030
And reversible
reversible, all right?

432
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,430
And the keyword for

433
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,710
this for work
transfer things

434
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,710
is that you see the
word ideal, okay?

435
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,390
So ideal means that

436
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,790
work transfer devices
are isentropic.

437
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,350
And the meaning of
isentropic is that

438
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,070
it's adiabatic
and reversible.

439
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,790
Adiabatic means no
heat in or out.

440
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,669
Reversible means,
as I run it,

441
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,470
I don't generate
friction, right?

442
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,430
Essentially, I don't
generate heat.

443
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,205
That's the meaning
of that, all right?

444
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:51,860
Okay, so out of this,

445
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,220
right, I can write M dot.

446
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,660
N is dot out, right?

447
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,820
So.in times little S N

448
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,340
is equal to my dot out
times little S out.

449
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,980
M.in is M dot out,
right, that's gone.

450
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,099
And so what it means
is S in is S out.

451
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,619
So S one is equal to

452
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,179
little S one is equal
to little S two, okay?

453
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,259
So now we know
something about state,

454
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:20,339
um Right?

455
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,499
Now we know basically
something about

456
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:28,899
state state two, right?

457
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:32,899
So we have here state
can write state two.

458
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:37,419
So here I'm saying S
two is equal to S one,

459
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:43,769
okay? Great. All right.

460
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,609
On to our next device.

461
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,210
So I will not
go as detailed

462
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,449
for the next one,

463
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:50,849
but for the next
one, two to three.

464
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:54,330
So I'm looking at
my control volume.

465
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,210
Maybe I should spend

466
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,009
a little bit more
time with that.

467
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:02,049
So now we have two or

468
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,689
what I would call
essentially what is it?

469
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:06,530
It's two to three,
and then it's

470
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,609
also four to
five, all right?

471
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,690
Four to five
is the boiler.

472
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,770
All right, so I look
at the control volume.

473
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,009
It's steady flow, right?

474
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:19,370
MDT in is MDT out of
that control volume.

475
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,850
And so We have the dot,

476
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,890
the way that energy
is entering,

477
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,410
I have dot times two plus

478
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,010
m dot times H four
must be equal

479
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:40,929
to plus.in q.in is

480
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,330
then equal to the
way that it exits.

481
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,704
Mm dot times three,

482
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:50,239
plus dot times H

483
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:56,439
five to do we're not

484
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,759
going to do we're
not going to do

485
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,679
an entropy analysis
on the boiler here.

486
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,640
Good. What's next?

487
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,080
Let me just
check my notes,

488
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,919
make sure I'm on track.

489
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:23,439
Do. Other questions
so far? Mmm.

490
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,799
Okay. We can write this

491
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,680
in for the rate

492
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,280
of heat addition
and heat rejection.

493
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,079
What I have in my
solution is we solve for.

494
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,679
So what I can do
is I can divide

495
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,039
both sides by dot.

496
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
If I did that, I'll have H

497
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,039
two plus four plus
little Q in, right?

498
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:48,479
So heat per unit mass is

499
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,159
then equal to H
three plus H five.

500
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,399
So then little Q in
is then equal to

501
00:19:54,399 --> 00:20:03,359
H three plus five
minus H two plus four.

502
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,559
I swear I read this thing,

503
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,435
and then geez
too many pages.

504
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:28,549
Yeah, H three plus

505
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,589
H five minus H
two minus H four.

506
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,550
Okay, that's great.
So that's good.

507
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,749
Now we can go on to
more familiar things.

508
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:40,430
So then three to
five is our turbine.

509
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,429
So we have no work in.

510
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:44,229
We have no heat in or out,

511
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:45,469
neglecting changes in

512
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:46,790
potential kinetic energy.

513
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,469
So W dot out of
our turbine is

514
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:54,189
dot times this is
three to four,

515
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:56,829
sorry, three to
43 to four H

516
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:00,229
three minus H four.

517
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:03,589
That's very good.
The second turbine.

518
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:05,390
So our next turbine,

519
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,229
which is then
five to four.

520
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:11,790
So we have five to six.

521
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,069
If there's questions.

522
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,899
Okay. Five to six.

523
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,380
So then the W dot

524
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,939
out of this lower
pressure turbine,

525
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:29,459
maybe I'll call
it I don't know.

526
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:30,699
Maybe I can call that two,

527
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:32,099
maybe I'll call that one.

528
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,979
But the W dot out
of this one is

529
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:41,059
then m.h5 minus six.

530
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,539
What we can do for both of

531
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,020
these cases is also
the entropy analysis.

532
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,820
So no change in the
control volume,

533
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,379
adiabatic reversible
because it's ideal.

534
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:50,900
So what it means then is

535
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,339
the same thing
here, S four.

536
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,779
Little four is going

537
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:56,259
to be equal to
little S three,

538
00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:59,219
and the same for the
other one little S

539
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:01,059
six is going to be

540
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,179
equal to little S
five there, right?

541
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,980
So that's isomropic.

542
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,580
And then our last one
is then our condenser.

543
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,859
So it's condenser.

544
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:12,139
We don't have
work in or out.

545
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:13,059
We have no heat in.

546
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,539
We only have
heat out, right?

547
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,859
So we do our then
this is six to one.

548
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:22,499
So six to one,
our condenser,

549
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:25,899
our Q dot out is
going to be equal to

550
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:29,699
M dot times the
enthalpy at state six,

551
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:34,339
a six minus the enthalpy
at state one, okay?

552
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:40,729
Great. Let us I

553
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:43,769
will move this to
this side here.

554
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:48,370
I will bring back
my estates here,

555
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,690
and I will move this
one into the middle.

556
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,569
And now we can go bit by

557
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:55,210
bit and map out
our estates,

558
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:55,930
now that we have

559
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,490
enough information
there, alright?

560
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,529
Okay, so we have
State three,

561
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,129
which we know this is
an important part of

562
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,249
analyzing these things is

563
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:08,850
figuring out

564
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,889
where you have
complete information.

565
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,489
So you start from
these points.

566
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:12,010
Alright,

567
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,690
so it's state three
entering the turbine.

568
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,009
I'm I'm good there.

569
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:18,609
I go down to state four.

570
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:22,529
So state State four.

571
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:25,050
I know that this turbine

572
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,769
operates
isentropically, right?

573
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:33,649
So, S is equal to S three.

574
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,690
Trying to see
how that looks.

575
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,929
Maybe I'll go full
screen here. All right.

576
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,689
And as far as S three,

577
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:42,769
what else do you think
you know about State

578
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:44,290
four based on
what I've drawn

579
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,409
here? Hazard a guess.

580
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,610
Quality, no, Cody.

581
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,450
Sure. That's
it. Look ahead.

582
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,690
Look backwards, but
also look forwards.

583
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,729
Normally, I say don't
look backwards in life,

584
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:01,850
but in Rankin, look

585
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,849
backwards and forwards
like Cody said.

586
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,849
Basically, your
pressure here because

587
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:08,810
you're passing through
a heat exchanger,

588
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,689
P four is equal

589
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:13,529
to P five and P
five is given.

590
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:19,209
This is equal to 1.38 PA.

591
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,209
This is good. Now I know

592
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:26,049
my or I know my four here.

593
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,290
That's good. State
five is given.

594
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,089
We come to state six now.

595
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:34,489
State six from
what we wrote

596
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:39,569
over there is that S
is equal to S five.

597
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:43,209
So S is equal to S five,

598
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:44,889
and S five, we
determined here.

599
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:46,649
So now you have
complete information.

600
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:48,330
You can get the enthalpy

601
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,649
at state six for this.

602
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:53,849
We're good.
Continuing along,

603
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:57,169
now we're at we're
at state one.

604
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:03,059
This is State State one.

605
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,619
At state one, because

606
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,659
a condenser is a
glorified heat exchanger,

607
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,740
P one is equal to
P six is equal to

608
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,739
0.069 PA. That's good.

609
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:21,619
What else do you know
about the condenser?

610
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:30,169
Yeah. Elias. And the
quality is zero.

611
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:32,129
That's it, right? The
quality is zero here.

612
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:33,650
So X one is equal

613
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,210
to zero because
it's a condenser.

614
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,370
That's a part
about a Rankin.

615
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,409
Okay, I remember that.

616
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:38,809
And with this, you have

617
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:41,329
S one and you have H one.

618
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:42,889
So now I have state one,

619
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,810
okay? Continuing along.

620
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,049
I'm looking at it. I got

621
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,649
three, four, five, six.

622
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:48,889
I almost got a bingo here.

623
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:50,449
Actually, that
I have a bingo,

624
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,130
but I need an extra
one for a reheat.

625
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,249
So the last part is
that I know an OS one

626
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:57,929
at state two
because the pump

627
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:00,729
operates isentropically.

628
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:02,409
I know this um

629
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,009
a specific entropy
at state two.

630
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:06,809
And like Cody had said,

631
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:08,770
because of boiler is
a heat exchanger,

632
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,890
I know that P two,
if I look ahead,

633
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,169
is equal to P three,
and that's a given.

634
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:16,449
That's given as 4.14

635
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,809
PA. And so what

636
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:21,409
that means is that
I have H two.

637
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:26,489
Right? So all I
need to determine

638
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:28,890
the heat additions
and the heat

639
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,649
and the heat
rejections, I've got.

640
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:37,999
So I've got my I guess
going in order, right?

641
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,679
I have H one, right?

642
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,479
I have my age two, I
have my age three,

643
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,239
I have my age four,

644
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,839
I have my age five,

645
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,159
and I have my
age six, okay?

646
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:52,279
So let's get into it.
We're given the power.

647
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:58,239
So we're given
that the w.net,

648
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:01,119
which is equal to the w.in

649
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,159
minus the W dot out,

650
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,750
um, which is, of course,

651
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,070
also equal to q.in,

652
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,869
I'm sorry, W dot out.

653
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,469
Excuse me. It's
Friday W dot out.

654
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:19,749
W dot N is equal to
q.in minus Q dot out,

655
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:23,789
which is equal to 5
megawatts, right?

656
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:26,789
5 megawatts. All right.

657
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:30,739
I This is good.

658
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:40,379
This means that I have
dot times little W out

659
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:44,540
minus little W
in is equal to

660
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:52,659
the dot of Q in
minus little Q out.

661
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:00,719
Okay, um, four.

662
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,359
So it depends on
what we could do.

663
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,519
I would say, in this case,

664
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,639
since it's asking
us for the

665
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,080
heat addition
and rejection,

666
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,959
we can focus on the Q in.

667
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:16,879
So our Q in was an
dot times what?

668
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,879
Our little Q in we
wrote over there

669
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:21,759
was not an M dot.

670
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,919
It was H three plus H

671
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:31,119
five minus H two
plus H four.

672
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,079
I've got that.
That's good.

673
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,399
The little Q
out All right.

674
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,079
Where do we write it?

675
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:44,479
That would be H
six minus H one.

676
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,559
Okay? That's good.

677
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,719
So now what you
would do is

678
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,039
substitute those
values use

679
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,879
Pi calorie. You
got those values.

680
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,519
You'll take this Q in,

681
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,880
you'll put it into here,

682
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,319
you'll take this Q out,

683
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,559
you'll put it into
here, you'll set this

684
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:02,399
equal to 5 megawatts.

685
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,759
And from this, you'll

686
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,639
know the mass
flow rate, right?

687
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:07,279
The M dot, okay?

688
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,519
And then by knowing
the dot, right?

689
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,920
You can take the dot.

690
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,109
Substitute into there.

691
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:19,429
That's Q dot out,

692
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:25,069
and then my q.in, which
I'll write here then.

693
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:28,949
So then my q.in is

694
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:33,590
nothing but my dot
times my Q in, right?

695
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,350
So this dot would
then come here.

696
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,830
You would substitute.

697
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,149
You put your Q in there,

698
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:43,309
and then you would
have the Q in and

699
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:46,309
the Q out. That's good.

700
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:50,869
And the thermal
efficiency is nothing but

701
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:58,390
one minus Q dot
out over q.in,

702
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,989
or in this case, you
could also write that as

703
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:01,709
one minus little Q

704
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:05,749
out over little
Q in, okay?

705
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,709
If you want some numbers,

706
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:08,870
I have some numbers.

707
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,069
At least I have a number

708
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,229
for the efficiency
of this,

709
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:14,149
given the parameters.

710
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:16,349
The efficiency
that I have,

711
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,429
if you substitute
in is that

712
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:29,970
Ea I have an Eta
that's equal to 27.9%.

713
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,689
It's a little bit

714
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:34,329
on a little on
the lower side.

715
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:36,609
And then I find it
always instructive at

716
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,050
these points to compare

717
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,529
with what I would
have as Carne.

718
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:40,529
So if you want to compare

719
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:41,570
this then with Carnot,

720
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,009
Carnot is equal to

721
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,849
one minus the
coldest temperature

722
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,410
divided by the hottest

723
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,729
temperature of the cycle.

724
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:52,480
So you would have
that from um,

725
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,679
the temperature
at state one and

726
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,520
the temperature then
at state three.

727
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,599
And if you put that in,

728
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,999
the absolute
maximum efficiency

729
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:08,640
this cycle could have
would then be 38.4%.

730
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,719
Okay?

731
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:12,520
Questions, Elias.

732
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:23,289
Two to three. On
the far right.

733
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,009
So all I said is that for

734
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:31,169
the so you mean

735
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:34,409
this line here. How
did I write this?

736
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,529
Like just so I understand,

737
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,799
your question is how did
I get to this? Yeah.

738
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,679
I don't have two
to three, right?

739
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,079
I have two, three,

740
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,519
four and five, right?

741
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,639
Yeah. So there's no six.

742
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,759
Yeah. The point is
that you have to draw

743
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,559
a control volume around
the heat exchanger.

744
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,799
And what you do is you
think about how is

745
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,159
energy entering and

746
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:05,160
leaving this
control volume?

747
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,399
What are the inlets to

748
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,839
this control
volume? That's it.

749
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,919
So I'm going to
have an.h4 plus an

750
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,640
m.h2 plus a Q

751
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,799
dot N. That's what's

752
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:18,000
entering. What's leaving?

753
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,200
M.h3+m.h5.

754
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,399
Okay? And that's what
I've written here.

755
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,880
So this is what's entering

756
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,400
and this is
what's leaving.

757
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,879
I divide both
sides by M dot.

758
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:35,559
H two, H four Qn little
QN H three, H five.

759
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:40,520
Reorganize. This is my
QN. That makes sense?

760
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,279
Okay. But that's an
especially critical part

761
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,800
of control
volume analysis.

762
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,880
If you didn't know
how to do that

763
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,320
well in your fundamentals,

764
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,319
you would not do this
problem well, right?

765
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:55,010
Yes, please,
David. The arrows?

766
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,529
Yeah. I will
probably give you

767
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:58,889
words and then tell
you to work it out.

768
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,449
Really an
important part of

769
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:01,969
this class, I don't groan.

770
00:33:01,969 --> 00:33:05,450
You can groan. It's
First Amendment groan.

771
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,289
But the point out of

772
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:07,329
this class is really that

773
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,609
I give you almost
like a prompt,

774
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:12,849
and the reply is this,

775
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:15,209
you should be able
to do that, okay?

776
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:18,210
Yes, please. But if
I draw a diagram,

777
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,689
certainly at least
numerically,

778
00:33:20,689 --> 00:33:22,329
I would give you numbers
and then you can

779
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:24,250
go, in numerical order.

780
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,729
Yes, please.

781
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,189
Let's focus on
the first one.

782
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:43,630
2-3, we treat it as
a heat exchanger.

783
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,869
And when I do
heat additions,

784
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:47,389
there may be a
pressure difference,

785
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:49,270
but that contribution
in terms of

786
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,990
an energy difference
is negligible

787
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,869
compared to how much
heat I'm adding.

788
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,590
We say that 2-3,

789
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,790
it's isobaric
constant pressure.

790
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,509
Good. 4-5, I run

791
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:02,390
pipes into that,
they communicate.

792
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,869
It's diathermal.

793
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:05,069
I can transfer heat in,

794
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:06,390
but they don't communicate

795
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,590
in terms of pressure.

796
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,549
So H four is not the same

797
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,549
as H three or H two, okay?

798
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,990
All I'm saying is that
I'm adding heat 4-5,

799
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,309
and 4-5, it's the
same pressure.

800
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:19,629
So four to five, I

801
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:21,229
have the same
pressure, okay?

802
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:22,990
Again, because it's
a heat exchanger,

803
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,109
and for heat exchangers,

804
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:25,310
from the inlet
to the outlet,

805
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,630
we assume in this class,
no pressure drop.

806
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,029
No pressure drops,
one oh six.

807
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:32,310
Yes, please, Cody.

808
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,150
If we were not given,

809
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:39,069
would we be able to make
the assumption that

810
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:43,620
saturated If I don't

811
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,739
have the pressure
at state three,

812
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,939
I don't believe I can
solve this problem.

813
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,059
I need really a firm state

814
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:51,819
to start with and then use

815
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:54,539
this isentropic
assumptions because

816
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:56,019
basically by having
state three,

817
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:58,299
I know the pressure
at state two.

818
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:00,899
And by assuming the
pump is isentropic,

819
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,219
I know that the
specific entropy

820
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:03,019
here is the same as here.

821
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,059
It's like with the
pressure here and

822
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:08,739
assuming this isentropic,
I know state two.

823
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,619
I was just saying
there's that

824
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:15,739
doesn't solve just want to

825
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,339
know that

826
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:22,370
saturated At the
exit of a condenser,

827
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,530
it's a saturated liquid.

828
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,369
I'm telling you that

829
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:27,009
that's best
practice, right?

830
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,539
No, it will be
compressed, right?

831
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,699
You can't see it
on this diagram,

832
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,179
but you would see it here.

833
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,739
One to two here is

834
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,460
I am increasing
my pressure,

835
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,339
which means that I'm
moving more into this.

836
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:44,659
This is an exaggeration,
though, right?

837
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:46,420
It's an incompressible
substance.

838
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,979
So when I put
that work in,

839
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,819
not much really
changes there.

840
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:53,380
That's why when I plot
it on a real plot,

841
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,419
you can't see the
difference 1-2.

842
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,539
They pretty much are
on top of each other.

843
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:59,339
But it is a
little bit away

844
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,019
from the saturated
liquid line.

845
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:01,499
Okay?

846
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:05,539
Other questions?
Yes, please.

847
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,629
This determines the limit.

848
00:36:14,629 --> 00:36:15,750
The limit is Carne.

849
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,230
You cannot do
better than Carne.

850
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,909
All we're doing with

851
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:21,349
these tricks and stuff

852
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:23,469
is essentially extending,

853
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:27,149
we're extending basically
the temperature

854
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:28,869
where we transfer
heat in, right?

855
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:30,709
So one way to view
this is by doing

856
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:33,949
this process of the
zigzag here, excuse me.

857
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:35,429
I'm transferring
heat in from

858
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,469
a higher temperature
compared to here, right?

859
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:37,989
So basically,

860
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,589
the average
temperature where I'm

861
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:41,070
transferring heat
into this cycle

862
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,469
is higher because
I'm doing this.

863
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:46,499
That's the trick. Or,
like I said before,

864
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:47,580
lowering the temperature

865
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,739
where transfer heat out.

866
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,059
But at the end of
it, everything

867
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:51,580
is limited by Carne.

868
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,859
So you'll never be able to

869
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,660
do better than 38.4%.

870
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,779
Seems like a pretty
bad grade, huh?

871
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:59,019
I don't want to take
that class. Alright, I'm

872
00:36:59,019 --> 00:36:59,860
going to start erasing

873
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,140
and then go on, alright?

874
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,459
I have taken those kinds

875
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:03,459
of classes, but yeah.

876
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:07,909
Alright. Um do do do.

877
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,869
So when you see this,
it looks cumbersome,

878
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:15,830
but step by step,
like a marathon.

879
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,429
If you think about

880
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:17,629
the whole thing,
you'll shut down.

881
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:19,069
But if you see it
and you stick to

882
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,269
fundamentals and
just remember

883
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:21,509
it's one step at a time,

884
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:23,989
everything is
possible, okay?

885
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,990
And just like a marathon,

886
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,550
don't go too fast
at the beginning,

887
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,975
you know, you can
trip. Alright.

888
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,559
Okay.

889
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,680
Okay. Great.

890
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,509
All right. So that
was reheat, okay?

891
00:38:02,509 --> 00:38:03,429
And again, the whole point

892
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:04,549
was extending that region

893
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:05,629
where we transfer the heat

894
00:38:05,629 --> 00:38:07,270
in from a higher
temperature.

895
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,629
We can also do
regeneration, all right?

896
00:38:11,629 --> 00:38:13,229
And remember, in
regeneration,

897
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:13,829
the whole point of

898
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:15,709
regeneration is I
want to increase

899
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:17,430
the temperature
of my fluid

900
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,469
before dumping heat
into it, right?

901
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:20,909
I want the temperature at

902
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:23,349
the inlet to my boiler
to be higher, right?

903
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:24,989
In Brighton, that's
what we did, right?

904
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:26,670
We tried to increase
the temperature

905
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,270
of the fluid
prior to entering

906
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,070
the combustor by warming

907
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,909
it up with exhaust
gases, all right?

908
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,754
That's what we did.

909
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:37,519
So this is what
it looks like,

910
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,199
one way it can
look like for

911
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,119
a ranking cycle, right?

912
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,679
So let's start from

913
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,639
let's start from the
second pump, okay?

914
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,000
So the second pump,

915
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,519
that's not too dissimilar,

916
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,279
except that it's state
four now, but fine.

917
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:53,600
So I leave the pump,
I go into my boiler,

918
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,599
I pass through my
turbine, all right?

919
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,519
And what you have here at

920
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,960
the turbine is you have
two exits, two exits.

921
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,384
One that goes to
the condenser.

922
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,409
Passes through
the pump and

923
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:09,649
goes into the box
and then continues.

924
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:12,209
And then another
one at state six,

925
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:15,370
which does not pass
through the condenser,

926
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,929
which means that
it stays warm?

927
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:20,929
So you bleed off some
of the steam from

928
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,249
the turbine and you mix it

929
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:27,969
with you mix it
with some of the,

930
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:30,170
the compressed
water that's

931
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,490
coming out of
the first pump.

932
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,290
This is an open
feed water heater,

933
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,329
okay? And they mix.

934
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:37,769
We haven't done this,

935
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,409
I think, really
much in this class,

936
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:40,529
but this is a case where

937
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:41,689
I have two streams in,

938
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:44,189
they mix and there's
one leaving, all right?

939
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:47,729
Okay. But this one
shouldn't shock you.

940
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:49,729
There's no work here in

941
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:52,329
or out, and
it's adiabatic.

942
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,489
What it means is that
I have an M dot,

943
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:57,530
some M dot coming into
here with an enthalpy.

944
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,729
I have some M dot coming

945
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,049
in here with an enthalpy.

946
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:02,089
The sum of those
two M dots is

947
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:05,209
my original M dot times
another enthropy?

948
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:08,879
Um, So that's the one
thing that's new.

949
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,959
The second thing
that's new is

950
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,840
the way that we
describe the fraction.

951
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,079
Let's say the
turbine steady flow,

952
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,280
I have some dot going
through my pump,

953
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,800
through my boiler, and
entering my turbine.

954
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,719
The way that these
problems are stated is

955
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,599
that there's a fraction
Y, let's say 0-1,

956
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,959
a fraction that is Y

957
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,199
of that dot
that goes here,

958
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,600
and there's a
fraction dot times

959
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,719
one minus Y that goes
into here, okay?

960
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:42,100
So mixing and then
fractions of mass. David.

961
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,780
Why do we need
a water heater?

962
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,219
I'm going to show you.

963
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:51,379
Okay. I'll show you. Okay.

964
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,219
Yeah, and

965
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,459
so this is what the
cycle looks like.

966
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:56,579
If you were to shot
on a TS diagram,

967
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,059
you have one to two to

968
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:01,739
well, let's focus
on this, right?

969
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:03,539
So if I had just the
normal three, four,

970
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:08,099
five, you know, let's
say, three, four, 571.

971
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,859
So that's the, you know,

972
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:12,499
cycle that essentially
looks like that.

973
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:13,419
The new thing is then the

974
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:14,499
three to six that you,

975
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:17,369
um, that you have, okay?

976
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:19,729
But remember, the
whole point of this,

977
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:22,169
David, is that I,
through this process,

978
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:24,889
want to increase
the temperature

979
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:26,689
at state four before

980
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:28,209
I start dumping
heat into it.

981
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,769
So the whole point
is that, like,

982
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:31,890
when I do my heat
addition from my boiler,

983
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,169
I don't want to
dump it in at

984
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:35,089
a temperature at state
two, which is low.

985
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:36,289
I'd love to dump it into

986
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:37,769
something that's
at state four,

987
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,449
which is warmer, okay?

988
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:41,369
So that's why we do
it. Yes, please.

989
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:44,809
Will you be able to change

990
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:48,090
the condenser to adjust
the temperature?

991
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,169
I'm not sure I
understand the question.

992
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:51,199
Say it again.

993
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:59,829
Um Okay. All right.

994
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:01,750
So I will speed

995
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,390
through this one,
but in short,

996
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,669
right, we can go

997
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:12,629
step by step here
through the problem.

998
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:14,070
Maybe I'll just jump

999
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,829
to this in the
interest of time.

1000
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:17,469
So what you
have All right,

1001
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,829
so let's go to
what's given.

1002
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:22,669
What's given is
that the quality at

1003
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:24,949
the exit of

1004
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:27,749
the open feed water
heater is zero.

1005
00:42:27,749 --> 00:42:31,144
So it's a saturated
liquid there.

1006
00:42:31,144 --> 00:42:33,619
To Cody's point.
So why is that?

1007
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:34,739
Because at state two, I

1008
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:36,179
am not saturated
anymore, right?

1009
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,819
I have compressed
that liquid there.

1010
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,179
And so when I mix it then

1011
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:41,100
with this warmer steam,

1012
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,659
what's going to
exit is then

1013
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:44,339
a saturated liquid, okay?

1014
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,619
So that's one thing.

1015
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:48,060
So the saturated liquid,

1016
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,659
we know State five,

1017
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:51,179
so at the exit of
the boiler, right,

1018
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:53,299
we have complete
information there.

1019
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:58,499
Good. We're told
the pressure at

1020
00:42:58,499 --> 00:43:01,300
the exit of the turbine

1021
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,700
prior to entering
the condenser.

1022
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,819
So we're given that.

1023
00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:06,039
And we're also
given the pressure.

1024
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:08,139
Of the let's say
the bleed line.

1025
00:43:08,139 --> 00:43:09,099
So basically the steam

1026
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:10,019
that we're bleeding off,

1027
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,859
we're also given
that pressure.

1028
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:13,699
And we know because
this is a condenser,

1029
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:17,660
at state one, we are
a saturated liquid.

1030
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,099
And this is
allowed, right,

1031
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,939
X three and X one
are allowed to be

1032
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:22,179
zero because of the fact

1033
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:23,499
that I transfer work here,

1034
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:25,099
and I'm compressing
the liquid, okay?

1035
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:27,900
So at state two, I am
not a saturated liquid.

1036
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,819
And what you want to
determine here is

1037
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:31,420
the fraction of the steam

1038
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,019
that you have to take off,

1039
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:34,739
that you have
to bleed out of

1040
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:36,499
the turbine Y, okay?

1041
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:37,780
And then what
is the thermal

1042
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,550
efficiency of this cycle?

1043
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,719
What assumptions
do you make, okay?

1044
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,279
So we can start with

1045
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:46,879
doing the analysis of
the turbine, okay?

1046
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:48,759
So it's an ideal
regenerative.

1047
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,000
This means that
the turbine

1048
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,639
is adiabatic
and reversible.

1049
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:54,399
It means that the
entropy at the exit of

1050
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,320
the turbine is the
same as the inlet.

1051
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,359
So S six is S five,

1052
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,039
and S seven is
also S five, okay?

1053
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,319
But they're two
different states

1054
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:04,520
because they have two
different pressures.

1055
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,799
But you know state six and

1056
00:44:05,799 --> 00:44:07,579
you know state
seven, okay?

1057
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,199
Because you know
state seven, you

1058
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,919
know the pressure at
state seven, right?

1059
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:12,400
Condenser is a
heat exchanger,

1060
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,359
so P one is equal
to p7x1 was given.

1061
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,959
Now I know state
one, all right?

1062
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:21,239
Okay. This open feed
water heater, right?

1063
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,199
It's a mixing
chamber, right?

1064
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,000
Just like a
heat exchanger,

1065
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,880
there are not going
to be pressure drops

1066
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,399
across these
devices, right?

1067
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,159
So because I know

1068
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:33,319
the pressure because I

1069
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:35,039
know state six and
another pressure,

1070
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,399
I'm going to know
the pressure at

1071
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:38,240
state three at the exit,

1072
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,719
and I'm also going
to know the pressure

1073
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,920
at the inlet,
the other inlet.

1074
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,839
So P two is also
P six, right?

1075
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,760
Because the pump
is isentropic,

1076
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,839
S two is S one, now
I know state two.

1077
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,339
Because we were
given X three,

1078
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:51,659
and now we know
P three from

1079
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:53,339
this, you know
state three.

1080
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:55,179
If you go on
to state four,

1081
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:57,259
the pump operates
isentropically S

1082
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:58,059
four is S three.

1083
00:44:58,059 --> 00:44:59,980
Because the boiler
is a heat exchanger,

1084
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,659
P four is equal to P five.

1085
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:03,259
So now I got state four.

1086
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:05,260
State five was given.

1087
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,460
I know all of my states.

1088
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,579
I have all of my
states here now.

1089
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,339
What I will write out,

1090
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:14,819
and I'll spend time in is

1091
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,860
the analysis of the
open feed water heater.

1092
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,580
So the open feed
water heater

1093
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,429
looks like this.
All right.

1094
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,429
And this is important
to be able to define.

1095
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:24,030
So I have one inlet,

1096
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:27,990
I have another inlet,
and I have one outlet.

1097
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,510
This is adiabatic,

1098
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,030
and there's no
work transfer,

1099
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,709
all right? So let's
look at this.

1100
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:35,749
I have here, state six,

1101
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:37,109
which is entering, right?

1102
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,549
I have a let's do our
mass balance first.

1103
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:41,429
So the mass balance
here is I have

1104
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:44,150
an M dot times

1105
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,270
Y. I have an M dot times

1106
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,469
one minus Y entering,

1107
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:51,389
and then here I
have an M dot.

1108
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:53,750
Conservation of mass.

1109
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,349
The same thing now

1110
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:56,950
for conservation
of energy,

1111
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,839
okay? Right?

1112
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:05,080
So neglecting
kinetic energy

1113
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,480
and potential
energy changes

1114
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,519
in this process, right?

1115
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:13,119
I have an M dot
times Y times H six,

1116
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,120
which carries me in an
M dot times one minus

1117
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,399
Y times H two, which
is carrying me in.

1118
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:23,560
And then I have
an M dot times

1119
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,479
H three, which is out.

1120
00:46:25,479 --> 00:46:27,439
So this plus this

1121
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:29,919
must equal to
this. All right?

1122
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:37,050
O. So dot times

1123
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:43,530
Y six plus dot
times one minus

1124
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,369
Y times H two

1125
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:50,929
must be equal to m
dot times H three.

1126
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:54,919
Our dots are going
to drop, okay?

1127
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:59,759
And so what we
will have is

1128
00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:03,519
Y age six plus H

1129
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,439
two minus Y H
two is a three.

1130
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:10,319
We reorganize for Y,

1131
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,079
Y times age six
minus H two

1132
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:19,119
is equal to age
three minus H two,

1133
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,279
Y is equal to H

1134
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:23,399
three minus H two

1135
00:47:23,399 --> 00:47:26,719
divided by age
six minus H two.

1136
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,600
Because I know
all my states,

1137
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,934
I can solve for
this Y here, okay?

1138
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:34,309
Good. Let me go back.

1139
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,830
The thermal efficiency
of this cycle

1140
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,509
is going to be the same as

1141
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:41,709
every other one that
we've done, right?

1142
00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:43,749
The heat in, right,

1143
00:47:43,749 --> 00:47:47,949
one minus Q out divided
by Q in, right?

1144
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,549
You would know
the Q out, right?

1145
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:54,190
Essentially,
you'd have dot,

1146
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:01,349
one minus Y times H
seven minus H one, okay?

1147
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:02,749
And your heat
in is going to

1148
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,549
be dot, just dot,

1149
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:05,910
and that's going
to be times

1150
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:09,189
H five minus H four, okay?

1151
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,859
Are there questions
about this?

1152
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,099
I hope the only
radical thing I

1153
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:18,899
said here was about

1154
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,779
the mixing chamber,
but with this,

1155
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:23,099
you're able to
define the why,

1156
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:23,899
and then that's

1157
00:48:23,899 --> 00:48:24,739
the one thing that
was different

1158
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:27,259
compared to the
other problems.

1159
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:29,619
All right. That's
what it looks like

1160
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:32,099
on a TS diagram.

1161
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:32,979
That's what it
would look like

1162
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:34,499
on a PV diagram.

1163
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:36,220
With this, you should
be able to analyze

1164
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,020
these regenerative and
reheat power cycles.

1165
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,539
We'll continue with
our last one there.

1166
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:40,700
After the next lecture,

1167
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,019
that closes Module two,

1168
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,499
and that's all
the material that

1169
00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:45,099
you're responsible
for on Qiz two.

1170
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:46,259
If you have questions,
I'm up here.

1171
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:48,739
Otherwise, have a
wonderful weekend.
