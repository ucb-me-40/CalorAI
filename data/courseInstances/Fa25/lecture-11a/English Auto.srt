1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,240
All right. I got 210.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,680
I'm going to get started.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,400
Today we're moving out of

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,680
power cycles and
into refrigeration.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,360
Before I get started, that

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,680
means that we've
closed Module two.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,360
So it means you have

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,120
an assessment
coming Quiz two.

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,159
Please see the
quiz two page,

10
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:18,920
your reflexes to email

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,559
and contact me.
I love that.

12
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,879
However, to make you more

13
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,479
informed on your
question to me and

14
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:24,999
the GSIs and the readers

15
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,904
who worked very hard,
read this page.

16
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:30,129
I promise you, 90% of
your answers are there.

17
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,289
Reservations,

18
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,369
self reservation
start tomorrow.

19
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:35,209
I have extra office hours

20
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,689
next week at lunchtime
in the I room.

21
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,169
And I recommend you

22
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:40,289
look at Module two review.

23
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,970
So there's
previous midterms

24
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,209
that we've done in
this class that

25
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,369
are there. We'll
keep adding them.

26
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:47,689
And just to remind you,

27
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,129
you're expected
to be able to use

28
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,170
the Jupyter Ab
Workspace Module PiCor.

29
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,809
So really look at
Homework nine,

30
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,049
see some stuff in there

31
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:56,290
because that's
an expectation.

32
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,529
It's an expectation
of this

33
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,169
class that you're
able to go in

34
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,769
and basically
define a function

35
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:02,889
that is a turbine, right?

36
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:03,970
Cossors giving

37
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,729
inputs and outputs
and stuff like that.

38
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,209
Okay, in terms of
your problems,

39
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:09,210
you're responsible for
entry regeneration,

40
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,969
your two power cycles,
and then fundamentals.

41
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,289
So the way you
should see this is

42
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,129
relatively easy,
you know, good,

43
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,529
and that two pointer is

44
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:19,129
probably the hardest
problem, okay?

45
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,449
So great.

46
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,409
So actually today, you're

47
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:24,610
going to be able
to introduce

48
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,969
concepts of
refrigerators and

49
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,409
heat pumps and measure
their performance and

50
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,809
analyze the ideal vapor

51
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:33,485
compression refrigeration
cycle, Maya.

52
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:37,200
Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Thursday Friday.

53
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,239
So it's the dates on
the courses dates.

54
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,039
It says the two dates.
Other questions?

55
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,440
Okay, heat pumps.

56
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,439
So the plot that
I'm showing you

57
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,839
here is from a
couple of years ago

58
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:53,839
showing you the number
of units sold as

59
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:54,959
a function of time for

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,720
heat pumps and
gas furnaces.

61
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,999
And three years
ago, there were

62
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,639
more heat pumps sold in

63
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,559
the United States than

64
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,719
there were furnaces, okay?

65
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,079
And today's lecture is

66
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,439
going to sort of
reinforce why.

67
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,880
Um So why is it important?

68
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,119
Well, one, I mean,
in electrification,

69
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,239
if you have renewable
sources that power it,

70
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,559
essentially,
you're not using

71
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,760
natural gas then
to heat, okay?

72
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,519
So it's a decarbonization.

73
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,320
The second thing is

74
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,760
that it just makes
economic sense.

75
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
What I'm going to show

76
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,599
you today is that
the heat that

77
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,480
I transfer into a
building to heat it,

78
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,079
I have one unit
of electricity

79
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,040
to move three units
of heat, okay?

80
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,279
That's what we're
going to see.

81
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,600
So there you would
say, okay, well,

82
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,439
what if I just ran
and transferred

83
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,640
work into a resistor

84
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,760
and got heat out of that?

85
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,280
That's one for one, okay?

86
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,280
That's not good.

87
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,040
Right? But it's still
done, you know,

88
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
and with heat pumps,

89
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,640
especially when they
get cold outside,

90
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,919
sometimes that's all
you can do to do it.

91
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,159
But anyways,
that's a three to

92
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,719
one that's organ
analyzed today.

93
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,680
How's that
possible without

94
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,840
violating the first law?

95
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,280
Okay, so what does
it look like?

96
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,119
It's a relatively
simple system.

97
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:59,430
Um What's the general term

98
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,270
for this is called
vapor compression,

99
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,749
a vapor compression cycle.

100
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,430
So what does that
mean? I have

101
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,110
a compressor that is here.

102
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,310
What is it compressing?

103
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,669
It's compressing a vapor.

104
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,589
I have a vapor that's
coming in here.

105
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:14,150
I'm compressing that.

106
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,190
That's being sent then to

107
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,789
a coil where it condenses
and releases heat.

108
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:21,429
So heat is
transferred out here.

109
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:22,950
You get a condensed state,

110
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,670
that goes through a
throttling valve,

111
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,349
an synthalic process,
so a big pressure drop,

112
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,750
and essentially
you get then

113
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,629
that fluid ready to boil.

114
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,030
Where then it
absorbs heat.

115
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,149
So this operation here
is as a heat pump.

116
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,549
So what are you
pumping, alright?

117
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:38,389
Essentially,

118
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,150
you have this system,
which is outside,

119
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,510
and you're taking
in heat from

120
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,150
the outside where
it's cold, okay?

121
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,470
So you're taking
in heat from

122
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,230
the outside where
it's cold in,

123
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,830
and you're pumping it into

124
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,230
an indoor space where

125
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,509
you're transferring
that heat

126
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:52,110
at a higher
temperature, okay?

127
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,429
So it's kind of weird.

128
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:54,550
I'm taking heat from a

129
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,710
place that's cold, okay?

130
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,910
Pumping it in and actually

131
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,510
warming, but it
works, a right?

132
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,420
Um, The more
commonly seen one,

133
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,019
and this is one
that's been

134
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,820
implemented in
this country for

135
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,819
basically like 100 years
in homes and stuff,

136
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,260
is what you would call a

137
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,379
refrigeration
system or HVAC,

138
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,020
so heating ventilation
and air conditioning.

139
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,780
So the air
conditioning part

140
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,420
of this is shown here.

141
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,084
So how does
that look like?

142
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,710
Exactly, you know,
just swapped.

143
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,989
So essentially, this is

144
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:25,189
your indoor coil, right?

145
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,989
So this is your house.

146
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,590
Let's say that
you want to cool.

147
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,029
And then this is
the outside where

148
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:30,110
you want to pump the heat.

149
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,509
So same thing, same drill.

150
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:32,550
I have a vapor that comes

151
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,669
in on my compressor.

152
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,949
I pressurize
that, it warms.

153
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,270
I condense it on

154
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,710
this coil and you
blow the fans.

155
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,990
If you look
like a rooftop,

156
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,990
if you see what's
called central air,

157
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,309
you'll see these
units on the side

158
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:44,670
of the house that blow air

159
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,069
over basically big
radiators that are there.

160
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,830
So you're
transferring the heat

161
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,909
from that warmer fluid

162
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,270
to the warm outside air

163
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,830
goes through a
throtting valve,

164
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,424
big pressure
drop in cooling.

165
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:57,379
You boil that.

166
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,180
This is what you would

167
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,499
then have inside
of the home.

168
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,779
So at this point,
you'd have here

169
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,260
this evaporator,
which is there,

170
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,379
which is absorbing
heat from

171
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,380
the house, let's
say, evaporating.

172
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,900
So the exit here, you're

173
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,819
a saturated vapor that

174
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,139
goes back into
the compressor

175
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,180
and so on and so forth.

176
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,739
Okay. But the point

177
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,019
is that with
this technology,

178
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,819
so the air
conditioning side

179
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,380
is very well established.

180
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,419
Carrier hear the
name carrier, right?

181
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,139
He was a pioneer in
developing this.

182
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,449
I uh, you know, in this,

183
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:30,970
if you want to ask
yourself why it's

184
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,689
called air conditioning
and that cooling,

185
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:33,889
it's an interesting
question, okay?

186
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,370
So conditioning comes from

187
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,729
how people used
to treat yarn,

188
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,009
okay? It used to
be conditioned.

189
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,329
You leave it
in a room, and

190
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:42,049
that conditioning had
to do with humidity.

191
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,290
So a big part
of this, which

192
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,450
we're not going
touch on yet,

193
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,369
but I'm alluding to

194
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,369
in the future is
the conditioning,

195
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:47,769
which is actually
basically the regulation

196
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:48,930
of the humidity
in the air.

197
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,089
Okay.

198
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,009
Today, I'm going to

199
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:51,050
just talk about how
you move the heat.

200
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,169
Later on, we'll
get into how

201
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,530
you actually control
the humidity.

202
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,209
And that gets into

203
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,649
comfort and what
comfort is,

204
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,130
and it's a long
history and it's

205
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,629
an ongoing debate as to

206
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,289
I would say,
what's optimal?

207
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,450
What is comfort? Okay?
Yeah. So anyway,

208
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,690
so this is, again, a
more familiar system.

209
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,009
And then, well,
not in this city,

210
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,209
the weather is,
like, perfect.

211
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:09,649
But if you go

212
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:10,529
everywhere else,
then, you know,

213
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:11,330
you need either it's too

214
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,490
hot or it's too cold.

215
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,810
And you can
switch this and

216
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,529
then turn it into
a heat pump.

217
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,969
Okay. So the second case

218
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,449
where definitely you
still have it here,

219
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,929
and it would be common is

220
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:23,330
that same system
as I've shown

221
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,250
you for the cooling mode.

222
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,089
So essentially
air conditioning,

223
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,689
in a sense, applied
to a refrigerator.

224
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,730
So refrigerators operate
the same principle.

225
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,090
It's still vapor
compression.

226
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,930
The noise that
you hear them

227
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,610
with the fridge is
the compressor,

228
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,009
and it's the same
drill, okay?

229
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:40,610
Where you're
transferring heat

230
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,050
out of is the
enclosed space.

231
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,010
So that's the heat you're

232
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,249
absorbing into the cycle,

233
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:44,809
and then where you

234
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:46,289
reject it is basically
in the back of it.

235
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:47,649
So if you look in the
back, you'll see,

236
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,410
like, long coils and
radiators there,

237
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,170
and you have the
cooling the warmer heat

238
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,929
or the heat being
rejected to,

239
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:56,429
um, with the
temperature with

240
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:57,910
the fluid as a
higher temperature

241
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,229
than into the
ambient, okay?

242
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,909
Yeah, so that's it.

243
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:04,350
So I'm going to
go through I'll

244
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,470
derive now sort of,

245
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,349
you know, how we talk
about the performance.

246
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:09,069
So the way that we rate
the performance of

247
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,310
these systems is by

248
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,350
a coefficient of
performance, right?

249
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,989
The main thing, right?

250
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:14,789
Why we call it

251
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:16,389
coefficient of
performance and not like

252
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,189
a theral efficiency
of ether is that

253
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,220
a CO soon ea, right?

254
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,140
What's allowable
there, like zero,

255
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,460
less than equal to one
for a thermal engine.

256
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,179
And for a COP, okay,

257
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,619
this is always
greater than

258
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:32,499
or equal to one, okay?

259
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:35,579
So it's not an
efficiency in the sense.

260
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:37,740
It's still a ratio of
a desirable quantity

261
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,699
divided by what we
have to pay for,

262
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,459
but its number is

263
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,139
bigger than
bigger than one.

264
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,779
Excuse me while I
get a new marker.

265
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:57,009
Okay. Is this
better? Much better.

266
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,849
Okay. All right.

267
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:02,809
So just to then

268
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,209
to start and take us

269
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,329
through the analysis
of the cycle.

270
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,409
So we'll draw it again.

271
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:14,090
So here we had
a compressor

272
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,009
where we were putting

273
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,649
some work right into this.

274
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,769
This was going up and then

275
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:24,529
passing through
a condenser.

276
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,449
So I had some Q dot
out, which was here.

277
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,289
This is then going through

278
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,970
a throttling valve, right?

279
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,090
So here, this then goes

280
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,570
into your
evaporator, okay?

281
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,129
And then back into
the compressor.

282
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,290
In terms of the state,

283
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,609
so the way that
I've labeled

284
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,329
the states is
that at the exit

285
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,130
of the compressor
is State two,

286
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,210
the entrance is state one,

287
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,170
exit of the condenser
is State three,

288
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,290
and the exit of our

289
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,570
throttling valve
or expansion valve

290
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,180
is state four, right?

291
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,820
Just like all the other

292
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,860
steady flow analysis
that we did, right?

293
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,699
We're neglecting, it's
a steady flow device,

294
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,379
so the change in mass

295
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,939
of our individual
control volume.

296
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:14,540
So if I j control volume

297
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,659
around my compressor.

298
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:20,019
I do it around my
heat exchangers.

299
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,740
I do it around my
expansion valve,

300
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,819
and again, my
heat exchangers,

301
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:28,060
as I showed
this here, this

302
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,460
should be a Q dot.

303
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,919
All? This should be aq.in.

304
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,420
All right, so the change
in mass of each of

305
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,820
those control volumes
is equal to zero.

306
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,779
The change in energy

307
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,899
in those control
volumes is zero,

308
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:43,100
and the change
in entropy in

309
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,140
those control volumes
is also zero, right?

310
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,779
The steady flow
assumption.

311
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,420
Right? And what
we'd like to do

312
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,700
right in this
analysis is we'd to

313
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,499
determine the COP

314
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:08,699
for a refrigeration.

315
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,669
Cycle and a heat pump.

316
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:17,590
Just make sure
that's still

317
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,950
visible a little bit off.

318
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:27,190
Okay. All right.
All right.

319
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:33,390
And then we want to
determine and then

320
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,509
determine the COPs

321
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:45,690
assuming reversible.
All right.

322
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,170
So we assume that
both those cycles

323
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,650
then operate in a
reversible manner.

324
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,969
So this will be
the strategy

325
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:54,610
for analyzing a more
realistic system,

326
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,330
and then this will
essentially be how we

327
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,489
determine the
maximum efficiency,

328
00:10:58,489 --> 00:10:59,329
which is the Carnal.

329
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,210
So we'll do a
carnal efficiency,

330
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,409
but now for a
refrigeration

331
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:03,370
and a heat pump and

332
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,370
not a heat engine, right?

333
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,130
And resume
reversible operating

334
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:21,929
between two thermal
reservoirs.

335
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,010
Okay. All right, to do.

336
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,450
Yeah, and so we can
talk for a second about

337
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,250
the properties before we

338
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,370
get into more of the
energy analysis.

339
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,129
So one of the most
popular refrigerants

340
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:44,170
that's out there
is R 134 A, okay?

341
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,489
So when you're determining

342
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:46,529
properties in this system,

343
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,290
you're not working
with water, okay?

344
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,089
And the reason why
you're not working with

345
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,610
water is because
water does not boil.

346
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,330
Well, it can, but it's

347
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,050
not great for boiling
at room temperature,

348
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,610
or lower or higher,

349
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,690
where you would need it.

350
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,570
You need other fluids.

351
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,929
You need other
fluids that are more

352
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,930
volatile at these
conditions,

353
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,250
and this is one of them.

354
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,930
These are fluorocarbons.

355
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,090
Another very widely
used refrigerant

356
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,809
is CO two and ammonia.

357
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,770
If you eat French fries,

358
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,690
which I love, and
my kids love,

359
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,170
ammonia is probably maybe

360
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,050
the largest
refrigeration systems

361
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,609
on this planet
run on ammonia.

362
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:28,410
The reason why
we don't use

363
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,290
them in whole foods and

364
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,015
stuff is because it's

365
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:34,020
Kind of dangerous, okay?

366
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,660
It needs copper.
It's not super good.

367
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,819
So in those cases,
you might pair up

368
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:40,940
ammonia with CO two.

369
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,140
So you might
call this like

370
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,100
a top cycle and
a bottom cycle,

371
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,939
like we did before
for the Rankin.

372
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,740
We'll get to how we
can pair up things.

373
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,780
But these are pretty
important ones.

374
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,500
If you have, like,
a small fridge,

375
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,899
like a beverage fridge,

376
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,180
they don't run
on any of these.

377
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,020
They actually run
sometimes on butane,

378
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,380
like lighter fluid, okay,

379
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,820
those things are
also volatile,

380
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,940
but they don't
use those in

381
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,100
very large
quantities. Why?

382
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,720
Yeah, exactly. So
what Kai said, right?

383
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,519
If a beverage fridge

384
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,920
is kind of explosive,
I don't know.

385
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,759
So anyways, but
these are the ones,

386
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,800
but you'll primarily
be in this class using

387
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,679
PCalor to determine
the properties of

388
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,439
RO 134 A, carbon dioxide.

389
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,120
And then I don't

390
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,960
actually we'll have
to see with ammonia.

391
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,279
I don't recall for
doing it, but I think

392
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,760
R 134 A and C
two are two of

393
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,040
the most common ones that

394
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,720
we work with. You
don't really care.

395
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,800
You just declare
substance equals this,

396
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,680
and then it does the
lifting for you.

397
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,480
Okay. But anyways,
you'll use

398
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,620
PClor to determine
these properties.

399
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,299
Do do do, where are we at?

400
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,500
All right. So
if we get into

401
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,020
the specific devices now.

402
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,500
So if we get into
our energy and

403
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,579
entropy analysis
of these devices,

404
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:00,099
like one to two
is a compressor,

405
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:02,739
and a compressor
works with vapor?

406
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,060
A pompas for a liquid,

407
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,660
a compressor is for vapor?

408
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,219
And we don't work
with multiphase.

409
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:08,340
You're basically
compressing a

410
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,379
vapor with this.

411
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,019
This is adiabatic,
it's an adiabatic.

412
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,500
And we have, it's a
reversible, right?

413
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,580
We can say for now, um,
We can say, you know,

414
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,540
in the first step of
the analysis to get

415
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,740
to state, you know,

416
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,780
two S, right there,

417
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,900
we can say that
little S one

418
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,300
is equal to little S two.

419
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,739
What's the logic
behind that?

420
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,060
We have an adiabatic
process that

421
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,180
operates reversibly
emits steady flow.

422
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,420
So we have no gen,

423
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,659
that means.in is dot out,

424
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:46,580
in as one equals
dot out as two,

425
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,180
m.in ism dot out.

426
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,140
So you'll end up with,

427
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,660
you'll end up
with that, right?

428
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,100
Um, Good.

429
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,900
So that's for
our compressor,

430
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,020
for two to three on
the condenser, right?

431
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,640
Condenser. Condenser here.

432
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,440
It's isobaric, right?

433
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,039
So our Delta P across
any heat exchanger,

434
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,840
we're going to assume is

435
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,760
zero unless
otherwise told.

436
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,800
We have no shaft
work, right.

437
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,319
Our W dot is
equal to zero,

438
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,959
and the exit states here.

439
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,000
So the exit state like

440
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,840
our buddy we talked
with Ben before,

441
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,000
the exit state of this is

442
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,319
going to be a
saturated liquid.

443
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:33,839
So X three is going
to be equal to zero.

444
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,039
All right. Three to four

445
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,280
is your expansion valve.

446
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,919
So three to four
is expansion.

447
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:47,810
Valve. And this is
adiabatic, right?

448
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,529
So we have adiabatic,

449
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:53,530
and there is
no work, okay?

450
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,610
And then for
our evaporator,

451
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,529
so then excuse me,

452
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:02,529
four to one here,
evaporator.

453
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,690
Evaporate evaporator.

454
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,650
Again, it's a
heat exchanger,

455
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,970
so your Delta P
is equal to zero,

456
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,770
and you also have no work.

457
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,490
Obviously, the point
of it is you want

458
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,130
to absorb heat, okay.

459
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,370
For all of these things,

460
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,610
we also neglect, right?

461
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,890
We're neglecting globally
for all of this.

462
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,010
Changes in kinetic energy

463
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,689
are zero and changes

464
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:33,610
in potential energy
are also zero, right?

465
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,220
Okay. For your
compressor then,

466
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,820
that means that
your w.in is an

467
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,420
m.h2a minus H one,
the actual one.

468
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,660
Again, I'll write
down how we use

469
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,380
isotropic efficiencies
if needed.

470
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,980
For our condenser,
our Q dot,

471
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,579
out of the condenser is

472
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:06,019
your M dot times H
three minus H two.

473
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,029
I'm sorry, the other way.

474
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,229
So the condenser
heat is going out,

475
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:13,749
a state two A has the
higher enthalpy H

476
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:16,829
two A minus H three,

477
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,629
your expansion
valve, so we

478
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:20,950
neglect changes in
potential kinetic energy.

479
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,110
You have no heat transfer

480
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,310
and you have no
work transfer.

481
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,669
So what does this mean
for this process?

482
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,709
What about the inlet

483
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,749
is equal to what
about the outlet?

484
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,310
Say it again, Cody.

485
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,630
Exactly.

486
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,110
It's a nice enthalpic
process. Thank you.

487
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,629
H three is equal
to H four there.

488
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:47,369
I And then our last one

489
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:49,170
is then with
the evaporator.

490
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,929
So our evaporator then,

491
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:55,289
our Q dot N is
equal to M dot,

492
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,009
right, because
it's evaporating,

493
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,170
it's absorbing heat.

494
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,410
So what you'd
expect then is

495
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,009
that the enthalpy
at state one

496
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,810
is then greater
than the enthalpy

497
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,729
at state four,

498
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:07,889
m.h1 minus H four.

499
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,819
If we If we

500
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:14,220
come back to this H
twoA, for a compressor,

501
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,099
the isentropic
efficiency of

502
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,700
a compressor is defined

503
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,219
as the minimum work in

504
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,500
needed to compress divided

505
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,419
by the actual work.

506
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:31,479
So the minimum would
be H twos minus H one.

507
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:35,359
The actual one would be
H two A minus H one.

508
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,119
In general, if you

509
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,599
were given that
problem here,

510
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,399
this is a piece of

511
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,720
information that
would be given.

512
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,239
You determine H twos,

513
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,320
by one piece of

514
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,680
information to get
to it is that you

515
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,200
assume that the
specific entropy

516
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,719
at state two is equal to

517
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,999
the specific entropy
at state one,

518
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:58,400
and then you basically
solve for HA.

519
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,270
The light condition
would be given.

520
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:07,579
Mm hmm. Okay. All right.

521
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,219
Now we've got this.

522
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,899
This is my these

523
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:16,059
are my properties
here, my efficiencies.

524
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,460
So if we come
now to the COP,

525
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,059
so for the COP,
this is, right,

526
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:24,939
the ratio of, you know,

527
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:27,059
what I want to what
I have to pay.

528
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,500
So for a
refrigeration cycle,

529
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,159
what I want is Right?

530
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,959
So if it's cooling
something, right,

531
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,359
the desired
output is that I

532
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,279
want to maximize QL,

533
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,799
what I'm going to pay is

534
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,079
the network in, okay?

535
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,199
So this would be,
right, your Q dot.

536
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,999
And in this case,
this Q dot is what

537
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,280
is absorbed by
the evaporator.

538
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,759
So this would be in
our case here, q.in,

539
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,520
right, is the
heat absorbed

540
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,920
by the evaporator.

541
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,319
And then the network in
is just w.in, right?

542
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,639
The reason why
we don't have it

543
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:12,979
being a networking is

544
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,099
because we are
working with

545
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:15,539
an expansion valve, right?

546
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,179
We're working with
an expansion valve

547
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,979
here because
it's convenient.

548
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,939
If I didn't use an
expansion valve here,

549
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:24,500
what other device could I

550
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,460
use to expand my fluid?

551
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,179
So I have a compressor

552
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,819
that is compressing what

553
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:39,634
is kind of like the
inverse of a compressor.

554
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:41,609
A turbine. That's
exactly right.

555
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:42,809
So you could go
in and you could

556
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,250
replace this
with the turbine

557
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,209
if you wanted to.

558
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,649
And then instead of
this being w.in,

559
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,929
this would be
aw.net in, okay?

560
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,889
And the reason why we use

561
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:54,370
an expansion valve
is because it's

562
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,609
cheap and turbines
cost money, okay?

563
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:58,609
And we want a
cheap, you know,

564
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:00,809
fridge or whatever, okay?

565
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,969
But if you wanted to,

566
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:04,169
you could go in
and look and maybe

567
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:05,569
see if there's
opportunities for

568
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:08,089
maybe if you wanted

569
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,649
to boost the
COP even more,

570
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:11,889
it might make
sense then to do

571
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:14,570
that expansion process
with the turbine.

572
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,489
Okay, so what does

573
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:17,929
this look like from
what we've defined?

574
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:25,049
So our q.in is at our
evaporator, right?

575
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:31,289
So that's our M dot times
H one minus H four.

576
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:34,209
And then our w.in
here is from

577
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,930
our compressor
that's M dot HA

578
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:44,969
minus H one and
let's go away.

579
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,489
And so that's the COP then

580
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:50,700
for a refrigeration cycle.

581
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,619
You can do the same
thing for the heat pump.

582
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,739
So the COP for
the heat pump,

583
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:55,939
all that's
different is that

584
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,660
the desirable quantity
is not the q.in,

585
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,500
but it's the Q dot
out of this cycle.

586
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,459
So you have here
a Q dot out.

587
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:04,979
And that's the
heat rejected at

588
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:09,019
the higher temperature
divided by your w.in.

589
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:13,740
And so your Q dot out
is in the condenser,

590
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,219
that's dot H two
A minus H three,

591
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:24,899
and that's dot H
two A minus one.

592
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,110
Okay, get rid of
the end dots,

593
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,069
and you have it.

594
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:33,429
Okay? All right.

595
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:35,149
And the reason why this is

596
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:38,029
not a violation
of the first law.

597
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:42,349
It's instructive if
I come back to here

598
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:44,189
is if I drew

599
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:48,389
a control volume around
the entire system,

600
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:52,069
capturing how energy is

601
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:53,429
coming in and going out.

602
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:57,389
All right. So The way

603
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:58,910
that energy is
entering here,

604
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,069
so I write the first law

605
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:01,510
applied to this
control volume,

606
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,390
I have w.in plus q.in

607
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,549
is equal to Q
dot out, okay?

608
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:12,990
And so for you
to be able to

609
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,669
absorb something like
three units of heat in,

610
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,189
okay, for maybe like
one unit of work in,

611
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:21,190
it means that the sum

612
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,269
of those two
things must be

613
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,189
equal to the heat you

614
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:24,789
transfer out, okay, there.

615
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,349
So you'll have to
put more heat out,

616
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:27,790
but this is basically,

617
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,629
um, right, the trick

618
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:33,189
that we're dealing
with here, okay?

619
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:36,909
Um, Yeah,

620
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:38,030
and so you can rewrite

621
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,629
w.in also in another way.

622
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:41,789
I can say that w
dot N is equal to

623
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,270
q dot out minus q.in.

624
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,589
We'll use that
in a second.

625
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,109
All right. Mm hm.

626
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,189
All right.

627
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:09,910
So this is it.
So when you're

628
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,750
analyzing the vapor
compression cycle,

629
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,949
this is for the heat pump

630
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:16,350
or for the refrigeration.

631
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,029
This is the way you
do it, all right?

632
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:19,189
I've included
the whole part

633
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:21,950
on the isotropic
efficiency.

634
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,349
Like, that's it, all

635
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:25,589
right, for the
loop, right?

636
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,830
It's analogous here to,

637
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,189
like, the rank in
like we had before.

638
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:30,550
This is what you would
have for refrigeration

639
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,989
and then for heat pump.

640
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:33,429
Now, what we
can look at is

641
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:34,629
answering the second part

642
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:35,670
of our question, right?

643
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,349
So, this one is All right.

644
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:41,389
This one is done, okay?

645
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:44,070
Here was the COP
for the heat pump,

646
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,310
here is the COP
for refrigeration.

647
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,069
Now what we'd
like to do is

648
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,789
the Carne analysis, right?

649
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,789
So the COP for the
refrigerator is

650
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:59,909
equal to the
right, the q.in.

651
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,350
And this is at the
lower temperature.

652
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,069
What I'd like to
call this now is

653
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,549
Q dot L. This is how
the book describes it.

654
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:06,829
And our Q dot out

655
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:08,469
here that I'm rejecting
to the hot side,

656
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:12,369
I'd like to call
Q dot H. Okay,

657
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:15,009
so the desirable thing
in refrigeration is

658
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,570
an output is the Q
dot L, and the input,

659
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,049
as I wrote for the
first law here,

660
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:27,369
so this would then be
Q dot H minus Q dot L.

661
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:30,689
I'd have Q dot
L divided by

662
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:38,730
w dot N is equal to Q
dot L divided by Q dot.

663
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,169
Q dot minus Q
dot L, right?

664
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,009
Dividing top and the
bottom by Q dot L,

665
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:48,690
what you'd have
is one divided

666
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,329
by q dot H divided by

667
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:59,449
Q dot L and minus
one. All right.

668
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:02,530
And just like with Carne,

669
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,290
we would like to

670
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,849
transform these
into temperatures,

671
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:05,689
and that's what we're

672
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,569
going to do right
now, all right?

673
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,169
So for any cycle, right?

674
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:20,359
If I take the integral,

675
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,789
dQ by T here,

676
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,709
this must be less than or

677
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,109
equal to zero, okay?

678
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:32,629
In the case when
this equals

679
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:34,909
dq divided by T is

680
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:36,990
equal then to
zero for a cycle.

681
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,190
So this is basically
the integral

682
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,429
right around the
entire cycle.

683
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:40,749
When this is
equal to zero,

684
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:45,109
this is when it's operating
reversibly, okay?

685
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:48,269
Good. Are you with
me? All right.

686
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:52,809
For our process, Right?

687
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:54,169
Our heat exchange is

688
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:56,289
happening from two
thermal reservoirs.

689
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,769
So, if it's a thermal
reservoir, right?

690
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,690
I can pull the temperature

691
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,809
outside of the integral.

692
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:04,410
And what I'm going to
be dealing with is

693
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,690
a heat addition and
a heat removal.

694
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,050
When I'm doing
heat removal,

695
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,450
right, that's going
to be negative.

696
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,890
When I'm doing
heat addition,

697
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:16,409
that's going to be
positive, right?

698
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:23,599
So here, I have Q dot
L divided by T, okay?

699
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,319
I guess we'll write
that as rate format,

700
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,239
but we can do
this as a Q dot L

701
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,800
divided by T
because that's

702
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,719
right this is being
transferred in, right?

703
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,319
So my convention
will be that way.

704
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,839
And then this is from T L.

705
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,839
So imagine here in
this process that this

706
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,359
is a thermal reservoir

707
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,080
that's here that's a TL,

708
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,359
and then imagine
that I have

709
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,480
a thermal reservoir where

710
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,639
I'm transferring
heat into,

711
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:53,519
which is at H, right?

712
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,920
So then this is
basically going to be

713
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,240
Q dot H divided by my H.

714
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,560
And because this is
a reversible cycle,

715
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,040
that's going to
be equal to zero.

716
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,480
Can rearrange this?

717
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,759
If we rearrange this,

718
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,799
we can write this as
a Q dot H divided by

719
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:18,880
a Q dot L is equal to
a H divided by a tl.

720
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,439
What that means
then for the COP

721
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:24,280
of my refrigeration cycle,

722
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,159
so this is equal to

723
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,880
one over now with
the substitution,

724
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,929
H divided by l minus
one. All right.

725
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:39,169
You can do the
same thing you

726
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:40,409
can do the same analysis.

727
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:41,649
You can write the COP for

728
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:44,009
the heat pump in
the same way,

729
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:46,169
except instead of dot L,

730
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:49,090
it's dot H. And
what you'll

731
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,929
have then is one
minus Q dot L

732
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,329
divided by Q dot H.

733
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,969
And you go through
this, same process.

734
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:58,650
The COP for a heat
pump operating

735
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,970
reversibly is
then equal to 1/1

736
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,570
minus L divided by

737
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:12,959
H. So what does this
look like here?

738
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,479
All right. So what
I'm showing here

739
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:18,439
is just for the case of
the heat pump, right?

740
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:22,919
So I have here the
Carne efficiency of

741
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,200
the heat pump
as a function

742
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,599
of the outdoor
temperature, okay?

743
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,239
So in this case,
that's TL, right?

744
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:33,639
The horizontal line is
when it equals to one,

745
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,159
when I have a COP of one,

746
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,639
and the red line is

747
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:39,679
what I'm writing
here, okay?

748
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,039
Again, it never gets
to I don't know.

749
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,989
This is pretty
rare. Here, okay?

750
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:47,749
So if you're in,
like, Berkeley and in

751
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:48,669
the winter and stuff and

752
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:49,869
you're looking
at, you know,

753
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:51,429
whether a system like
this makes sense,

754
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:52,949
at 0 Celsius, you

755
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:54,629
have a COP that's
greater than ten, right?

756
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:56,189
So one unit of
electricity in,

757
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:58,149
I move ten units
of heat, okay?

758
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:00,069
Of course, that's the
upper limit, right?

759
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,149
That's a
theoretical thing,

760
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,550
but this kind
of tells you,

761
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,109
you know, you're
cooking with

762
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,909
something special
here, right?

763
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:08,279
Um realistic systems that

764
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,600
operate in the
neighborhood,

765
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,559
I think of three
to 54 COPs here,

766
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,040
which we'll do in
the next analysis.

767
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,720
We'll go in and
look at a real one.

768
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,559
But that's the
promise of it, okay?

769
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,600
When you try to pump heat

770
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,520
in from things
that are colder,

771
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,879
at some point, it
becomes very difficult.

772
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:26,599
So in real operations
of heat pump systems.

773
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,559
So in my beloved Midwest,

774
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,759
out there in the winter,

775
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,440
there are times when
the temperature gets

776
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,320
so low that it's
impractical.

777
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,759
And fortunately,
at that point,

778
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,039
you switch over from
pumping heat to

779
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,119
essentially running
the electricity

780
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,654
through a resistor
and heating that way.

781
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:42,789
Okay, so there are
cutoffs and with it,

782
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:44,149
but in a lot of
locations that

783
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:46,110
are more mild but
kind of chilly,

784
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,549
these things make
a lot of sense

785
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,869
to install, right?

786
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:50,749
Just economic sense
before you get into

787
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:51,949
decarbonization or

788
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,669
any considerations
like that, okay?

789
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:56,349
Are there any
questions about this?

790
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:04,189
Okay. If not, we
will continue.

791
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,629
Dick do, dick, do.

792
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:12,189
I I can leave this up.

793
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:22,139
This one, I can
also leave up,

794
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:24,780
and this one can go away.

795
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,259
Okay. So in this problem,

796
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:43,979
what we have is we're
working with R 134 A.

797
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,459
Okay, we're working
with R 134 A.

798
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:50,579
Again, just a refrigerant.

799
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:53,380
The R stands for
refrigerant.

800
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:58,180
R 134 A, you're
told that you have

801
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:04,340
a condenser pressure
condenser pressure

802
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:13,379
that's equal to 800
pa. And you have

803
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:19,539
an evaporator
temperature evaporator

804
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:23,099
temp that's equal to

805
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:33,749
-20 degrees C. We want
to determine What do

806
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:36,870
we want to
determine the COP

807
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,949
of this system and

808
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:44,190
the total

809
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:50,949
power total power

810
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:56,549
required to service

811
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:07,730
a 150 kilowatt
cooling load.

812
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,529
All right.

813
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,770
So here we're saying
cooling load.

814
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,170
Sometimes with
these systems,

815
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:13,969
when you speak
about, like,

816
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,050
chillers, they'll

817
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,290
talk about tons
of chilling.

818
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,770
And all that means
is that, like in

819
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,770
1 hour at that
cooling load,

820
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,329
you can produce,
like, one ton of ice.

821
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:23,409
You have a very nice
homework problem

822
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:25,169
that deals with
ice production,

823
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,489
slury production
there. Yeah.

824
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:28,889
But here, we're,
you know, we're

825
00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:30,090
keeping it simple
and calling

826
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,009
it a a cooling
load. All right.

827
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:37,459
Um, Okay, so again,

828
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:38,619
this is our
system, so we have

829
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,099
aw.in the compressor,

830
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:41,579
our heat out through
the condenser,

831
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:43,779
isothalpic
throttling valve,

832
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:47,540
heat heat absorbed
by our evaporator.

833
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,139
This cooling load here,

834
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:51,299
right, is essentially
than that, right?

835
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,380
This is basically we're

836
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,019
looking for, you know,

837
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:55,099
we have a Q dot
L that's then

838
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:58,285
equal to 150 kilowatts.

839
00:33:58,285 --> 00:34:00,310
Um, what's the total power

840
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,909
required to do
this, right?

841
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,230
Essentially, what
we're looking

842
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,789
for is on aw.in.

843
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:07,030
So we're searching
for the w.in,

844
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,709
and to do this,

845
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:11,669
we need to know the
Q dot L divided by

846
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:17,109
w.in or Q dot
L divided by Q

847
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:28,369
dot H minus Q dot
dot L. A. Mm hmm.

848
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:30,089
All right. And so
we're going to

849
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:30,689
go through now is

850
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,129
essentially the
states, right?

851
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:34,489
Because we have our
governing formulas there.

852
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,289
We've already
derived, then

853
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:38,610
the COP of the
refrigeration cycle.

854
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,449
So the answer to
the first part

855
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,529
is here, okay?

856
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:46,569
So that's what we want.

857
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:49,009
And the answer to

858
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:56,569
the second part is
our q.in, right?

859
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:57,849
So this is a Q dot N,

860
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:00,969
which is our Q
dot L, okay?

861
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,209
All right. And
so the name of

862
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:05,049
the game is we need
to determine, right?

863
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:07,169
So to go along with this,

864
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:09,809
we need to determine
the states there,

865
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:13,769
and we also have to
determine our MDOT.

866
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:15,569
So from the beginning.
So state three,

867
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:17,729
we can start from
state three.

868
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:26,609
Okay. So state three
is at the exit of,

869
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,089
give me a quick
second here.

870
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:30,609
So yeah, state three

871
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:32,409
is at the exit of
your condenser.

872
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:33,609
And just like we
said before, for

873
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,649
the rankin cycle
in a condenser,

874
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:37,049
right, the exit
state should

875
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:38,130
be a saturated liquid.

876
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,489
So we have an X three,
which is there,

877
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:43,209
and the pressure
is given, right?

878
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:44,489
So the pressure
was given in

879
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:48,919
the problem as 800 KPA,

880
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:51,440
S R 134 is a
pure substance,

881
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,639
it means that you
know H three, right?

882
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,959
We know H three out of it.

883
00:35:56,959 --> 00:36:00,839
For state four, if we
go to state four now.

884
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,719
Okay, so for state four,

885
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:08,320
this is going across
the expansion valve.

886
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,319
So H four is
equal to H three.

887
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:15,439
All right. We'll pause
for a second on that.

888
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:20,269
We'll skip ahead now
to State State one.

889
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:22,789
So for state one, this

890
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,589
is at the exit of
the evaporator.

891
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:24,869
Again,

892
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:26,789
just like the condenser
at the evaporator,

893
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:28,269
you're going to
expect it to be as

894
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,589
a saturated vapor,
right, evaporation.

895
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,709
So that should
be equal to one.

896
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:37,429
And we're given the
temperature here.

897
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,229
So the temperature we were

898
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:41,149
told of the evaporator

899
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:46,179
is -20 Celsius, -20.

900
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,939
Celsius is then
evaporation,

901
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,620
and that could be
the temperature

902
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,219
right anywhere
along this, right?

903
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:53,979
This is essentially
a boiling process,

904
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,899
so you have constant
temperature and

905
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:58,860
constant pressure
through that device.

906
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,859
So here you have this
and you have that,

907
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:02,419
which means that you have

908
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:06,219
specific entropy and
specific enthalpy there.

909
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:07,899
And additionally, you also

910
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:10,704
have the pressure
at P one.

911
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:12,749
If you look back now from

912
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:13,869
state one to state

913
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:15,229
four of the
evaporator, right?

914
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:16,350
It's a heat exchaner,

915
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,790
a constant
pressure device.

916
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,749
What this means
is that P four

917
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:22,709
is equal to P one,
which we have there.

918
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:24,949
So we have states
three, four, and one.

919
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:28,029
Our remaining one
is then for state.

920
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,709
State two, we call
it state two S.

921
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,429
So for state two S,

922
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:37,029
in the isotropic case,

923
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:38,709
through the
compressor, little S

924
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:40,949
two is equal to
little S one.

925
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:41,909
I'm not going to write out

926
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:43,230
the whole entropy
analysis.

927
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,629
We've done this enough
times, but again,

928
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:47,469
it's an adiabatic
compressor

929
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:48,709
operating reversibly.

930
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:51,189
So, um, steady flow

931
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:52,989
of ice and no change
in entropy in there.

932
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:54,190
And because it's
reversible,

933
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,550
we don't have any
entropy generation.

934
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,150
A single inlet,
single outlet.

935
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,229
That's what you
end up with.

936
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,109
That's at state two S.

937
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:04,629
And the other piece
of information that

938
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,709
we would have is
that state two and

939
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:07,830
state three are connected

940
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,109
via a heat exchanger.

941
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:13,269
So then P two is
equal to P three,

942
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:16,109
which was given as
800 kPa, right?

943
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:18,749
And so from this, what
you'll have is you'll

944
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:23,149
have h2s from here.

945
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:25,110
Since this is the ideal

946
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,270
vapor compression cycle,

947
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,709
we're not given, you know,

948
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,190
we don't have
any indication

949
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,829
or we're not told
anything about

950
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:37,629
the efficiency of
our compressor.

951
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:39,989
And so what we
would infer then is

952
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:44,229
that the efficiency
is 100%, right?

953
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:49,749
So what that means
is that, this H two,

954
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:52,749
what this means for if
I have a compressor,

955
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,510
efficiency equal to 100%,

956
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,550
it means that H two actual

957
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,029
is equal to h2s, okay?

958
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:01,509
Or you can just call
it H two, right?

959
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm being like, you
know, very detailed,

960
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,219
you know, with the
logic and how you might

961
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,300
see a problem in the
future. So it's ideal.

962
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,779
It means that
my isentropic

963
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:11,739
efficiency of the
compressor 100%.

964
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:14,539
So then the enthropy
at the exit of

965
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:15,699
that compressor is equal

966
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:18,899
to the isotropic one.

967
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,619
Okay.

968
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,699
Yeah, so at this point,

969
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,020
it's just plug and chug.

970
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,699
So to get to our COP,

971
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:33,689
so the COP There.
All right.

972
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:36,449
What we'd be
substituting in for,

973
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:39,689
right is our H H two A,

974
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:40,569
which is, of course,

975
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:42,569
H twoS and then the H one.

976
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:45,369
In this case,
what I have for

977
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:51,169
my COP is 3.83 as a
value with substitution.

978
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:52,090
And again, this falls

979
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,090
between what would
be expected.

980
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,449
So 3-5 is a good number.

981
00:39:56,449 --> 00:39:57,969
There is work
that goes on now

982
00:39:57,969 --> 00:39:59,409
that tries to bring
these things up to ten,

983
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:01,169
but they don't involve
vapor compression,

984
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:01,409
right?

985
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:03,209
So this is what you'd
have with this.

986
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,329
We also have is
there a question?

987
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:13,889
Yes, please. It's state

988
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:18,209
one? No.

989
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,170
It's a closed loop cycle.

990
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,449
So think like
Rankin, right?

991
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:22,970
In our Rankin systems,

992
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,329
we were operating
between what tens of

993
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:28,889
PA to tens of megapascals.

994
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:30,769
So we were going
all the way

995
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,649
between below

996
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:35,009
atmospheric pressure
to well above it.

997
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:36,369
It's the same thing here.

998
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,249
So don't have
an expectation

999
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:39,369
that the thing
has anything

1000
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:40,449
to do with ambient.

1001
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:41,969
Okay. I will note that
for something like

1002
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:44,329
R 134 A in the
compression process,

1003
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:46,450
you don't have to go to
crazy high pressures,

1004
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,649
maybe like a couple of

1005
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:49,929
times atmospheric
pressure,

1006
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:52,369
there, but you have a
big pressure drop to

1007
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,769
four to cause you to
boil and do that.

1008
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:56,209
I don't know what the
pressure is here,

1009
00:40:56,209 --> 00:41:00,209
but I can't say that
it's atmospheric, okay?

1010
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,129
And that's our 134 A.

1011
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:03,809
If you do something
like carbon dioxide,

1012
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:05,009
the pressure that
you have here can

1013
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,169
be like 100 bar,

1014
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:07,530
120 times

1015
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,489
atmospheric pressure
for a system like that,

1016
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:11,849
which then makes
them a little

1017
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:14,029
more sometimes
difficult to

1018
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:15,229
handle because
then you have

1019
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:17,789
very large systems that
are at high pressure.

1020
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:19,069
But there's no indication,

1021
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:20,309
that this is
something like a

1022
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:21,790
Brayton where the inlet

1023
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,589
would be
atmospheric, okay?

1024
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:26,709
It is interesting to

1025
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:27,389
think about that, though,

1026
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:29,549
to run a refrigeration
cycle on air.

1027
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:31,589
Maybe a good final
exam problem, right?

1028
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,350
It doesn't involve
property tables.

1029
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,989
Seriously, I'm going
to think about that.

1030
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:40,860
Okay. All right.
Other questions?

1031
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,489
No.

1032
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:48,889
Okay, so to get our
dot, what do we do?

1033
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:51,849
We can look at the loads.

1034
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:53,409
So we know the
Q dot L, right?

1035
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:56,409
We're told information
about the Q dot L

1036
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,009
there for the second part.

1037
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,809
And so Q dot L

1038
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:04,929
is equal to the
mass flow rate,

1039
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:10,690
right into our evaporator
times Little QL.

1040
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,929
What is little QL?

1041
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,129
This is nothing but,

1042
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:14,769
you know what I
wrote before.

1043
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:19,609
This will be
one minus four.

1044
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:22,729
We rearrange this. Our dot

1045
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:25,689
is equal to Q dot L

1046
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:32,759
divided by H one
minus H four.

1047
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:37,399
So given it's 150 kilowatts
H one and H four,

1048
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:39,159
we've determined from here

1049
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:44,519
and here, H four
that we know.

1050
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:45,839
And from this, you can see

1051
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:46,959
for the mass flow rate,

1052
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:48,719
what I have is about a
kilogram per second.

1053
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,029
So 1.05
kilograms/second is

1054
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,549
what I have. And
what's the power?

1055
00:42:56,549 --> 00:43:00,549
So the power now
to service this,

1056
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:05,269
we can say is w
dot N is equal

1057
00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:09,509
to Q dot minus Q dot L.

1058
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:10,789
Again, Q dot L is a

1059
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,549
given given in
our problem.

1060
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:15,349
Our Q dot H is then
going to be the dot,

1061
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:16,589
which we just
determined, and

1062
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:17,749
where's Q dot H,

1063
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:21,430
that's going to be a minus

1064
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:26,909
our three minus Q dot L.

1065
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,779
Okay. And if
you substitute

1066
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:35,259
the numbers in for that,

1067
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:38,019
I have a power
requirement that is

1068
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:41,619
approximately 39
kilowatts, right?

1069
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:46,499
So our w.in here
is 39 kilowatts.

1070
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,059
And again, just to
remind you that

1071
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:52,699
39 is much less
than the 150,

1072
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,499
and that's why
we bother with

1073
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,860
teaching this and learning

1074
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,179
about it and using it.

1075
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,059
Okay?

1076
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:05,139
Questions. Among the
simpler cycles, okay?

1077
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:09,059
Good. That's how
it looks like.

1078
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:10,380
So you can do some plots.

1079
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,949
So the way Um,

1080
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:16,869
so I show you here
a PV diagram.

1081
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:18,509
Here's a pH in this field,

1082
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:20,349
it's pretty common to
present these things on

1083
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:23,709
pressure specific
enthalpy diagrams, right?

1084
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:24,709
If we go three to four

1085
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:25,829
through the
expansion valve,

1086
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,229
you can see that
that process

1087
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:29,269
is indeed isomthalpic.

1088
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:31,109
Through that four
to one, right,

1089
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:32,309
the enthalpy is increasing

1090
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:33,269
because you're boiling or

1091
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:35,869
you're boiling until
you a saturated vapor.

1092
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:38,429
You compress it
isotropically,

1093
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:40,469
and then you
condense, right?

1094
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,549
You condense through here,

1095
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:43,829
and then when
you're beneath the,

1096
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:46,879
you know, during that, um,

1097
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:49,209
the connotation is
happening inside of

1098
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:51,409
a heat exchanger and
heat exchange isobaric,

1099
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:53,089
you'd expect from
state two S here to

1100
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:55,409
state three to be
constant pressure, okay?

1101
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:58,130
So it's a pH.

1102
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,929
And yes, if there
are no questions,

1103
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:05,489
I will give you 5
minutes on this well,

1104
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:08,009
4 minutes on this
lovely day, okay?

1105
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,609
I'm up here if you
have questions.

1106
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:11,169
Thank you, everyone.
