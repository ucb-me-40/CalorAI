1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Um, okay, so today,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,560
we're going to continue
with the energy,

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,800
basically energy transfer.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,160
We'll do a couple
more examples.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,760
Throw one to you
guys also to show

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,480
me if you know what

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,040
you're talking
about, all right?

8
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,960
Yeah,

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,840
so we'll talk about
the concept of work,

10
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,560
electrical work and forms
of mechanical work.

11
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,480
We'll get more into
the first law.

12
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,920
I'll take you
through kind of

13
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,040
a very detailed problem

14
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,000
solving approach for
a first law problem.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,560
You know, if time permits,

16
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,840
we'll get a little
bit of the fluid

17
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,400
flowing as
energy transfer.

18
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,720
Okay? So examples of,
like, mechanical work.

19
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,160
I mean, this should be for

20
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,640
mechanical engineers.

21
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,440
Not a slide I
need to present.

22
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,810
Um, All right,

23
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,770
like one of them is
essentially here.

24
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,930
I'm applying a force

25
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,090
basically over a distance.

26
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,370
So in this example, right,

27
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,330
the force I'm applying
is when I'm pushing.

28
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,250
What's resisting me is

29
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,250
essentially inertia
and friction.

30
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,770
And if I displace it
an amount S there,

31
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,090
right, it's going to
be FS is the work.

32
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,890
Another important form
that we'll go into,

33
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,250
especially when
it comes to

34
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,765
engines is what's
called shaft work.

35
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:03,240
Okay? So if you
think about,

36
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,040
like, everything in
a car, a turbine,

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,360
pretty much how
we produce all of

38
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,560
our electricity that's not

39
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
solar based
comes from this.

40
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,800
So just keep that
in your mind.

41
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,640
That's going to
come up in, like,

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,000
in Week five, okay?

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,160
So a quick example before

44
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,160
I turn it over to you.

45
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,200
So this, like I said,

46
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,480
should be very familiar.

47
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,320
So I have some
surface here.

48
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,400
I have a spring. Let's say

49
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,160
maybe there's a mass
on the end of it.

50
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,320
Um And when it's
at equilibrium,

51
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,080
let's say C 85
equilibrium, right?

52
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,880
It's not moving. It's
a rest position, okay?

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,040
And if I want to displace

54
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,280
that, you know,
from that position,

55
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,680
I'm going to have
to apply a force,

56
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,000
which means that I'm
going to, you know,

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,120
essentially be
transferring transferring

58
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,480
work into the into the
system, all right?

59
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,190
Um, So the way that
we write this,

60
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,630
right, for F is
Hook's law, right?

61
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,230
So what we
basically say from

62
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,150
our buddy hook is

63
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,750
that the amount
that we displace,

64
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,870
let's call it,
let's say X is

65
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,470
proportional to a
constant, right?

66
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,390
So this holds for things

67
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,630
like metals, you know,

68
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,590
other materials,
No hook in,

69
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,310
and so on and so

70
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,670
forth for our
purposes, right?

71
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,910
So force is linearly
proportional

72
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,750
to, uh, to displacement.

73
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,590
So we can take

74
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,710
that and put that
up into there.

75
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,110
So we go with
our D, right?

76
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,150
Our dw is then equal to

77
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,350
our K X, um, dx there.

78
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,870
We can go on and
we can integrate.

79
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,870
Let's say from
zero to X, right?

80
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,630
So let's say for this,

81
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,830
this could be
like from state

82
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,790
one to state two.

83
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,150
So this is state one,

84
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,710
then state two is
somewhere down here.

85
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,510
If I'm integrating
from zero to X,

86
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,830
I'll put like a
till day over here

87
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,470
because these are

88
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,910
the variables
of integration.

89
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,480
Um with it.

90
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
And so out of this then,

91
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,640
what you'll have
is a 1.5 right K,

92
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
because it's a constant,

93
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
so we can take that out

94
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,320
of our integral, right?

95
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,840
So that's one
half K X squared.

96
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,000
And what we assume in

97
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,360
this process that we do it

98
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,480
is that we basically
pull slowly,

99
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,590
right, what's called
reversible, okay?

100
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,220
Alright, so we basically
displace this,

101
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,700
and not really quickly,
we go, you know,

102
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,660
bit by bit and, you know,

103
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,060
pull and we apply this,

104
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,900
you know, to this point
to get to this force.

105
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,620
Maybe we add, like,
little weights

106
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,940
each time until
we end up with

107
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,780
that full force at
that position, okay?

108
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,900
Great.

109
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,580
If we wanted to do, right,

110
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,940
an energy
analysis of that.

111
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,500
So I just wrote
that as a DW.

112
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,460
Let's say we drew here's

113
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,360
my bluet Unbelievable.

114
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,600
Okay, here it
is. All right.

115
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,960
So if we drew, like,

116
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,520
a control volume, right,

117
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,560
let's say around
this, okay?

118
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,600
And let's say we're doing
that work transfer,

119
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,120
like, right at
this interface.

120
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,110
What we can write is Okay,

121
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,310
that the change
in the energy

122
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,630
in that control
volume, right?

123
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,590
So the Delta, let's
call it Delta,

124
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,710
let's call it Delta
E. We can call it CV.

125
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,790
We can call it Delta
E system, right?

126
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,750
It's going to be
equal to, right,

127
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,910
the E in minus
the E out, okay?

128
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,020
It's like, Okay.

129
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,060
Um, making sure
nothing's following.

130
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,380
Everyone's
standing and knock

131
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,660
and ye, at that equation.

132
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,580
Okay. So, what are

133
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,980
the ways that we
can, you know,

134
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,580
that energy can change

135
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,700
and control volume
like that, right?

136
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,020
We're talking normally

137
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,020
about, internal energy.

138
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,620
We could talk about
kinetic energy,

139
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,580
or we could talk

140
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,750
about potential
energy, okay?

141
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,760
So Delta U, that's clear.

142
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,040
We went through it
before. KE. These are

143
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,200
not two separate
variables.

144
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
This is the
book's notation,

145
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,680
Delta meaning change,
kinetic E energy.

146
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,040
And the same for
potential on

147
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,760
a Delta PE there.

148
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,240
All right. And then this

149
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
would be equal to what?

150
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,800
So what are the ways
we can transfer energy

151
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,880
in will work, right?

152
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,280
So we can have W in,

153
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,200
or we could have
Q in, right?

154
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,800
And then this would
be subtracted by,

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,840
write a W out plus
a Q out, all right?

156
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
All right.

157
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,800
So, all right, so we
have our schematic.

158
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,280
We drew a boundary
condition, um, you know,

159
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,880
here, I told you my
problem statement,

160
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,000
you know, I made
some assumptions.

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,760
We did our physical laws,

162
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,520
we apply, you know,
the hook law to it.

163
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,400
We did the first law
of thermodynamics.

164
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,280
All right.

165
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,440
So if we come back
to the assumptions,

166
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,240
we could say here,
for example,

167
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,960
um, that, you know,

168
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,600
maybe the internal
energy of

169
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,720
this system is not
changing, right?

170
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,480
So we could say
things like,

171
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,040
you know, that there.
So that could be out.

172
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,600
And we could say
here that if it

173
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
went really, really
slowly, probably,

174
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
then our kinetic energy

175
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,200
that we have there also

176
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,320
wouldn't change, you know?

177
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,480
But you can anticipate

178
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
because this is a spring,

179
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
that there would
be a change

180
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
in the potential
energy there, right?

181
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,480
That's usually what you do

182
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
with the spring, right?

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,450
Um, We can also

184
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,130
say here that there's
no heat transfer.

185
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,890
So if you looked at
that, probably, again,

186
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,850
if you went
very, you know,

187
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,050
slowly with it,

188
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,570
you wouldn't be
having any sort

189
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,810
of heat transfer
associated with it.

190
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,330
And my question
to you is this?

191
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,410
That is, like, insane.

192
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,730
That is not reversible,
what they're doing.

193
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,970
So does this
look like a work

194
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,890
in process or a
workout process?

195
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:50,810
This side of the room.
Up is a direction.

196
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,050
I want to know in or out.

197
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,450
Okay. Louder. In,
yes, it's a work in.

198
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,850
Okay. It's like a referee.

199
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,730
You give me the
signals there.

200
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,370
Okay, right? Yeah,
so it's a work in.

201
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,250
There is a no work
transferred out.

202
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,770
So then here from
this problem,

203
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,250
what you would have right

204
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,210
here is that the change in

205
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,210
the potential energy of

206
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,890
that system is
then equal to

207
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,690
the work transferred in.

208
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,770
And that's exactly what

209
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,930
we would have
here then, right?

210
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,570
So this W in is
there. Okay?

211
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,050
And then I think at
the end of this,

212
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,930
you're supposed to then

213
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,770
what are you
supposed to do?

214
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,490
The book says, give
me some reasoning,

215
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,290
you know, I mean,
you did some work.

216
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,090
You stretch something out.

217
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:38,210
Yeah, that's some
reasoning, okay? Good.

218
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,650
Alright, what would happen

219
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,090
if instead of doing
that very slowly,

220
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,690
I pulled that
spring very fast?

221
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,970
What would you expect
to happen there?

222
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,490
Anyone ever taken a

223
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,370
rubber band and,
like, do that?

224
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,370
So did a rubber band,

225
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,250
and you stretch that
really, really quickly,

226
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,450
as it get hotter
or colder.

227
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,090
Hotter. Do you know why?

228
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,860
So in the rubber
band, right,

229
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,180
you have lots of

230
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,100
polymers in their
chains, okay?

231
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,820
And it turns out when
you stretch them out,

232
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,900
you force those chains

233
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,700
to become more ordered.

234
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
They become more
aligned there, okay?

235
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,540
We'll get later into
what that means.

236
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,660
But basically, when
things suddenly go

237
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,100
from kind of chaotic
to very ordered,

238
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,620
there's
consequences to it.

239
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,860
And one of the
consequences

240
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,260
is if I do that
really quick,

241
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,740
the system will warm up.

242
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,860
And some people look

243
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,460
nowadays at actually
using that to,

244
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,900
like, run
refrigeration cycles.

245
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,500
So are called

246
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,900
solid state
refrigerators in that.

247
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,780
Yes, please. Why
did you take

248
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,620
a small you're
going to learn.

249
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,060
At the end of this
class, you're going

250
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,460
to be able to answer
that beautifully.

251
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,860
You go to your parents
and say, yes, this is.

252
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,780
Okay. But the answer

253
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,620
is in short entropy, okay?

254
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,220
All right.

255
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,900
Any questions about
this? Yes, please.

256
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,900
Squiggle X.

257
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,660
So you do this
because I want to

258
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,540
integrate to X as a limit.

259
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,140
And so in order to
do that correctly,

260
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,340
I'm told I'm thinking

261
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,940
back years now
into my calculus,

262
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,140
but you put a squiggle

263
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,820
for a variable
of integration.

264
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,980
So I can't just
write like a limit

265
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,900
of X and then
also dx, I think.

266
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,055
Yes, please.

267
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:17,970
It one more time
energy negative form.

268
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,370
In this problem? Yeah.

269
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,770
Yeah, so, you know,

270
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,130
it's a fair statement.

271
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,410
So I'm saying it's as
an assumption, okay?

272
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,850
So we can challenge and

273
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,210
look at the assumption.

274
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,570
In here and stretching
the spring,

275
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,890
if I do that
really so we can

276
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,210
look at the outside
environment,

277
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,530
I'm not changing
the temperature

278
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,970
of the outside of the
environment, right?

279
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,890
One, two, I'm also not
changing the pressure,

280
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,650
right on the outside
of this environment

281
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,435
or anywhere there, right?

282
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:47,820
Okay. So when we
looked at the energy,

283
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,180
when we talked about
internal energy,

284
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,900
we basically said
internal energy basically

285
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
depends on only two
properties there, right?

286
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,700
Let's say temperature
and pressure,

287
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,660
pressure and
volume, you know,

288
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,220
volume and
temperature there.

289
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,860
So, in that case,
it wouldn't

290
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,500
be implausible to
say for that case,

291
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,100
I assume that these things

292
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,220
these state properties
aren't changing.

293
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,540
Therefore, I wouldn't have

294
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,900
an expectation
of a change in

295
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,670
thermal energy there.

296
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,120
Okay. To be blunt, though,

297
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,400
and to be clear,
right, if,

298
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,880
like, the
temperature, right?

299
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,160
The most important
factor there

300
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,440
would basically be
the temperature.

301
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,640
If I'm not changing the

302
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,120
temperature of
that system,

303
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,240
I probably wouldn't have

304
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
an expectation of changing

305
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,800
the internal energy base

306
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,440
of the thermal
energy. Okay?

307
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,305
Good question.
Other questions?

308
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:30,610
You're on it for Friday.

309
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,970
I'm happy. Okay.
All right.

310
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,850
Cool. So that's
our spring.

311
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:42,050
Now what I want to do
is show you a spring,

312
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:48,090
another kind of spring,
basically a bubble.

313
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,090
So here what you
have while you

314
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,330
have a soap solution here.

315
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,890
You suspend that solution

316
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,130
between a frame, right?

317
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,730
There's basically this
rigid blue frame here,

318
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,530
and you pull, right?

319
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,570
So you basically
pull, right?

320
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,930
We basically pull
on that there.

321
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,370
And what you see
is I stretch

322
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,970
it down just like
the spring before.

323
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,290
And like any other spring,

324
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,650
it restores back to
where it was, right?

325
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,490
It's like, out
kindergarten,

326
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,770
first grade
days, you know,

327
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,170
for the bubble lovers,
maybe yesterday.

328
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,410
But yeah, so essentially,

329
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,410
you know, there
you see that

330
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,970
right I play this force.

331
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,650
And then when I
release it, right,

332
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,170
it goes back to
roughly where

333
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,140
it came from, okay?

334
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,390
So I want so given this,

335
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,070
given your experiences
in kindergarten,

336
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,670
I want you to analyze
this system, okay?

337
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,110
So you take here
a thin soap film,

338
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,950
and the thickness of it

339
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,710
doesn't really
matter too much.

340
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,240
Um, The you may not
be aware of this,

341
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,560
but at the interface of

342
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
the liquid in the air,

343
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,360
that interface is
under tension, okay?

344
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,040
We call that surface
tension, right?

345
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
And that acts parallel

346
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,840
to the liquid
interface, right?

347
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,120
So here, the
surface tension

348
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,400
is pulling on that
kind of movable wire.

349
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,560
It's pulling it
back inwards, okay?

350
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,360
So at the surface
tension that's there,

351
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,040
the units of
surface tension are

352
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,410
newtons per meter, okay?

353
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,450
I want you to reflect
on what the units

354
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,490
of K were, you
know, over there.

355
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,010
That's good.
And you assume

356
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,210
that this is a
reversible process.

357
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,130
So I'm not doing very
fast movements, right?

358
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,010
Slow, right?

359
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,850
Slow movements there.
So two questions.

360
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,850
What's the formula
for force?

361
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,770
For those that don't
have a Greek phone,

362
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,130
you know, put for Sigma.

363
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,730
And what's the
formula then for

364
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,010
work done if I

365
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,890
stretch it over a
distance dx, okay?

366
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,330
So I said 10 minutes.

367
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,930
I think this
group needs five.

368
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,290
You look like smart today.

369
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,290
So go there, do this.
I'll circulate a bit,

370
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,810
submit the answer, and
then we'll discuss.

371
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,010
All right, if there's
no other questions,

372
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,690
then where did you

373
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,650
read about surface
tension and Gamma?

374
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,770
Where did you read about

375
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,170
surface tension
being Gamma?

376
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:16,900
Yeah. That's your
critical thinking.

377
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,740
I like that. Okay.
Yeah. All right. Okay.

378
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,420
All right. So
coming in, right.

379
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
So the mechanical is
one type of work.

380
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,380
Another common one
that's going to be

381
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,740
there that you'll observe

382
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,820
is the electrical work.

383
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,700
We looked over
this last time.

384
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,700
There was one question
that was about,

385
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
you know, whether it's
work or it's heat.

386
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,540
So in order for it

387
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,340
to be heat transfer,
what do we require?

388
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,060
Sure.

389
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,620
Temperature grade,

390
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,780
you need
temperature, right?

391
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,620
So in this problem here,

392
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,900
if I take right
a resistor,

393
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,260
I apply a potential
across it.

394
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,540
I'm going to
generate a current,

395
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,020
and I'm going to the

396
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,180
electrons are
going to move,

397
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,140
and it's going to heat
that resistor, okay?

398
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,340
Right, if you apply
enough voltage,

399
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,780
it'll start on fire,
and it's kind of fun.

400
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,300
So, so we have this
as a resistor,

401
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,020
right? We have
some voltage.

402
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,860
Right, that
we're applying.

403
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
So here's a resistor,
here's a voltage,

404
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,580
and you're going
to generate

405
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,500
a a current with that.

406
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,380
And let's say we do that

407
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,420
inside of a control
volume, right?

408
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,860
If I draw the
control volume

409
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,180
to look like this, right?

410
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,580
The electrons are
going to move

411
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,420
through that
boundary, okay?

412
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,220
And then this resistor

413
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,620
is then going to
get warm, okay?

414
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,100
But because it's
the electrons

415
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,220
crossing the boundary,

416
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,820
and then things get
hot inside of it,

417
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,300
that's a work
transfer process.

418
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,780
If on the other hand, you

419
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,860
decide to be wild and

420
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,690
draw a control volume,
like that, right?

421
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,330
This resistor is going
to get hot, okay?

422
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,810
And then it's going
to conduct or

423
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,290
transfer heat
into here, right?

424
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,130
And then that's a
heat transfer process

425
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,690
to this control volume.

426
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,410
So it's very important
how you draw

427
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,050
your boundaries can
sometimes dictate

428
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,490
the solutions that
you follow, okay?

429
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,450
So when you draw that,

430
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,810
you got to be consistent,

431
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,250
then from there
on after, okay?

432
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,925
Great.

433
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,360
All right, so we

434
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
talked about this
right with the,

435
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,040
um, you know,

436
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,520
the first law of
thermodynamics.

437
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,960
So it's a conservation
energy, right?

438
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,640
It's not created,
it's not destroyed.

439
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,520
You're just, you know,
transferring it.

440
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,040
And it's like
accounting, right?

441
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,200
Thermo is pretty much

442
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,560
from the first
law perspective,

443
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,000
is nothing but, you
know, accounting.

444
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,120
And the way that
I like, right,

445
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,720
the way that I like
to write this,

446
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,680
you know, because this is

447
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,040
sort of a simplified form.

448
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
The way that I always like

449
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,120
to star with it is, right,

450
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,320
there's the change
in the energy

451
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,600
in the control
volume, right?

452
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,880
That's your bank account.
That's your salary,

453
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,280
that's your
Safeway, right?

454
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,600
So here you basically have

455
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,360
the in minus the out,

456
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,950
you know, dictating
what's remaining.

457
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,060
Um, for problems
like this, right?

458
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,660
The way that we have
changes in the energy,

459
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,380
the control volume
or internal energy,

460
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,140
kinetic energy and
potential energy,

461
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,500
right, on the account.

462
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,940
And then the
ways that we can

463
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,380
transfer energy in and out

464
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,820
of such control volumes is

465
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,500
only through work
in heat, okay?

466
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,740
So, and I will, when
I write solutions,

467
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,900
always be writing Wn
W Q in and Q out.

468
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,580
I don't get into

469
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,460
this positive and
negative game.

470
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,270
When you do see it in
the book, though, Q,

471
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,870
without an in or an out,

472
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,150
you should
assume then it's

473
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,110
just an in, right?

474
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,030
Or when it's
positive, it's in,

475
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,350
when it's negative,
it's out, and then W,

476
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,870
when it's on the
right hand side,

477
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,910
when it's positive,

478
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,910
it's out, and when it's

479
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,750
in, it's negative, okay?

480
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,950
Cool, right?

481
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,390
And so just to
remind you what I

482
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,190
wrote there and what
we did last time,

483
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,270
again, at the
risk of being,

484
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,110
you know, really
a broken record.

485
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,230
With it, this is how
the case looks like

486
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,310
for a system with
no mass transfer,

487
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,230
what we call is
a closed system.

488
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,810
All right? Um, All

489
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,290
right, so it's a
closed system.

490
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,850
How much time do
I have? Sure.

491
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,570
Let's do one more example

492
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,970
on the ice core cooling,

493
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,130
and then I'll
get into sort of

494
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,050
the mass transfer
problem, okay?

495
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,090
So let me move this
back to the left board.

496
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,250
Oh, the right board.
That's great.

497
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,990
Do, do, do, do.

498
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,510
All right. Cool.

499
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,910
So in this problem,
we have a container.

500
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,790
This container is rigid,

501
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,150
so it's a rigid container.

502
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,750
And it's at some
initial state,

503
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,430
which is kind of

504
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,790
warm and at a
higher pressure.

505
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,150
And we're going
to cool it.

506
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,190
What is wrong with?

507
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,110
Okay, that's
where I want it.

508
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,910
Trouble is if I put
it in the middle,

509
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,150
there's a huge
reflection I

510
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,710
noticed last time.

511
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:10,150
Um All right, so we're
going to draw this,

512
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,310
you know, rigid container,

513
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,950
which is here, okay?

514
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,110
There's some mass there.

515
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,590
There's a T one, and
there's a P one.

516
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,550
And we're also told that
from this container,

517
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,470
so I'll draw my control
volume like this.

518
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,790
There's some Q out

519
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,110
that we would like
to determine.

520
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,590
So, given this, what
we want to determine.

521
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,830
So determine Okay,

522
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,790
we'd like to
know what T two,

523
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,230
and we'd like to know
what Q out is, okay?

524
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,710
So, that's good.

525
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,630
So I've drawn
my schematic.

526
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,070
My problem statement
is up there.

527
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,790
What am I assuming, okay?

528
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,380
Okay. So what's
in here is air.

529
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,260
Okay? And what I'm
going to assume

530
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,180
is that this behaves
like an ideal gas.

531
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,220
One. The second
thing that I'm

532
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,700
assuming is when
you see the word

533
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,180
rigid said about
the container,

534
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,740
that's like code for it

535
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,100
doesn't expand
and contract.

536
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,460
That's code for
your volume, right?

537
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Or let's say V
two big V two.

538
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,575
So the overall volume
is equal to B V one.

539
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:44,490
We're going to assume that

540
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,770
the container is also
impermeable, right?

541
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,010
Impermeable. What
does that mean?

542
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,890
It means no mass
in or out, okay?

543
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,890
And so what this
implies then is that

544
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,450
v2v2 divided by M

545
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,290
is equal to V one
divided by M, right?

546
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,130
So the specific
volume two is equal

547
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,530
to specific volume one,

548
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,130
and you're going
to neglect

549
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,810
changes in kinetic energy,

550
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,850
and you're going
to neglect changes

551
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,530
in potential
energy, right?

552
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,090
Cool. All right.

553
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,290
Good.

554
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,410
So we can write our
conservation of energy.

555
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,170
So here we can say,
right, the change

556
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,170
in the E of our system,

557
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:40,250
is equal to E in
minus our E out.

558
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,530
All right. Our E in then
is what W in plus Q

559
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:54,170
in minus W out plus Q out.

560
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,770
All right. The changes.

561
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,570
So one of the
ways that we can

562
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,610
have changes in
this in the system?

563
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,690
So that's how we can
transfer it, right?

564
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,050
But,

565
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,170
think about your
bank account,

566
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,010
your thermo account.

567
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,810
So, what are ways that

568
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,610
the energy can change
in a control volume?

569
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,260
So temperature, which is

570
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,660
then basically internal
energy, right?

571
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,740
So we can talk
about, you know,

572
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:30,180
Delta U plus Delta
E plus Delta P

573
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,420
is then going to be
equal to Wn plus Qn

574
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,020
minus W plus Q out.

575
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,500
From our assumptions
here, right?

576
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,260
We're going to neglect
kinetic energy.

577
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,220
We're going to
neglect changes

578
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,460
in potential
energy, right?

579
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,540
So that's going
to be equal to

580
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,340
our delta E system.

581
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,140
So we break that
down. Okay? Talk to

582
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,340
me about this formula.

583
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,540
So do we have work
transfer here for

584
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,580
an isochoric
process? No, okay?

585
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,300
So we have no W in
there and no W out.

586
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,900
What about Q in?

587
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,940
No, right? So we
just have that.

588
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,700
So at the end of it, so

589
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,340
our E in minus our E
out is nothing but,

590
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,380
um, Q out, right?

591
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,260
And the change in the
energy of the system

592
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,540
is only going
to be changes

593
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,780
in internal energy, right?

594
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,620
So basically,
Delta U is going

595
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,460
to be equal to Q out.

596
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,095
All right? Yes, please.

597
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:37,770
Negative.

598
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,330
You're on it, man.
I like that. Okay.

599
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,130
Right. Right?

600
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,890
This is a process
we're moving from

601
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,250
the plot that we see,
we're moving 1-2.

602
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,770
So estily this change in

603
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,930
internal energy
is U two minus

604
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,890
U one is equal to the
negative of our Q out.

605
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,690
All right.

606
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,130
Cool. Yeah, so
everything until now,

607
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,010
should make
sense. All right?

608
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,610
For an ideal gas,

609
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,730
what I'm going to
tell you right now,

610
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,730
I'm going to tell
you something.

611
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,050
I'll back it up
with an example,

612
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,890
and then we'll see

613
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,690
what time as we
go, all right?

614
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,410
Changes in the
internal energy

615
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,450
of an ideal gas only
depend on temperature,

616
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,210
okay? Not pressure, okay?

617
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,610
It's only temperature,
all right?

618
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,050
I'll back this up. You did

619
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,490
these simulations
of an ideal gas

620
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,690
with these particles
moving around.

621
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,770
Translational kinetic
energy, okay?

622
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,210
So it's only one half mv

623
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,690
squared for each
particle, right?

624
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,730
Okay. Um, This is good.

625
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,610
What I'm going to tell
you is that, like,

626
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,090
temperature is equal to

627
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,410
that energy times
a constant.

628
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,490
A constant is called

629
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,330
Boltzmann's
constant K, right?

630
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,330
So t is basically equal

631
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,810
to transition kinetic
energy, right?

632
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,050
Fine. Bear with me.

633
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,130
You'll see with
time, okay?

634
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,090
But the point
is that this is

635
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:06,970
kind of like lame to

636
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,930
stop here at U. I

637
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,690
want to go a little
bit further, right?

638
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,370
So some facts.

639
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,010
D is equal to the mass of

640
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,370
the substance involved for

641
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,930
an ideal gas
times a constant.

642
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,890
I'm just going to
call it C and give

643
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,130
it a little V. We'll
deal with that later.

644
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,210
N times dt, all right?

645
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,730
The units of CV here
have the units of

646
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,890
kilojoules per
kilogram per kelvin.

647
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,490
This is basically
a measure of if I

648
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,370
put some amount of
heat into a substance,

649
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,890
how much does this
temperature change?

650
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,330
It's very important,
and we're going

651
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,530
to we're going
to use it a lot.

652
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,970
So this applies
for ideal gas.

653
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,490
Alright. Alright, so if

654
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,170
we take this and
we put it to here,

655
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,530
what I can write is that

656
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,010
M times this
constant times

657
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,010
T two minus T one

658
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,410
is going to be equal to

659
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,330
negative Q out, all right?

660
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,210
And so now, with
that, right,

661
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,290
if we knew the mass,
which we're told,

662
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,810
if we knew the constant,

663
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,490
which I could
give you, okay?

664
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,250
And if we knew
the difference of

665
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,490
T minus T one,

666
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,570
we'd have to the
Q out, right?

667
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,090
So pretty much
until this point,

668
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,890
we've got our governing
equations good.

669
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,890
We've got how we're

670
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,570
going to get the solution,

671
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,490
and all we need to do now

672
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,810
is compute
properties, right?

673
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,650
That's the next stage

674
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,250
in our problem solution.

675
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,620
All right.

676
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,500
So how are we going

677
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,540
to compute the properties?

678
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,580
How do we compute
properties of an ideal gas?

679
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,620
Okay, I'll give
you that one.

680
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,100
So ideal gas
equation, right?

681
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,420
Idel gas equation,
all right?

682
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:05,990
So P vp1v1 is equal to,
which means the same.

683
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,470
R of air times
times T one.

684
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,950
We can put M to
the other side.

685
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,590
So we'll have P one.

686
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,870
Little V one is equal
to R air times T one.

687
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,150
This is not like
joules per mol Kelvin.

688
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,550
You can have these,
which are joules per

689
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,310
kilogram per

690
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,950
kelvin for, like,
all substances.

691
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,190
Alright? You can look
it up in your textbook.

692
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:35,850
Um Okay, we know P one,

693
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,650
we know T one,

694
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,250
we know R. We don't
know V one, right?

695
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,690
So the first step is
basically V one is R

696
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:45,530
A T one divided
by P one, right?

697
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,330
Cool. That's everything
for state one.

698
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,810
We have T one, we have
P one, we have V one.

699
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,570
Caput, all right?

700
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,170
Now we come to state two.

701
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,330
State two. What do we
know about state two?

702
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,930
What information is given?

703
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,450
Pressure, P two, okay?

704
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:09,530
So I can go p2v2 is
equal to R T two,

705
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,770
we'd like to find T two,

706
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,450
so T two is equal to

707
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,890
p2v2 divided

708
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,450
by R. So what don't
we know here?

709
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,770
R air, sorry.
R air, R air.

710
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,090
What don't we know on
the right hand side?

711
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,100
V two, similar or
identical, right?

712
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,300
So we know from from
over here, right?

713
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,940
This is little V two

714
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,820
is equal to little
V one, right?

715
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,860
Big V two is
equal to V V one.

716
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,060
The mass doesn't change.

717
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,220
Little V two is that.

718
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,780
And so what you'd
have here is then

719
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,660
V two, V one,

720
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,100
which we just
learned here,

721
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,620
divided by our air, okay?

722
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,175
With that, you have T two.

723
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,970
With then the T two,

724
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,210
you can plug it into here.

725
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,650
It's the negative
of the Q out,

726
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,450
but we can rewrite
this and say

727
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,170
the Q is equal
to the mass of

728
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,850
the air in the
control volume

729
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,370
times the constant
times T one,

730
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,050
which is the
hotter temperature

731
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,050
minus T two, okay?

732
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,250
And that's a
key part of it.

733
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,930
Because I've written
this as Q out,

734
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,610
this should just be a
positive number, right?

735
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,370
So if I did everything
right and I'm

736
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,170
doing a cooling
process, right,

737
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,050
I'd expect T two to be

738
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,210
lower than to T
one there, okay?

739
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,870
At least today, we got to

740
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,510
compute a temperature
in a heat, right?

741
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,670
Next time, you know,

742
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,150
we'll get a bit
further, right?

743
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,550
And then if you
click on this link,

744
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,310
you can go through some of

745
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,230
those numbers and see,

746
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,150
and that's what this
process looks like,

747
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,470
right?

748
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,110
And this is a straight
line up and down,

749
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,150
one to two on a
constant volume, okay?

750
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,510
With that, I'm
going to close.

751
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,190
I hope you all have
a great weekend.

752
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,470
I'm up here if you
have questions.
