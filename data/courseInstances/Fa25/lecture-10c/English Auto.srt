1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
All right, I got 210.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,320
Let's get started.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,200
All right, so we finished
our last lecture

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,840
today about vapor and
combined power cycles.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,570
Loud, loud. All right.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,329
So after today's lecture,

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,529
you'll be able to analyze

8
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,849
a combined gas
vapor power cycle

9
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:22,649
and analyze an ideal
cogeneration plant.

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:23,889
The way to think
about this

11
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:25,289
is until now, right,

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,529
we were putting heat in,

13
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:27,849
trying to get work out,

14
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,209
and then rejecting
the heat.

15
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:30,730
All right. We had
some efficiency.

16
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,329
And the question that
was asked before was,

17
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,369
how does one improve

18
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:38,529
the efficiencies
of these cycles?

19
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:40,409
And in short,
what you want

20
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:41,209
to do is you want to

21
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,529
squeeze out every
last bit of,

22
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:43,769
like, Q in that you,

23
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:45,669
um, that you can.

24
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:46,949
We've looked so far at

25
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,470
concepts like
regeneration,

26
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,270
essentially taking, let's

27
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,549
say exhaust gases out,

28
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:53,029
using it to preheat,

29
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:54,469
compress air before

30
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,589
entering the combustor and

31
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:00,189
then into a turbine
regeneration.

32
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:02,269
Last time we
looked at reheat.

33
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:03,829
Essentially, after you do

34
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,550
one pass through
a turbine,

35
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,029
reheat that low pressure,

36
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:09,269
relatively lower
pressure vapor

37
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,870
to pass through a
second turbine.

38
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,149
The idea there was that we

39
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:14,319
extended the Qin, right?

40
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,799
So we were
transferring most of

41
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,680
the heat in then at
a high temperature,

42
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
that was the
strategy of reheat.

43
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,399
The other way
that you can do

44
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,679
it is to do what's

45
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,880
called creating a top
and a bottom cycle.

46
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,999
So here, what
you would have

47
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:29,119
in this concept is that

48
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,959
you would take a
Brighton cycle, right?

49
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,689
And instead of
taking that heat,

50
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,059
and putting it
into a regenerator

51
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,659
prior to the
combustor to heat it,

52
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,579
what you do is you

53
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,539
actually take
all of that heat

54
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,019
out and you transfer it

55
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,259
into a rankin
cycle, right?

56
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,939
Maybe the most
common one I know of

57
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,859
is called organic
rankin, right?

58
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,539
And it's organic because

59
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,099
it doesn't run
on water, right?

60
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,219
So use things that
boil at, let's say,

61
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,499
lower temperatures
there and you,

62
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,479
um and you run it.

63
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,719
And by doing these top and

64
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,319
these bottom cycles here,

65
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,240
you can really boost
the efficiency.

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,760
So I pulled this number
from the textbook.

67
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,239
I mean, above 60% is like,

68
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,800
I mean, that's really
something substantial.

69
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,279
If you take the
temperatures

70
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,040
and stuff into
here and said,

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,359
what would it be
if it was Carn?

72
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:18,040
Carn was about, you
know, 80% there.

73
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
So, I mean, 62 to 80.

74
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,220
That's a pretty,
uh, um, you know,

75
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,060
for a real
efficiency, that's

76
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,860
quite an impressive
number, okay?

77
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,340
So we'll focus on this.

78
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,980
So we'll go through
and analyze this one,

79
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,700
and I'll take you through
the process of it.

80
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,620
The only really the
thing here that is

81
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,659
conceptually new is that

82
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:38,860
we need to do a
matching, right?

83
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,419
So, essentially,
we've analyzed

84
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:45,029
the Brayden cycle
as applied to um,

85
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:47,070
power generation,
you've analyzed

86
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,710
the Rankin cycle
there where

87
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,030
the heat in was
essentially into a boiler.

88
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,269
And so what you need
to remember is that

89
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,830
both of these cycles

90
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,309
run on their own
mass flow rates.

91
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,469
There's going
to be some MDOT

92
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,790
of air that circulates
through there.

93
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,069
There's going
to be an MDOT

94
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,510
of water that circulates
through here.

95
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,230
And so you have to
have matching, okay?

96
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,470
And so what does
that matching

97
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,100
look like? All right.

98
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,099
So let me see here.

99
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,580
Am I visible on my video?

100
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,940
No, I am. All right.

101
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,020
Before we get
into the weeds,

102
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,460
I'll just say that
it's at a high level.

103
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,900
All right.

104
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,539
So here's your
heat exchanger,

105
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,180
as it would be
in Brighton.

106
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,460
So this is like state
eight. All right.

107
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,389
Um, This is then how
would it look like?

108
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,870
Yeah, it would
be open, right?

109
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,270
This is then
out state nine.

110
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,990
And then for the water,

111
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,310
which you would
have because

112
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,390
this is a closed loop.

113
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,470
So your heat exchanger

114
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,590
probably look like that.

115
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,790
And then that would
be exiting in.

116
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,830
So this would
be your state I

117
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,070
should say nine. I
should say nine.

118
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,510
This should say eight,
this should say two,

119
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,310
and then this should
stay three, all right?

120
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,910
And so this
heat exchanger,

121
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,350
if I draw the control
volume on the outside

122
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:08,320
of it, All right.

123
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,040
If I draw the
control volume,

124
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,800
let's say on the
entire device here.

125
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,599
It's adiabatic, right?
There is no heat in,

126
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:18,560
and there is no heat

127
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
out of the heat exchanger.

128
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,999
It's kind of like that

129
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:22,839
doesn't make any, you
know, sense, okay?

130
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,079
But

131
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,920
all the heat exchange
happened internally.

132
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,079
So the control volume

133
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,999
with respect to
the outside,

134
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,639
there's no heat in or out.

135
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,879
There's no work, right?

136
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,999
There's no work in or
out there, all right?

137
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,520
And so what are
the ways that

138
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
energy is carried
in and out of this?

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,680
It's an enthalpy, right?

140
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,119
So if I write my,

141
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:45,539
um, conservation of
energy equation here.

142
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,899
What I'll have is, and

143
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:50,379
let's say that I
have an M dot here.

144
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,980
So the mass flow rate

145
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,779
entering through this,
what do they call it?

146
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:56,379
I think I called it dot T,

147
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,659
indicating that
that's the top cycle.

148
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,339
And then here on this,

149
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,139
I have an M dot B,

150
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:03,940
which I think I was

151
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,779
calling the
bottoming cycle,

152
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,019
right? And this
is heat exchange.

153
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,099
It's not a mixing chamber.

154
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,500
You're not mixing
air and water.

155
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,580
The purpose of this is
just to transfer heat.

156
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,979
So if I say that I

157
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,299
have a steady flow
device here, right?

158
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:19,579
So DE, CV, dt for this
red one right as my E

159
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:22,399
dot N. Minus my E

160
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,680
dot out and steady flow,
so that goes away.

161
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,159
Neglect changes in kinetic

162
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,640
and potential energy.

163
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,239
No work in or out,

164
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,599
no heat in or out of it.

165
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,400
And so what you'll

166
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,119
have is you
have to look at

167
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,719
the fluid streams that
are entering here.

168
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,079
I'm going to
have an M dot T

169
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,119
at enthalpy eight
that's entering.

170
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,479
What else do I
have entering?

171
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,919
I have plus M dot B,

172
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,499
here times enthal
P at state two,

173
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,620
and this must be equal
to what's exiting.

174
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,979
So then I can go
dot T times H nine,

175
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:00,899
and then that'll be
minus or plus dot,

176
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,739
bottom, and where is that?

177
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,220
Exiting? That's exiting at

178
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,509
H three, all right?

179
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,079
And so if we divide
because what do I need?

180
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,199
I'm looking here
in this problem,

181
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,560
which I'm not going
to read to you.

182
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,239
But essentially in part A,

183
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,159
we're looking at getting

184
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,720
the ratio of the
mass flow rate

185
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,639
between the steam and
the combustion gases.

186
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,439
So the steam is
going to be M dot B,

187
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,919
and the combustion
gases is M dot T.

188
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,999
So if I divide
both sides by

189
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:37,109
M dot T, All right.

190
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,549
And I rearrange.

191
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:41,029
So what's going to
go away, right?

192
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:45,309
This is going to
sack and sack.

193
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:48,469
And so what I'll have
here is I can write

194
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:55,849
M dot B divided by M
dot T. Times H two.

195
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,449
I have the same
thing on this side,

196
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,889
so maybe minus H three,

197
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,729
and that'll be
equal to my H

198
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:07,969
nine minus H eight.

199
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,209
What this implies
then is that

200
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:15,729
dot B divided by M
dot T is equal to

201
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,450
H nine minus H
eight divided by

202
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,609
H two minus H three. Good.

203
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,129
And this is an
important relation

204
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:28,769
because we're going to

205
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:29,809
get to refrigeration next,

206
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:30,850
and in refrigeration,

207
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,209
this is a common
approach to run

208
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,489
an upper and a lower or a

209
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:35,249
topping and a
bottoming cycle.

210
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,810
They are also to
boost efficiency.

211
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,169
So remembering that
you have to have

212
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,809
a matching criterion here,

213
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:45,769
that's important, okay?

214
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,209
Of course, what
does this mean?

215
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,929
What does this mean? So
I wrote all of this.

216
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:53,210
What does this mean?
Like in simple terms.

217
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,449
If I ask this side of

218
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,569
the room in layperson
terms to tell

219
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:01,209
me what is the meaning
of this formula here.

220
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,610
Shall I start at
the back, LS.

221
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,489
How much of what is going

222
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:19,889
out and how much of
what is going in?

223
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,689
What do I care about? Yes.

224
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,530
But I'm thinking
about the power,

225
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,130
the efficiency of
a power plant,

226
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,169
what are things
that I care about?

227
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,219
I enthalpy.

228
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,700
Let's start
simpler, right?

229
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,499
I said, this is a
big number, right?

230
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,099
And France said they
have a big number.

231
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,499
So what goes into
the efficiency

232
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:47,500
of a thermal power plant?

233
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,900
Like, what is the
definition of

234
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,660
the efficiency of
a thermal engine?

235
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,539
All right. So the
thermal efficiency

236
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,620
of an engine is your

237
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,580
w.net divided by
your q.in, right?

238
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,980
This is what we
care about, okay?

239
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,859
And what I'm saying
here, right is I

240
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:07,100
took this rank
in cycle where

241
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,620
I had aq.in that was from

242
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,900
the boiler and
I just stacked

243
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,300
it onto the Braden, okay?

244
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,060
So having said that again,

245
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,460
what do you think
is the meaning

246
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,179
of this analysis?

247
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:36,340
Now I'm opening it up
to the floor. Sure.

248
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,059
This would help us
to understand some

249
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:42,260
inefficiencies
that are there,

250
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,139
I'll give you
that. But simpler.

251
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,740
Yes, we're talking
about the waste heat.

252
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,219
Exactly.

253
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,940
So we're saying the right
word now heat here.

254
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,529
So that's an enthalpy,

255
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,250
but I want to stay
with heat, okay?

256
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,530
So this heat exchanger

257
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,769
that I'm
approximating here,

258
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:08,449
when I ran that as

259
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,490
a Braden cycle,
what was that?

260
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,450
So state seven
to 88 to nine

261
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,729
there in a Braden cycle,

262
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:18,210
what was this? Cody?

263
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,049
Condenser.

264
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:20,610
Kind of like a
condenser. Let's say

265
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,929
a low temperature
heat exchanger,

266
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:22,690
because in the Braden

267
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,929
it's a working fluids a,

268
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:25,050
so I'm not going
to condense it,

269
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,290
but let's say the
temperature heat exchanger.

270
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,610
Now, I've connected it to

271
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,169
here on the rankin cycle.

272
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,650
What was this heat
exchanger here,

273
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,689
Cody on the rakincycle

274
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:35,129
between the pump
and the turbine?

275
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:36,930
What do we call
that when it was

276
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,850
a rank in a water, a
steam power plant?

277
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,050
Boiler. Okay. So
I'm saying that

278
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,730
the low grade heat out

279
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,969
of right out of

280
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,770
the cold condenser
my Brayton,

281
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,930
is the high
temperature heat

282
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,330
that goes in, okay?

283
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,890
So if I want to say this
in a different way,

284
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,690
how would I say that,

285
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,050
having said all
of these words

286
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,120
The heat out of

287
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
the top cycle is equal to

288
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,440
the heat in of
the bottom cycle.

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
That's what's
important, okay?

290
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
It's not that
hard. This is

291
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
actually not rocket
science, right?

292
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,360
So, like, that's it.

293
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
So in writing this,
that's all I've done.

294
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,319
But the key thing you
have to remember,

295
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:25,400
and I swear I don't want

296
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,599
to grade a
single exam that

297
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,720
does this is you're going

298
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,999
to have different M dots.

299
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:30,280
These are not
mixing, right?

300
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,800
These are in separate
loops, all right?

301
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,359
Clear? Other
questions about

302
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,999
this before I
continue now with

303
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,480
this slog that is a

304
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,679
combined gas vapor
power cycle.

305
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,000
All right.

306
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,320
All right. So
that's really

307
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,800
the only new thing
that we've seen.

308
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,319
Maybe I guess I

309
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:54,200
guess I wrote it
there, right?

310
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,640
So the theral
efficiency is the

311
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,600
w.net I should write
out there, right?

312
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,760
So that's aw.net
out, right?

313
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,160
So if we solve
for this, right,

314
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,640
that's going to help
us to get to part B,

315
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,880
and we have to get
that to get to part A.

316
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,920
All right. So if we
pick up, though,

317
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,320
from our w.net, all?

318
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,279
So that's the first piece.

319
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,280
The second piece
to keep in mind

320
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,960
here is that when

321
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,040
we write this
thermal efficiency,

322
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,640
the thermal efficiency,
I said was the

323
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,799
w.net out,
divided by q.in.

324
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,600
We said before
that how else can

325
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,200
I write this w.net out

326
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,119
for a cycle is equal
to what? Q.in.

327
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:53,680
We can write
this as q.net in

328
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,340
q.net in divided
by q.in, right?

329
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,180
Now, the thing to pay
attention to here.

330
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,980
So what you're going

331
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,260
to want to do in
this problem,

332
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,860
you know, if you went

333
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,540
this route, you will
be fine, right?

334
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,500
If you went this route,
you'd be fine. Why?

335
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,180
Because net out is nothing

336
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,100
but your W dot out from,

337
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,660
let's say the
gas turbine plus

338
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,900
the W dot out from

339
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,299
the let's say the
steam turbine,

340
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,020
and then that's going
to be minus the

341
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,770
w.in for

342
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,530
the compressor
and plus the

343
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,130
w.in for the pump, okay?

344
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,449
And then that's all
going to be divided by

345
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:41,890
q.in, right? That's fine.

346
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,610
So we'll do this,
and we'll get into

347
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,010
analyzing each of those
steady flow devices.

348
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,490
If you decided
in this problem

349
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,690
to go with the net Q in,

350
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,089
this is going to
be problematic

351
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:52,370
in this problem,
all right?

352
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,500
Um, and why is that?

353
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,780
I have air coming
into my compressor.

354
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,260
I have some work in here.

355
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,580
I have the
combustor, I have

356
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,020
a cubed out in
that looks great.

357
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,659
Seven to eight gas tb,

358
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:06,940
I have some amount
of work out.

359
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,340
Eight to nine and
I have a heat

360
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,990
exchanger, and it's good.

361
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,240
The point though, is
that in this problem,

362
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,080
the exhaust gases leave

363
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,559
at state nine here at 450.

364
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,400
Do we think that
450 Kelvin is going

365
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,480
to be the same temperature

366
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,040
as when I draw air
in from the outside?

367
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,240
Yes or no? No, okay?

368
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
So if you want to
go that route,

369
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,600
what you need to do is
you'd have to model,

370
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,560
essentially another
heat exchanger,

371
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,400
to say, okay, now I
took all of that out.

372
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,719
If you didn't do
that and you just

373
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,560
plugged and chugged
and, Hey, look,

374
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,439
I have this as my
heat in, workout,

375
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:38,760
workout, heat out, you're

376
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,200
going to be wrong
in this problem.

377
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,240
It's because this
above as it's

378
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,600
drawn and presented is

379
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,120
actually not a
complete cycle.

380
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,720
State five is
not state nine,

381
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,610
okay? All right.

382
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,289
And now we're starting

383
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:53,210
to get like real, right?

384
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,090
Like, now I'm not
idealizing as much.

385
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,730
I'm starting to give
you real conditions.

386
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,410
Again, this is
another way in

387
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,810
which if you again,

388
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,489
go with these analysis
and with this,

389
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:04,370
this is not going
to be a way

390
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,930
to go with how
it's presented.

391
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,970
You'd have to
add another one.

392
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,420
Is there a question?

393
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,550
No. Okay.

394
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,510
Okay, good.

395
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,430
So if we come here
and we think about

396
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,510
then how we define
each of these terms,

397
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,710
what we'll have
to do, right,

398
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,749
is to draw control volumes

399
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:21,870
around each of
these devices.

400
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,710
These are steady
flow devices.

401
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,790
For each of these, we
neglect changes in

402
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,870
kinetic and potential
energy. All right?

403
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,630
So if we think about now,

404
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,709
let me see if I have
a different marker.

405
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:39,950
Okay. That's better.

406
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,110
Okay. All right.

407
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,470
All right.

408
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,029
So if we go bit by
bit through this,

409
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:50,710
so the W dot out

410
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,390
for your compressor
or I'm sorry,

411
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,830
your W dot out
for your gas

412
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,590
turbine is there is going

413
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,270
to be the dot T of there

414
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,029
and that's going
to be the enthalpy

415
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,510
at state seven H

416
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,230
seven minus H
eight actual?

417
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,910
And the reason
why that I write

418
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,150
H eight actual is
because in this problem,

419
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,830
you were told that there's

420
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,550
isotropic efficiencies

421
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,069
for the compressor
and the turbine.

422
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:23,750
So just to remind you,

423
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,909
when it comes
to the turbine,

424
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:27,630
the isentropic
efficiency of

425
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,150
a turbine is the ratio
of the actual work out

426
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,550
of it divided by

427
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,550
the isentropic
work out of it.

428
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,990
So it means that
the initial state

429
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,030
here is always a seven
divided by a seven,

430
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,149
in the bottom that's
the isentropic,

431
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,670
so that's h8s,
and then this

432
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,745
is minus H eight
actual, okay?

433
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,260
Since this is a
given, great.

434
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,300
H seven,

435
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,820
we're going to be able
to determine, right.

436
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,339
A lot of times
in these cycles,

437
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,540
what's given generally is

438
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,660
the hottest temperature

439
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,659
and the highest pressure.

440
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:00,900
You generally will
know the inlet state

441
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,180
right into your work
transfer device,

442
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,300
in this case, the turbine.

443
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,859
So you'll know that.

444
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,219
You'll be able to get to

445
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:10,739
h8s because

446
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,139
the downstream pressure is

447
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:13,059
probably also going to be,

448
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,969
um uh, given, especially
in this case,

449
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,929
it's going to be
essentially the atmosphere.

450
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:19,929
So isotropic and
you know that.

451
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:21,529
H seven, again, you know,

452
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:24,209
and then you solve
for HA, right?

453
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,729
So HA is going

454
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:30,289
to be equal to E,
so the negative,

455
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:37,449
that is E to T H seven
minus h8s, right?

456
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:40,729
That's then minus H seven.

457
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,209
If we make that a
positive, we make

458
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,849
this a negative, make
that a positive.

459
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,690
That's how you'll
determine that enthalpy,

460
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:46,889
right?

461
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:48,969
So that's the workout of

462
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,690
out of the gas
turbine, right?

463
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,439
The work out of

464
00:17:56,439 --> 00:18:00,239
the steam turbine is

465
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,479
then going to be
your mass floor

466
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,720
to your bottoming
cycle again,

467
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,560
steady flow
device, neglect

468
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,280
changes in kinetic
and potential energy.

469
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,639
And so here, what
you're going to have

470
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:10,079
is H three minus,

471
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,919
again, H four A,

472
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,599
with the actual, except
that in this case,

473
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:20,119
you're told that
the efficiency

474
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,119
of the steam turbine
is 100%, okay?

475
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,164
What's the
language for this?

476
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:27,289
The bottom mean cycle is

477
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,009
an ideal, an ideal, right?

478
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,849
This is an ideal
ranking cycle,

479
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,649
which means that it's
going to operate

480
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,729
isentropically. What
does this mean?

481
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:37,889
It means that
your H four A

482
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:42,009
is going to be equal
to your h4s, okay?

483
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,309
Good. For the work in,

484
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:49,150
so if we have our w.in

485
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,590
for our well, let's
be consistent.

486
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,829
We call this like gas.

487
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:58,030
So this is w.in for
the gas turbine.

488
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,829
Again, that's going
to be the M dot T

489
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:02,630
because it's
the top cycle.

490
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,629
And here, it's
going to be a six,

491
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:10,274
actual minus H five.

492
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,039
You recall the
isentropic efficiency

493
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,559
as it's given for a
compressor, right?

494
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,999
So it's the
minimum work in

495
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,399
divided by the
actual work in.

496
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,759
The minimum work in is
when it's isotropic.

497
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,119
So here, that
would then be

498
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:27,279
the minimum work would
be H six minus H five,

499
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,839
and the actual
one is H six A

500
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,759
minus H five, okay?

501
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,799
You can solve for
this. So then

502
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,759
your actual would be what?

503
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:43,599
It would be equal to
H six minus H five.

504
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,399
That's a bad 55.

505
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:49,139
So swap this E to C,

506
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:51,479
goes below, which
is a given.

507
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:56,499
Then, um, plus H five.

508
00:19:56,499 --> 00:20:00,299
And then this is H six A.

509
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,019
So you have H six A.

510
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:06,139
Here, your actual enthalpy

511
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,899
for something like
a compressor,

512
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:09,340
would be given,
we'll analyze

513
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,420
this when we get
to properties,

514
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,299
but the inlet
state is given.

515
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,020
Generally, with
compressors,

516
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,620
you given what's

517
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,700
called the
compression ratio.

518
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,899
So the ratio of

519
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,860
the outlet pressure
to the inlet.

520
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,859
So by knowing the state
one, by knowing that,

521
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,100
and now by knowing

522
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,819
the enthalpy
specific enthalpy,

523
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,099
you're going to know also

524
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,740
that state at six
if you cared.

525
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,539
And then w.in When

526
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:34,740
it comes to
call this pump,

527
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,419
maybe just to
be consistent,

528
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,180
I can call this
ST for the steam,

529
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,419
w.ns that's the bottom
cycle, which is there.

530
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:50,380
Your pump here is
going to be HSA,

531
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,459
I'm sorry, HA minus H one.

532
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:55,779
Again, because the problem

533
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:56,940
here is telling
you that it's

534
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,259
an ideal ranking cycle

535
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:58,939
with no other information

536
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:00,059
about isotropic

537
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,739
efficiencies or
anything like that.

538
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:03,339
What this means is that

539
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,139
the isentropic
efficiency of

540
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,359
your pump it's going
to be equal to one,

541
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,319
which means that H two
A is equal to H twos.

542
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,879
How do you determine
that state?

543
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,879
You determine
this state here

544
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:20,279
because you would
assume that

545
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,600
this device operates

546
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,160
isentropically and you're

547
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,599
generally given

548
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,280
the high temperature
pressure of this cycle.

549
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,839
You know the
specific entropy,

550
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,039
you know the
pressure, you then

551
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,639
know the state.

552
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:35,519
You can determine
H two A from that.

553
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,799
The final one is your

554
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,359
Q dot N. Your
q.in All right.

555
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,879
This is occurring your

556
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,480
q.in is happening in
the combustion chamber,

557
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,880
so that's going to
be your M dot times

558
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,800
the top cycle,

559
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,240
and this is going to
be the specific enthal

560
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,639
pH seven, okay?

561
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:00,519
And then minus, pay
attention to this.

562
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,919
This will then
be six A, right?

563
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,199
So the actual state
there, right.

564
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,330
So now we put that
all together.

565
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,369
So what we'll have, what's

566
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,689
easier for me to write?

567
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:21,209
Maybe I can try to
fit it with this.

568
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:25,409
So the actual efficiency

569
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:28,969
then is let's
write it out.

570
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:31,129
So we have our out, right?

571
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,809
So we have dot

572
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,130
T. Let's start with
the gas turbine,

573
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:41,170
H seven minus HA

574
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,969
plus the bottom

575
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:45,209
cycles contribution
to the out,

576
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:52,130
which will be H
three minus H fours.

577
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,129
Okay? That's great.

578
00:22:56,129 --> 00:23:00,289
And then minus
the network out.

579
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:02,369
So for our network out,

580
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:08,889
what we will have is
an M dot top here.

581
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:13,649
So in, I'm sorry,
for the in.

582
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:15,569
So the w.in, we can
start with that.

583
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:20,369
The top one is H
six A minus H five,

584
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:26,250
and that's plus an M
dot of our bottom,

585
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,130
which is then steam,

586
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:36,379
which will be All right.

587
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:37,979
So the bottom is there,

588
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:42,339
that's H two A
minus r one.

589
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:47,260
Great. Then all of that
is divided by our Qn,

590
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:54,219
which is the dot T times
H seven minus six A.

591
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,939
And so what we'll
see out of this is

592
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,419
that actually for a
problem like this,

593
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:05,379
I need not give you a
mass flow rate in order

594
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:08,619
to actually get in

595
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,420
order to actually get
to the efficiency

596
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,619
because all of
this is just going

597
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:15,820
to be ratios of the
dots, all right?

598
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,099
All right. So if we

599
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,779
take this and we put
this here, right,

600
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:29,379
M dot T dot T dot T,

601
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:32,419
and then dot T, right?

602
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:34,180
This is going to be gone,

603
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,819
and then that's going
to be All right,

604
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:38,019
and that's
essentially going

605
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,180
to be gone, all right?

606
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,219
So now we'll go state
by state, all right?

607
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:43,219
So we have now from

608
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:45,060
our first
principles, right?

609
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,619
We have our formulas.

610
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,699
So this is one that's
important to us.

611
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,169
Okay. I blow this up.

612
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:56,729
This is the second one,

613
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,769
which is important to us.

614
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,489
All right. And so now we

615
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:03,769
just have to go
state by state

616
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,129
and determine this.

617
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,730
Are there any questions
at this point?

618
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,249
Yes, please, Elias.

619
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:18,679
Louder. Yeah, this would

620
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:21,520
be two because it
would be fine.

621
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,639
I said that they're equal,

622
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:26,239
but I tried to be,
so this is h2s,

623
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,720
but because the pump
rates an ideal ranking,

624
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,359
H twoA would be
H twos because

625
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,800
the isotropic efficiency

626
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,880
is one, but that's
a good catch.

627
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,400
Other questions?
No. Great.

628
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay. So let's
get the states.

629
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,199
So we start here.

630
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,320
Well, we can go a
number of ways,

631
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,520
but what's going
to be easiest?

632
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,880
Let's see how I did
it in my notes.

633
00:25:49,880 --> 00:26:00,370
Combined Great.

634
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,889
Okay.

635
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:03,050
All right.

636
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,049
So we'll write a couple

637
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:05,530
of pieces of information.

638
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:11,279
Questions? I hear
voices in my head.

639
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,159
I don't want to hear
actual voices, right?

640
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:14,080
But if you have questions,

641
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,359
please ask. All right.

642
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,479
So as this problem

643
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:19,760
is written, okay,
we're given,

644
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,599
right, this PR, right,

645
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,040
a pressure ratio,

646
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,160
which is equal to eight
for the compressor.

647
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,359
So what does this imply?

648
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:31,639
This implies for the
compressor that P six,

649
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,879
right, divided by P

650
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:37,399
five is equal
to PR, right?

651
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:38,960
And because P five is

652
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,000
essentially
atmospheric pressure,

653
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,359
you'll then know the
pressure at state six.

654
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,919
That's the first
one, okay?

655
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,279
So state one, Okay.

656
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,279
We have P one,
which is equal to

657
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:00,999
101 pa. All right.

658
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,079
And a temperature T one

659
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,480
that's equal
to 300 Kelvin.

660
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,599
Now, you're not given
this pressure here,

661
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,119
but I expect you to
infer that, okay?

662
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm taking in air.

663
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,200
Air is at a pressure.

664
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,559
This is a power plant, it

665
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,039
is not up in
the sky, okay?

666
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,199
Unless space force wants
it up there, right?

667
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,639
Otherwise, it's on the
ground, all right?

668
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,320
So you have this
as your pressure.

669
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
Give me one, and then

670
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,720
the temperature
was a given.

671
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,840
Yes, please. Question.

672
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,439
I'm sorry. This
is State five.

673
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,039
I apologize. Good catch.

674
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,439
State five is what
I meant, right?

675
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:35,679
So you have
state five here,

676
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,599
which is at
this condition.

677
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,639
This is a give me.

678
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:40,039
It means from this, you

679
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,999
would be able
to know H five

680
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:44,199
and you'd be able to

681
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:48,199
know little S
five there, okay?

682
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,439
So reason I started
one in my life, right?

683
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,079
Here we are at a
little bit different.

684
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,559
Okay, you have

685
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,279
this piece of
information, right?

686
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,679
So we have this
with the PR,

687
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,959
and essentially what that

688
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,599
means then for State six,

689
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,609
with State six let's say

690
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:07,369
state six S for the
isentropic case,

691
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:09,489
as we know that P
six is equal to

692
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:12,769
PR times P five.

693
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:15,729
And if I did the

694
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:17,609
entropy analysis
of that device,

695
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,129
it's a steady flow device,

696
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:20,929
adiabatic reversible.

697
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,329
It means that the
specific entropy at

698
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:25,409
the inlet is equal to

699
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:26,809
the specific entropy
of the outlet

700
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:28,089
for the isentropic case.

701
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:32,039
So little S six is
equal to little five.

702
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,919
What it means here is
that you will know

703
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,359
H sixS, all right?

704
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,159
Not enough
information, right?

705
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,879
You need to then
go through, use

706
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:42,279
the isotropic efficiency
for a compressor,

707
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,999
and then you can
determine H six A, okay?

708
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,479
But this is the
way, all right?

709
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,479
This is the way.

710
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:55,349
All right, um,
Good, good, good.

711
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,230
What was that efficiency

712
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,549
that we were given
in this problem?

713
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:03,429
The isotropic efficiency
of this compressor,

714
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:05,869
I think is 0.8.

715
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,589
So that's important for

716
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:12,429
the analysis to
a six A there.

717
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:14,309
I said this already that

718
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:16,430
this was atmospheric
pressure.

719
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,629
And is there any
other information

720
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:20,789
that I need to
give on this?

721
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:24,469
No, I do not.

722
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,340
All right, State seven.

723
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,659
So going along
to State seven.

724
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:35,299
So for its state seven,

725
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:38,219
you're given you're
basically given

726
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:40,940
the temperature of the air

727
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,060
as it enters into
the turbine.

728
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,739
So your T seven
is exactly that.

729
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:51,409
That's 13 Calvin,
so that's good.

730
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,249
And since this
is, you know,

731
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,010
it's a combustion chamber,

732
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,849
but until we get to

733
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:00,009
the last week of
this semester,

734
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:01,970
we're essentially
treating those things

735
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,490
as city flow
heat exchangers.

736
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,090
And so what it means is
for a heat exchanger,

737
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,249
we have no pressure
drop across it, right?

738
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:14,649
So it means that P seven
is equal to P six.

739
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,170
How do I know P six?

740
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,810
Because from knowing right

741
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,680
from state All right,

742
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,319
to get to state six A,

743
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,000
what you're going
to know is you will

744
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,239
determine H six A,

745
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:30,239
and you will know
P six, right?

746
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:32,879
So from this, you will
be able to get to

747
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:36,439
P six actual from that.

748
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:40,199
So you have this
information, and from here,

749
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,799
you'll be able to
get then H seven,

750
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,279
and you'll get a
seven from that.

751
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,679
All right, State seven.

752
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,279
We're going to
state eight, State

753
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,959
eight. State eight.

754
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:57,039
And for state eight,

755
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,599
the first step is to
get to state eight S

756
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,999
before we then
go to eight A.

757
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:04,960
All right? And again,
you need to look

758
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,040
a little bit forward.

759
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,559
So you have exhaust
gases coming out of

760
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,599
the turbine that are just

761
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,039
exhausting to
the atmosphere.

762
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,759
So what you'll
expect here is that

763
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,719
p eight will be equal to

764
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:20,394
101 pa. All right.

765
00:31:20,394 --> 00:31:22,150
Because essentially that

766
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,710
the heat exchange
isobaric,

767
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,989
State nine is
going to be at

768
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:26,310
atmospheric pressure,

769
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,549
so that's going to
be state eight.

770
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:30,590
And again, if you
did your steady

771
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,189
flow entropy
analysis of this,

772
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:35,269
you would see that S eight

773
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,949
here for this case
is going to be

774
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:38,789
equal to little S seven.

775
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:43,189
And from this, what
you'll have is h8s.

776
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:47,030
You'll remember that
the istropic efficiency

777
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,670
for this turbine
is given as 0.85.

778
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,350
So you use this
information

779
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,869
with the formula
that I gave you

780
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:58,619
before for determining,
um eight A.

781
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:00,019
And so what
you'll have an is

782
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:05,259
state eight A, right?

783
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,860
So by knowing the
isentropic efficiency,

784
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,619
by knowing the
isotropic enthalpy,

785
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:13,459
you will be able to from

786
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:22,659
our formula here to
get to H eight A,

787
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:24,219
and the pressure
doesn't change, right?

788
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:26,499
So the pressure
is still P eight.

789
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:31,620
And so from
this, you know,

790
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,939
you could determine
things like,

791
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,799
um, Let me think about
this for a second.

792
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,919
What do I actually
need at state A?

793
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,039
I don't really
need anything,

794
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:42,919
but you know it, right?

795
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,399
So basically,

796
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,719
with this, the
state's complete.

797
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,279
But what you care
about for the purposes

798
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,759
of computing
efficiency was

799
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,959
getting to eight
A there, okay?

800
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:55,999
So that's for
our Brighton.

801
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:57,600
We can then move
on to the states

802
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,159
for water, all right?

803
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,199
What's the best
thing to do here?

804
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,200
The best thing to do here

805
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,360
is just to write
on the board.

806
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,839
All right, um, So

807
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:09,159
coming along then onto
the rank in side.

808
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:12,080
So the rank inside,
what are we told here?

809
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,080
This is an ideal rank
in cycle that operates

810
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,799
between seven PA and
five kPa, right?

811
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,119
So operating between this,

812
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,319
you have to recognize

813
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,999
that generally the boiler,

814
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,200
what we call the
heat exchanger

815
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,599
here is your high
pressure side,

816
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,039
and the condenser is

817
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:26,839
low pressure side.

818
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,879
Why am I saying
that, right?

819
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,479
It's isobaric. So here

820
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,720
to here is the
same pressure,

821
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,160
here to here is
the same pressure.

822
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,120
So high pressure
and low pressure.

823
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,639
One and two, you're

824
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:39,319
given the temperature
of the steam, okay?

825
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,240
So we know the temperature
at state three.

826
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,979
So state three
state three,

827
00:33:45,979 --> 00:33:49,299
you're basically given
T three is an equal to

828
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:55,739
your 500 degrees
C. P three is

829
00:33:55,739 --> 00:34:00,900
equal to the higher
pressure of seven

830
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,019
PA seven pA. What

831
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:06,459
it means from this
is that you know

832
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:08,859
H three and you
know S three.

833
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:11,739
That's a good start.
On to state four,

834
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,829
State four, This is

835
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:16,669
an ideal ranking so
that turbines can

836
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:18,830
operate isotropically,
the steam turbine.

837
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,349
If you did

838
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,149
your entropy analysis
on that device,

839
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:23,069
you would see that
specific entropy at

840
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:25,150
the exit is equal to
that of the inlet.

841
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,869
So little S four is
equal to little S three,

842
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:30,909
and the pressure at
state four, right,

843
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,670
because it's connected
to the condenser

844
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,149
is going to be at the
low pressure, right?

845
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:35,549
So then P four here

846
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:37,709
is equal to the
low pressure,

847
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,870
which looks to me
like five kpa?

848
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,079
So five KPA there.

849
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,919
And it means from
this that you know

850
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,879
your you know
the age four.

851
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,919
I'll write H for A because

852
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:54,199
H four A is equal
to H four here.

853
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,839
You know H fourS
but that's also

854
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,519
equal to H A.

855
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,199
Okay? That's good.

856
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,894
You then move along
to state one.

857
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,870
It's crucial to recognize

858
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,750
that for a Rankin cycle,

859
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,629
one piece of
information which is

860
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:11,709
implicit from that
is the condenser.

861
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,389
It means that at X one,

862
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:14,990
you're a saturated liquid,

863
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,469
your condensed state, it's

864
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:18,949
equal to zero, right?

865
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:20,710
And because it's
a heat exchanger,

866
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,109
P one is then going to
be equal to P four,

867
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:29,029
then you know S one
and you know H one.

868
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:30,869
The final piece of
information then

869
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:35,429
is its state two.

870
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:38,789
So at state two here,

871
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:40,470
you do entropy analysis.

872
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,509
Little S two is going to

873
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:42,829
be equal to little S one.

874
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:45,149
It's an isotropic process,

875
00:35:45,149 --> 00:35:47,349
and the pressure you're
going to have here,

876
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,469
P two is the high
pressure side.

877
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:51,429
It's going to be
equal to P three.

878
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:52,709
And so what it
means is that

879
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:54,189
you have h3s here,

880
00:35:54,189 --> 00:35:57,869
which is basically equal
to or H twoS here,

881
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:01,470
which is equal to H two
A because it's ideal.

882
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,429
The isotropic efficiency
is 100%, okay?

883
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,394
Yes, please.

884
00:36:06,394 --> 00:36:13,799
If we go mark to 868
isn't the guess,

885
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:14,919
but it was one of

886
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,359
the ideas is that
you would use

887
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,359
the p68 and the
actual mental reason

888
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,400
to find P weird

889
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,239
because it's like
you use P six to use

890
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:32,175
p68 and I don't
understand how it works.

891
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:39,389
An elastic. State six,

892
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:41,229
when you go into the
compressor state,

893
00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:42,869
so at the exit of
the compressor,

894
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,909
what you're generally told

895
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:45,269
is what that pressure is.

896
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,949
You're generally
told what this is.

897
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:48,829
That's equal to the
inlet pressure,

898
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:51,189
which is P five times
the pressure ratio PR.

899
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:52,629
The second step into

900
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,069
getting to the
actual enthalpy

901
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:55,430
is you assume it operates

902
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,869
isotropically first,

903
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:00,149
adiabatic and reversible,
you get H six.

904
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:02,789
To get to H six A,

905
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:07,709
I need to know H six
and I need to know ESC,

906
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:10,509
the isentropic
compressor efficiency.

907
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:13,109
With that, Here, I

908
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:15,869
can get to H six A
through this, right?

909
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,070
Because I have h6s.

910
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,629
I determine H five I
knew E to C was given.

911
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:20,949
Now I have H six A.

912
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:22,469
And I got to this
state, and I said,

913
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:23,429
What the hell can I tell

914
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:24,470
you with this exercise?

915
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,229
And I thought, Well,

916
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:26,990
maybe pressure
is interesting.

917
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,909
But yeah,

918
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:32,469
so that's essentially
that's what I have.

919
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:33,749
And then if you
continue, right,

920
00:37:33,749 --> 00:37:38,669
you go to that's
about six.

921
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:40,069
You'd go to state
seven, right?

922
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:42,389
P seven is equal
to P six A,

923
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:45,109
which is then
where I used that,

924
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:46,069
I suppose, and then with

925
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:47,349
the temperature,
I have that.

926
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,174
But what's
recursive about it?

927
00:37:49,174 --> 00:37:54,479
So just to clarify, P
value possibilities.

928
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,399
Oh, I see what
you mean here.

929
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,879
Yeah, no, no, it's not.

930
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,959
Yeah. That would
just be P six.

931
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,839
So at this day, you
have the information.

932
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,159
Of course, you
could know what

933
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,319
the actual entropy is,

934
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:05,279
but we don't need

935
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,839
actually anything
more at this point

936
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:09,559
to continue on in our
analysis because again,

937
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,559
at State seven, we

938
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,359
already know that
information at State seven.

939
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,680
Yeah, that's a good catch.

940
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,519
Thank you for that.

941
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,629
Okay. I wanted to

942
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,029
say something. That's
a dangerous thing.

943
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,589
You know what Mark
Twain said, right?

944
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,149
No.

945
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:21,829
No.

946
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:24,509
A famous Midwestern,
you know, philosopher.

947
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:27,509
So better to
remain quiet and

948
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:29,029
thought a fool
than speak and

949
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:30,709
remove all doubt, okay?

950
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,670
And if you go to
the Doe library

951
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,149
right here at the
library here,

952
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:35,669
they have a ton of his
collections, okay?

953
00:38:35,669 --> 00:38:36,789
He was an amazing writer.

954
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:38,349
Alright. Other
questions about this

955
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,890
so far or Mark Twain?

956
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,670
Short letters,
long letters.

957
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,710
I have a lot of quotes.

958
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,349
Okay. Anyway, so now
that we know, right,

959
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:46,269
so now we basically know

960
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:48,790
the enthalpies at
all of these states,

961
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,589
the first step would be to

962
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,830
compute this ratio.

963
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,669
I guess the final thing I

964
00:38:53,669 --> 00:38:54,869
haven't told you
is state nine.

965
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:55,669
Let's do that.

966
00:38:55,669 --> 00:39:01,339
So state nine state
nine here, right?

967
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,179
So that pressure at
state nine is going

968
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,019
to be equal to the
atmospheric pressure.

969
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:06,619
So the p eight there,

970
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,500
I'll just write it
one oh one kPa.

971
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,219
You're exhausting
to the atmosphere,

972
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,579
and you're also
given it, right?

973
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:18,819
You were given 450 Kelvin
was the exit state.

974
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:22,459
And from this, you
know H nine, right?

975
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:30,779
So I know H eight
actual there.

976
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:34,079
I have H two,

977
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,479
which we call H two
actual if we wanted to,

978
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:39,319
and then minus
our H three.

979
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:41,840
With this, you know
that ratio of the mass

980
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,640
for rates in the
bottom cycle

981
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,720
in the top cycle.

982
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,959
H seven, we had there

983
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,439
HA H three was

984
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:52,480
given in the problem
essentially minus h4s.

985
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,879
That could also
be H four A it

986
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,360
operates isentropically.

987
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,439
H six A,

988
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,200
we knew from the
pressure ratio

989
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,119
and the isentropic
efficiency,

990
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,200
H five was given h2s,

991
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,599
that could also be
H two A because

992
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,039
the isotropic efficiency

993
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,120
of this pump is 100%,

994
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,320
and H one was a given.

995
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,279
H seven. Let's
look at this.

996
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:15,519
H seven was also a

997
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,720
given because
the temperature

998
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,879
and the pressure there,

999
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:19,439
and then H six A we have.

1000
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:21,799
So you would go in with
all of that and you

1001
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:23,079
would have this and

1002
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,599
you'd have this
formula, okay?

1003
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,519
It's kind of a
slog to do it.

1004
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,399
As you can imagine,
this is not probably

1005
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:30,639
an appropriate
question to ask in

1006
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,249
a quiz unless I ask one
question, all right?

1007
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:35,419
So, um, but what

1008
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:36,699
you'll see in a
problem like this

1009
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:38,099
is it still just
has you practice

1010
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,339
your fundamentals
through this, right?

1011
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:41,740
So steady flow analysis,

1012
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,860
write your
energy equation,

1013
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,339
go bit by bit, write
your formulas out.

1014
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,740
For that, recognize
if it's ideal,

1015
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,300
right, if it's ideal

1016
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,459
or if an isentropic
efficiency is given.

1017
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:54,579
If an isentropic
efficiency is given,

1018
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:55,619
you should
automatically be

1019
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,459
thinking about how to get

1020
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,699
the actual states
using, right,

1021
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:00,980
the inlets and
the isotropic,

1022
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,080
um, um, you know,
enthalpies.

1023
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,679
And then the final
part of this one

1024
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,159
that was kind of a
little bit, you know,

1025
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,999
tricky was that it was the

1026
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,479
w.net out divided by q.in,

1027
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,999
was the correct
route to go.

1028
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:14,639
The reason being
that this was not

1029
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,600
actually a closed
loop cycle.

1030
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,999
State five and nine
were different.

1031
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,239
If you wanted to
connect them,

1032
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,840
you totally could,
and therefore,

1033
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,880
you could use
this approach,

1034
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,519
but you'd have to
have essentially

1035
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,800
a fictitious
heat exchanger

1036
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,839
that you would draw

1037
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,919
here to get that do
that extra Q dot out

1038
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,399
turn step to get

1039
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:33,584
you back to state
five, okay?

1040
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:36,009
And again, the whole
reason why you would do

1041
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:37,810
this a top and
bottom cycle

1042
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:38,969
is because you
want to eke out.

1043
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:40,649
You don't just want
to waste, right,

1044
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:42,889
that heat and exhaust
into the atmosphere.

1045
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:46,490
Regenerators do okay,
but with this approach,

1046
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,009
according to the
book, you'll get

1047
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,010
to a better performance

1048
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,449
by combining them, okay?

1049
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:53,929
And again, just
to remind you,

1050
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,369
that's a big number, okay?

1051
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:57,369
62% is a large number

1052
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:59,249
for a power
plant, all right?

1053
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:01,649
Questions? Yes, please.

1054
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:06,099
So the pressure ratio
it's only State five.

1055
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:08,300
Yeah, so pressure ratios

1056
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,339
is six to five, right?

1057
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:11,739
So PR, I've used it here.

1058
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,460
So when I say a
pressure ratio,

1059
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,659
the topping cycle is

1060
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:15,939
a gas turbine cycle that

1061
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:17,739
has a pressure
ratio of eight.

1062
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:20,499
This means that the
pressure at state

1063
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,139
six is equal to

1064
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,299
eight times the pressure

1065
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:24,379
at state five, right?

1066
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:26,099
This applies to
the compressor.

1067
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,899
Because, you know,

1068
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:30,099
here we have essentially

1069
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:31,899
a heat exchanger and
a heat exchanger,

1070
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:33,739
it also means that
you know the pressure

1071
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:36,539
at state seven, right?

1072
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:38,179
Because essentially that's

1073
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:39,260
an isoberic device.

1074
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,700
But when we did
this analysis,

1075
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,939
a pressure ratio that was

1076
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:44,359
specific to the
compressor, right?

1077
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:47,379
Is that clear?
Other questions?

1078
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:49,419
Questions on this side?

1079
00:42:49,419 --> 00:42:52,059
No? Okay, cool.

1080
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:53,379
So this is what it
would look like,

1081
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:54,179
the two different ones.

1082
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,379
So this is what
you're ranking,

1083
00:42:55,379 --> 00:42:57,419
the bottoming cycle
would look like NTS.

1084
00:42:57,419 --> 00:42:59,019
This is what the
topping cycle

1085
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:00,619
would look like
for the Brayton.

1086
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,579
Of course, if I want
heat exchange to happen,

1087
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,339
I'd have to look
at 9-8 A, right?

1088
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:09,139
So nine tops out
at about 400

1089
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:11,289
or so, AA at 800.

1090
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,119
And then this is
your heat in, right,

1091
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,879
from 300 up to like
750 there, right?

1092
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:18,039
So because we haven't
done 109 yet,

1093
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,399
but if you want heat
exchange to happen,

1094
00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:21,119
as we recognized from
earlier in this course,

1095
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,439
you must maintain
Delta Ts, right?

1096
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:24,799
So it makes sense, right,

1097
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,360
that this
temperature is less

1098
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,280
than the inlets
and vice versa,

1099
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,519
but they can't be too
out of whack, right?

1100
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:32,759
And this problem was
basically given to you,

1101
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:33,599
but that would be

1102
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,919
another consideration
is that

1103
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:36,440
ideally you
would perfectly

1104
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,879
match your
temperatures there,

1105
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:40,039
minimizing irreversibilities
and all of that,

1106
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,199
okay?

1107
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,919
And I tried to

1108
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:44,079
draw both these
things on here.

1109
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,039
I've done it for
other ones, but yeah,

1110
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:48,439
Pike Are said, No,
not to me today.

1111
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:50,999
Okay. So the final way,

1112
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:54,640
so I'll just I'll say
this one with words.

1113
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,959
And if I'm not

1114
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:56,599
going to have time to

1115
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:57,359
go through the
whole thing.

1116
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,800
If that one was a slog,

1117
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,999
this one is like I mean,

1118
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:02,439
it's, but you
can't follow it.

1119
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,079
It is a very

1120
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:03,999
interesting it

1121
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:05,159
is quite an
interesting system,

1122
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:06,199
but I'll explain to

1123
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:08,039
you what we're doing here.

1124
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,840
So a lot of times,

1125
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,359
so I'll have let's say
I have a gas turbine

1126
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:16,439
and I'll have waste heat

1127
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:19,079
or whatever that's
coming out of it.

1128
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,159
Previously,

1129
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,639
in the previous
example, we took that,

1130
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,599
we ran a steam turbine,

1131
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,269
and we got some
efficiencies.

1132
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:27,259
Most of the energy used in

1133
00:44:27,259 --> 00:44:29,219
this world is
not electricity,

1134
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:30,579
though, is heat, right?

1135
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:31,739
So a majority of

1136
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:33,579
the energy is used in
some form of heat.

1137
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:35,419
And engineering, we
call this a lot of

1138
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:37,899
times as process
heat process heat.

1139
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:39,059
You want to think
about how you do

1140
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:41,659
refining of something,
think of aluminum.

1141
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:42,899
You know, you think

1142
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:44,419
of any materials
production,

1143
00:44:44,419 --> 00:44:46,539
there's a lot
of process heat

1144
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:49,699
involved in those
industries, right? A lot.

1145
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:52,419
So it may make sense then,

1146
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:53,979
depending on
where you are and

1147
00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:55,499
where you have
a gas turbine,

1148
00:44:55,499 --> 00:44:56,819
to take the heat off of

1149
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,019
that and actually
use it just to heat.

1150
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:02,059
I think down in San Diego
and on campus here,

1151
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:03,780
I forget the situation
here on campus,

1152
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,554
we're kind of in a, um,

1153
00:45:05,554 --> 00:45:07,130
in a state of transition.

1154
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,209
But for example, when
I was in Chicago,

1155
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,169
we had a lot of hospitals
that were there.

1156
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:12,289
And so what they
would do is we

1157
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:13,490
had a cogen facility.

1158
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,769
So this is in energy
speak, is called CoGen.

1159
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:18,250
So the CoGen facility

1160
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,489
we had there produced
our own power,

1161
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:20,889
natural gas turbine, and

1162
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:21,889
the waste heat was used

1163
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:22,929
to produce steam, right?

1164
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,490
So we basically
district heating.

1165
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,249
Hospitals need a lot
of steam, right?

1166
00:45:26,249 --> 00:45:27,649
They sterilized
stuff, right?

1167
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:29,689
There's a lot of heat

1168
00:45:29,689 --> 00:45:31,929
that's needed for that,
but also buildings.

1169
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,409
It's a cold place, right?

1170
00:45:33,409 --> 00:45:35,289
And so you could use you
basically would have

1171
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:37,689
sort of this
underground steam

1172
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:39,489
that was used there.

1173
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:40,929
And so you can go into and

1174
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:42,825
do those analysis, um,

1175
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:44,319
And you can also
come up with

1176
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,119
a measure of efficiency.

1177
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,319
So I can write it,
let's say, maybe here.

1178
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,119
And so the one difference.

1179
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,399
So if you think
about, you know,

1180
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:55,159
our definition
of efficiency,

1181
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,079
something that I
desire divided by

1182
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,719
something I have
to pay for, right?

1183
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:02,119
So for a system
like this with

1184
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:04,439
that sort of measure
of efficiency,

1185
00:46:04,439 --> 00:46:05,999
what they'll write
is Epsilon, right?

1186
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:07,999
Epsilon would be like,

1187
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:12,424
you know, aw.net
out, okay?

1188
00:46:12,424 --> 00:46:16,610
Divided by aq.in plus,

1189
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,489
let's say, some
heat transferred

1190
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:20,889
out for process
heat, okay?

1191
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:22,369
And the nice part about

1192
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:25,529
that is that,
like, you know,

1193
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:27,050
what originally
was problematic

1194
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,129
where I needed
to take heat

1195
00:46:28,129 --> 00:46:29,329
out of my cycle
to make it run

1196
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:30,889
suddenly looks
attractive, right?

1197
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,369
That's in my
enumerator with

1198
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:34,609
an addition sign,
not a negative sign.

1199
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:36,609
And so these numbers
can get very large,

1200
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:38,459
right, 80% You know,

1201
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:39,859
you can get to a
very large number

1202
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:41,579
if you run with Cogen,

1203
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,099
and that's why it
was done, you know?

1204
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:44,779
So like this was

1205
00:46:44,779 --> 00:46:46,659
when I was when
I was a student,

1206
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:48,339
your age, there was
a very popular thing

1207
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,659
to do with gas turbines,

1208
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:52,619
Cogen, and get these
things to get up to

1209
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:56,499
a very a very high
value with that.

1210
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:58,300
So again, if you see
that in the textbook,

1211
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:58,979
I don't think we have

1212
00:46:58,979 --> 00:47:00,059
any homework
problems with it,

1213
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:00,779
but if you want to see,

1214
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:02,219
like something in this
class that's actually

1215
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:05,179
implemented and used
like that, okay?

1216
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:07,779
Um, And what are, like,

1217
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:09,259
key things in the analysis

1218
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,699
of this if you want to
get into it, right?

1219
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,379
We have this mixing
chamber, right?

1220
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:13,979
So that's, like, the
first thing. We looked

1221
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:15,179
at the mixing
chambers before.

1222
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:16,779
This is where
streams mix, okay?

1223
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:17,379
So you have

1224
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,779
sort of something
cold and something

1225
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:20,059
moderately hot and you mix

1226
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:21,539
it and it goes
into the boiler.

1227
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,099
These are isobaric, right?

1228
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,459
So they're constant
pressure. That's one.

1229
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:26,979
The second thing,
and I think

1230
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:28,700
the only other thing
that you haven't

1231
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,700
seen before is then
this process heater.

1232
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,659
What it is not
indicated on this is

1233
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:34,419
that you do have a
Q dot outer, right?

1234
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:35,860
There is a Q dot outerm,

1235
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,374
but it's one
that's actually,

1236
00:47:37,374 --> 00:47:39,089
you know, helpful for you.

1237
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,369
And in the analysis,
as it's done here,

1238
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:43,050
it goes between
like two limits,

1239
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,449
one where there's
no workout,

1240
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:45,489
another one where there's

1241
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:46,569
no process heat out,

1242
00:47:46,569 --> 00:47:48,369
and another one where
you essentially

1243
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:51,249
split MDOT streams, okay?

1244
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:52,969
So in a problem like this,

1245
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:55,809
you'd have some global
MDOT, let's say,

1246
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:58,649
11-1, and then
at this point,

1247
00:47:58,649 --> 00:48:00,089
you have to
split, and that's

1248
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:01,569
information that must
be given, right?

1249
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:03,289
So a fraction of the mass

1250
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:05,689
will go towards my
process heater, right?

1251
00:48:05,689 --> 00:48:09,449
Good. A fraction
of the mass out of

1252
00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:12,089
my turbine at relatively
high pressure

1253
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,610
will go to the
process heater.

1254
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,399
The other will
go to it, okay?

1255
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:17,389
That's it. Like, you

1256
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:18,709
know, here's a new thing.

1257
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:21,309
It's a cute out out
term and two pieces of

1258
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:24,349
information about how
much mass is diverted,

1259
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:26,229
and the rest of it
is cookie cutter.

1260
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:28,669
This is really nothing
new there, okay?

1261
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:29,989
With that, I'm going to

1262
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:31,789
close about 5
seconds early.

1263
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:32,949
If you have
questions about

1264
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,349
this, please come up.

1265
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:36,749
Otherwise, I will see
you in office hours,

1266
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:38,709
I think tomorrow at noon.

1267
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:40,189
And on Wednesday,
we start,

1268
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:42,869
I believe, with
refrigeration. Thank you.
