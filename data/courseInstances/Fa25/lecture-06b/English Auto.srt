1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Okay, so we're talking

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,800
about the second
law. Yes, please.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,340
Module one is over.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,780
No. This is the
second module, okay?

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,540
This is the second act
of our play, okay?

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,260
Or in our Tour de
France analysis, right?

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,980
Now we're entering
the Pyrenees.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,020
We climb a bit, all right?

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,740
Yeah, so after today,

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,020
you're going to be
able to complete these

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,300
you should be able to
do the following, okay?

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,860
Okay, so the first thing
we're going to start

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,780
with is the following
question, okay?

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,340
Hopefully, following

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,620
your pre work
and previewing,

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,300
I know that you've read
it all and are on it,

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,380
so you're going
to ace it, okay?

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,980
So a statement, right?

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,020
Lord Calvin said
a transformation

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,580
whose only final
result is to

21
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,060
transform into work heat

22
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,500
extracted from a source,

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,820
which is at the
same temperature

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,260
throughout is
impossible, okay?

25
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,660
I'm drawing a diagram of

26
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,180
this because I like
pictures, okay?

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,140
So here I have a
heat reservoir

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,105
at temperature T,

29
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:09,270
Um, heat is being
transferred from

30
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,310
this reservoir into
a piston. Hold on.

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,230
It's not active yet
because I'm slow.

32
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,550
I have technical
problems today.

33
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,510
In this isothermal,
expanding ideal gas,

34
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,190
and some work is being
transferred out, okay?

35
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,070
So, give me a second.
Let me activate

36
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,190
the pole because my phone

37
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,510
is also misbehaving.

38
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,470
It doesn't make me
want to go onto Module

39
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,670
two, either. Let's see.

40
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,430
Go to activities, blah,

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,190
blah, blah. Fall 2025.

42
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,910
There's our polls,

43
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,830
six B and Calvin's
statement.

44
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,190
Okay, so that's
active there.

45
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,970
Um, And so look at

46
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,610
the poll and see
basically the questions.

47
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,330
And then what we're
going to do is then

48
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,930
kind of talk through
we're going to talk

49
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,930
through some
of that, okay?

50
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,250
Are there any
questions before we

51
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,850
get started in
this activity?

52
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,650
Wonderful. Let's go.

53
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,410
F. Do,

54
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:10,190
do. Which one do I want?

55
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,950
Maybe we want this one.

56
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,630
Okay, so there
was a bunch.

57
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,990
So there's several
versions of this.

58
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,790
If you read the
book, you know,

59
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,030
they kind of say
the same thing,

60
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,030
but in different thought
experiments, okay?

61
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,590
So different thought
experiments there.

62
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,390
So, the first thing
is that, yeah,

63
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,870
what we just said, so, you

64
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,390
know, is impossible.

65
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,790
Alternatively, right,
it's impossible

66
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,430
for any device that
operates on a cycle

67
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,790
to receive heat from
a single reservoir

68
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,510
and produce a net
amount of work, right?

69
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,350
So this whole part that

70
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,390
I have to basically
contract,

71
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,590
and in order to contract,

72
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,870
it will have to cool.

73
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,390
Right? I'll
basically have to

74
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,030
take some heat out
of that system,

75
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,670
cool it in order to
come back, all right?

76
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,910
I'll probably also have

77
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,550
to put a little bit of

78
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,550
work in to compress.

79
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,470
You probably would
agree with that.

80
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,230
I'll have to do that,

81
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,390
so I'll have to
put some work in,

82
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,070
and I'll have to take
some heat out, okay?

83
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, the first law
doesn't Put any,

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,160
let's say, constraints
on this, right?

85
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,840
And here's basically
a thought experiment,

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,040
okay?

87
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,720
So let's say I
have some system

88
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,520
here, some control volume.

89
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,120
I have my single I
have my reservoir.

90
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,320
Remember, reservoir is
essentially a thing

91
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,000
a thermal reservoir
is a thing

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,040
where you can transfer
heat in and out of it,

93
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,720
and its temperature
doesn't change, right?

94
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,440
Earth is basically,
you know,

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,520
probably, for us, like
a reservoir, right?

96
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,640
You think about geothermal

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
and taking heat
out, right.

98
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,920
So you have a reservoir,
and you can transfer

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,770
some heat in, uh, to that.

100
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,650
You can transfer
some work out of it

101
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,610
and you can transfer

102
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,890
some work into
it, all right?

103
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,530
If I write the first law,

104
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,570
right, I could talk
about a workout,

105
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,570
a W in, and a Q in,

106
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,930
and I could make those
things balance, right?

107
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,970
So the first law is
not going to put any,

108
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,130
um, you know,

109
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,530
it may or may not put
any some, you know,

110
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,380
constraints, um,
constraints into it, okay?

111
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,060
But from the
second law, right,

112
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,900
as we just showed

113
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,900
basically in
that experiment,

114
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,740
in order to actually
do that as a cycle,

115
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,180
you would have to
take some heat

116
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,260
out of this in order to

117
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,860
make that in order to
make that work, okay?

118
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,180
And that's what this green

119
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,740
this Kelvin Pluck
statement says, okay?

120
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,840
It will become clearer
with time, okay?

121
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,220
All right. Yeah, then we

122
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,060
have a Clausius
postulate, okay?

123
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,540
So in Clausius, so

124
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,140
a transformation whose

125
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,180
only final result is to

126
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,740
transfer heat
from a body at

127
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,380
a given temperature
to a body at

128
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,260
a higher temperature
is impossible.

129
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,020
The way to think about

130
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,500
this experiment
is the following.

131
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,180
I have a control
volume here.

132
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,940
I have it in
diathermal, right?

133
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,860
So it's thermally
in contact with

134
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,900
a reservoir at a
high temperature

135
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,820
and also one at a
low temperature.

136
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,700
And my question is,

137
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,180
what direction does
heat flow here?

138
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,260
Loud. High to low,
yeah. Okay. Okay?

139
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,580
Things at high
concentration

140
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,340
tend to move to regions
of low concentration.

141
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,460
That's the second law.

142
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,060
That's how I understand
the second law.

143
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,420
You take a balloon, right?

144
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,580
It's compressed,
you pop it,

145
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,180
the air expands,
and it moves out,

146
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,700
you spray perfume
here, and it diffuses,

147
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,100
you make something
hot here

148
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,180
and it spreads, okay?

149
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,580
So that's essentially
what, you know,

150
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,060
the clauses
statement is that.

151
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,260
So if I have something
at a high temperature,

152
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,580
heat is going
to flow or be

153
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,980
transferred to
the regions where

154
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,460
it's then colder and

155
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,900
not the other way
around, okay?

156
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,540
Okay. Cool.

157
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,700
You can ask you
solve things like

158
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,380
why is time only
one direction.

159
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,260
Yeah, and you could think

160
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,660
about Clausius, okay?

161
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,100
Here's the first
chair of physics

162
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,740
at ETH where I used to be.

163
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,980
Um Yeah, exactly.

164
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,300
And so that's kind
of a simpler way

165
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,820
of of writing it, okay?

166
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,220
Cool. He flows by

167
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,980
conduction, blah,
blah, blah.

168
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,340
Do I have one
more? Hold on.

169
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,700
Do I have one more
drawing for you?

170
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,140
So rewriting.

171
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:11,180
Mm hm mm. Mm hm mm.

172
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,940
Yes, I think for this one,

173
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,500
we have a drawing, okay?

174
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,540
So this this statement

175
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,660
is a little bit
more tricky.

176
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,220
It was more tricky
for me when I was

177
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,500
trying to visualize it.

178
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,560
Um, I think that

179
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,120
the the way that

180
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,960
this statement
looks like is if we

181
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,160
drew a control
volume here,

182
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,440
and I said that, am

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,360
I saying that I
have a reservoir?

184
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,440
Yes, I'm saying that I

185
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,480
have a reservoir
that's maybe

186
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,680
cold and I have a
reservoir that's hot.

187
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,600
If I want to
spontaneously transfer

188
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,760
heat from the cold
into this like this,

189
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,720
this is not
possible, okay?

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,280
And this would be analogous
to the one that I

191
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,720
have to the one
that I have

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,080
written and

193
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,640
to the one that I
have written here.

194
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,200
So this version of, okay,

195
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,720
I have some system
here, whatever that is.

196
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,160
I don't have any work
transferred into it.

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,680
I cannot pump heat from
the low temperature.

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
So if TC is less than TH,

199
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,040
this is not allowed, okay?

200
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,200
For the same reason,
right, you know,

201
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,000
this is not
allowed because

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,080
heat would
basically flow in

203
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,160
the opposite direction
unless what?

204
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,480
You have to add
work, right?

205
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
And what's that device

206
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,650
usually called?
Compressor, right?

207
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,130
So in a heat
pump, basically,

208
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,010
this is your
compressor here,

209
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,170
and you'd have
some W, some W in.

210
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,170
And then, in this
case, actually,

211
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,050
this still wouldn't
be allowed.

212
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,370
What you'd end
up with is that

213
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,930
this is the QH,

214
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,330
because if you're
going to write this as

215
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,770
the first law
for, let's say,

216
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,330
a steady operating
condition here,

217
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,650
what enters it has to

218
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,010
be equal to what
goes out, right?

219
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,970
So QH then must
be equal to

220
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,690
W in plus QL, right?

221
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,810
So if I drew
this as, like,

222
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,890
a control volume,

223
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,330
it's under steady
conditions,

224
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,250
what leaves must
be equal to what's

225
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,650
entering, okay? All right.

226
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,330
Yeah. So and again,

227
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,010
in order to basically
extract heat from

228
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,450
the colder body and

229
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,170
move it to the
warmer body,

230
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,050
you have to put
some work, right?

231
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,890
You basically have to put

232
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,890
some work in, right?

233
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,530
And that's what's
shown here, right?

234
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,650
So this last statement
that we had here,

235
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,570
right, is I can't have

236
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,730
a system that
looks like this.

237
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,010
Again, heat,
essentially pumping

238
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,530
having heat move in

239
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,810
the exact opposite
direction

240
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,850
as we would
normally expect

241
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,090
without doing some
work in, all right?

242
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,410
And that's the Clausius
statement, okay?

243
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,490
Questions about
second law?

244
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,310
Sure. David, right?

245
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,870
Yes. Okay. It's
a violation

246
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,630
of Kevin Clark because.

247
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,110
So you can never
have a heat engine

248
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,590
operating on a cycle that

249
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,870
has 100% thermal
efficiency.

250
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,070
So I can never have an

251
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,390
engine that
looks like this.

252
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,590
So I can't take heat
from one reservoir,

253
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,110
put it into an engine,

254
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,190
and only get work network
out of it, right?

255
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,110
I will have to right?

256
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,150
I will basically have

257
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,310
to take some heat, right?

258
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,910
I'll basically have
to take some heat

259
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,190
out of that there, okay?

260
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,790
All right. Other
questions?

261
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,110
And this one, I mean,
at the end of it,

262
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,030
it's a more complicated
way of writing it,

263
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,750
but this one makes,
like, perfect sense,

264
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,070
right? This is
more intuitive.

265
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,830
This would basically be

266
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,870
a more intuitive thing

267
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,910
because heat doesn't
spontaneously

268
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,670
flow from regions
that are cold to

269
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,790
regions that
are hot, okay?

270
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,550
As you might
want sometimes

271
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,710
in a room, okay? Cool.

272
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,430
Yeah, so then this
so the reason

273
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,390
why this is important

274
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,870
is because for
a long time,

275
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,750
there was a bunch of
snake oil salesmen

276
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,990
out there who
were trying to,

277
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,230
like, come up with devices

278
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,550
that could beat
thermo, right?

279
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,790
The only reason why
we have really the

280
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,190
first and the
second law is

281
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,710
because no one's produced,

282
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,390
right, a machine that

283
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,310
says that it
doesn't work, okay?

284
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,390
You know, these
are postulates.

285
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,510
And believe me,
there have been some

286
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,670
very smart
people who have,

287
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,630
like, looked at that
and said, you know,

288
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,550
I'm going to be able to

289
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,750
beat it for
obvious reasons,

290
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,630
if you can beat these
laws, you could get,

291
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,950
right, fantastically
wealthy, all right?

292
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,590
Um, Ava machine.

293
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,310
So these kinds of

294
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,550
machines that
violate these laws,

295
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,150
they call them
perpetual mobile

296
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,510
or perpetual
motion machines.

297
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,910
And they can be
stated as, like,

298
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,030
either a perpetual
motion machine

299
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,630
of the first kind or
of the second kind.

300
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,190
A perpetual
motion machine of

301
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,070
the first kind means it

302
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,430
violates the
first law, okay?

303
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,630
It means that I
have more energy

304
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,270
leaving my control volume,

305
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,790
right, my system, that I

306
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,310
have energy
entering, right?

307
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,070
And you can't create
energy, right?

308
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,750
It can only be
transformed, right?

309
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,670
So those ones are

310
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,230
pretty straightforward
to analyze.

311
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,270
For the second kind, it's

312
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,990
a violation of the
second law, okay?

313
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,670
And then usually
in those cases,

314
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,070
it would be right?

315
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,550
Maybe a system like that.

316
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,710
So I have 100%
conversion of

317
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,270
work from heat on a cycle,

318
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,150
but you got to look at it.

319
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,230
You got to think
more about it.

320
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,750
It's not maybe as
straightforward,

321
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,790
okay? If you want
to see an example.

322
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,230
So the one with my
students, you know,

323
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,430
my doctoral students,

324
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,830
when I would talk
to them in this,

325
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,830
those would be like one
example, all right?

326
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,350
So you have your
pump, right?

327
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,550
You move a fluid. Let's
say it's like water.

328
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,710
I transfer heat into that.

329
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,110
So through like a boiler.

330
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,470
I run that through
a turbine.

331
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,870
I get network out, and

332
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,265
then I run it
all again, okay?

333
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:52,820
And this doesn't work,

334
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,700
okay? It doesn't
work, right?

335
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,100
For the same reason that
we mentioned before,

336
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,380
think about the piston,

337
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,540
you could have
the heat in,

338
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,820
you could get
the work out,

339
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,140
but you need to
return back to

340
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,580
the initial state, okay?

341
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,860
And you cannot
return back to

342
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,340
the initial state
without cooling, right?

343
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,540
You basically need to cool

344
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,820
off the steam here.

345
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,060
You got to condense
it down to

346
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,380
a liquid because
out of this,

347
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,540
it's still a vapor, right?

348
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,140
So, out of here,
you'd have a vapor,

349
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,700
and that vapor would
go into a pump.

350
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,180
You don't put vapor
through pumps.

351
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,220
No, no, no, all right?

352
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,580
And then, right,
it would basically

353
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,620
go back in and be that.

354
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,780
This is not something
that could operate.

355
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,755
And in Chapter ten,

356
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:30,490
Or in week ten, we'll get

357
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,170
into what are called
rank in cycles.

358
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,290
We'll get into the systems

359
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,130
and what they actually

360
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,890
should look like to
operate correctly, okay?

361
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,250
Um, Yes, okay?
That's one thing.

362
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,890
The second thing
is that when

363
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,450
we deal with
the second law,

364
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,450
we're going to talk

365
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,010
a lot about
reversible, okay?

366
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,570
Reversible,
right? So what's

367
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,570
reversible mean? It
means that, right?

368
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,170
I do something so

369
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,890
slowly that I don't

370
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,010
really have any
friction, right?

371
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,450
So it's like I
take a spring

372
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,130
and I compress
it really slow,

373
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,690
and then I let it
go and it comes

374
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,250
back to exactly where
I started, right?

375
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,490
The reason why
we're obsessed

376
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,770
with this or why
we'll use it

377
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,930
is it's going
to help us to

378
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,490
understand theoretical
limits, right?

379
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,370
So we're going to be able

380
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,250
to understand
and say, like,

381
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,330
is this perpetual
motion or not, right?

382
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,985
Is this something
that, uh,

383
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:15,160
um, you know, can
happen physically.

384
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,120
One, and then two tells
you things about,

385
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
like, what optimum
could be, right?

386
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
It's kind of like
a glass half full,

387
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,040
but you look at it
and you say, okay,

388
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,000
assuming these kind
of idealities,

389
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
is this like a
good system, okay?

390
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,120
And we're going to talk

391
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,160
about reversible,
all right?

392
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,120
Just to remind you what
that would look like,

393
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,320
right in this
video, right?

394
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,720
So we have essentially

395
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,680
the same initial states.

396
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,040
You do something
reversibly

397
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,440
versus something
irreversibly,

398
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,160
and here you can compress
a lot more, right?

399
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,720
I can do more PDV
work transfer in,

400
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,520
in the case when I
do it reversibly

401
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
compared to where it's
irreversible, right?

402
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,360
And what's happening in

403
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
an irreversible
case on the right,

404
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:59,490
physically, Yeah.

405
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,610
And so basically you
move them quickly.

406
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,530
You create some,
like, vortices,

407
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,850
right, some eddies, the
fluid moves, right?

408
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,970
So you give it

409
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,730
some kinetic energy
or movement there,

410
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,210
and then it
dissipates viscously.

411
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,330
Basically, you
warm it, right?

412
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,650
Instead of, like,
all of that work

413
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,410
going in and
compressing it,

414
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,010
it's like in the
spring example,

415
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,050
you heat up the spring.

416
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,370
You move too
quickly, and you

417
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,210
have some heating
there, okay?

418
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,250
And so that's why you see

419
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,410
the temperature
here is higher.

420
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,690
So when you do
that irreversibly,

421
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,130
it's a higher
temperature than

422
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,450
than the other
case, all right?

423
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,120
Yes, okay?

424
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,760
And again, we talked,

425
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,000
you know, a
little bit, you

426
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
know, about
efficiency before.

427
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,200
But again, when we

428
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,400
assume these idealities,

429
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,520
we're going to be
able to set, like,

430
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,920
an absolute upper limit

431
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,400
of efficiency
for the system,

432
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,640
and this is called
second law,

433
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,080
second law efficiency,

434
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,520
it allows you to rank
and say what's better.

435
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,080
And again, kind of
like a North Star,

436
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,920
it guides you. All right?

437
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,480
Yeah, so friction,
mixing, blah, blah, blah,

438
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,000
all the fun stuff

439
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,455
is what's irreversible,
all right?

440
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:06,270
Okay, so we did
perpetual emotion.

441
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,110
We talked about
the second law.

442
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,910
I want to get into
the most ideal, like,

443
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,270
the most ideal
cycle that sets

444
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,510
the absolute upper limit

445
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,510
of efficiency is
the Carnal, right?

446
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,510
So remember Carnal
Sadi Carino,

447
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,950
he was a French guy.

448
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,070
Old man worked, you
know, for Napoleon.

449
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,750
And he was obsessed with

450
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,510
making steam engines
more efficient, okay?

451
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,290
Um, And I'll take

452
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,050
you through essentially
what his cycle is,

453
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,450
and then we can talk
about the finding.

454
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,290
But in a car no, you
have four stages, okay?

455
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,450
So you have four stages.

456
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,210
The first stage is what
we already looked at

457
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,770
the heat in and the
expansion, right?

458
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,890
So I take heat from some
energy source at TH,

459
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,930
and let's say I transfer
it into the system.

460
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,490
This could be a
piston cylinder,

461
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,450
but I transfer
heat in, and I

462
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,570
undergo what's called
isothermal expansion.

463
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,485
So that's the first
thing that we looked at.

464
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:01,000
The second stage is now
I take that cylinder,

465
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,240
and instead of
transferring

466
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,645
heat in isothermally,

467
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:04,920
I suddenly
insulate it, okay?

468
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,240
It's not a
practical cycle,

469
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,965
but it's a thought
experiment, okay?

470
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,000
And I insulate it,
and then I allow it

471
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
to expand
adiabatically, okay?

472
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,405
So I have isothermal
expansion,

473
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,840
then I have
adiabatic expansion.

474
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,800
And during the
adiabatic expansion,

475
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,160
what do you think
happens to temperature?

476
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,285
If I let gas expand,

477
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:22,250
what happens to
the temperature?

478
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,690
All right. So you're
going to expect

479
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,570
basically an
adiabatic expansion.

480
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,770
Your temperature
is going to

481
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,450
go, you know, down.

482
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,690
And then at that stage,

483
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,010
you're going to
put this cylinder.

484
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,330
You're going to take
the insulation off.

485
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,450
You're going
to set it onto

486
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,690
a colder reservoir.

487
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,290
You're going to
transfer heat out

488
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,290
QL that's transferred out,

489
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,210
and then you're going to

490
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,490
do an adiabatic
compression.

491
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,810
So then you're basically
going to go in.

492
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,850
You're going to compress
this thing and then

493
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,410
basically bring it
back to the initial

494
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,410
state that you had there.

495
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,570
So this whole
part where we had

496
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,330
the heat sink and
the heat out,

497
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,810
that's a key aspect of

498
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,605
getting it back
there, all right?

499
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:01,960
Another key attribute
of the carne,

500
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,240
is it doesn't matter about

501
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,600
the substance, right?

502
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,000
It's independent
of the substance.

503
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,680
All that you care about is

504
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,760
the temperature of
the hot reservoir

505
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,640
and the temperature of
the cold reservoir.

506
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,480
And these two
things together set

507
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,560
the efficiency, right?

508
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,400
And all systems, okay,

509
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,280
if you want to make

510
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,520
any thermal engine
more efficient,

511
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,640
you essentially maximize
the temperature

512
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,240
that you get heat from,

513
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,920
and you minimize
the temperature

514
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,080
that you transfer
the heat to.

515
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,780
But really, the key
thing is you know,

516
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,860
transferring heat
from something

517
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,740
that's very,
very hot, okay?

518
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,620
That's another thing

519
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,940
the first law
didn't tell you.

520
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,620
The first law
just said that

521
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,580
conservation of
energy, right?

522
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,940
So, um, you know,

523
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,020
work and heat
are essentially,

524
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,100
you know, equivalent.

525
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,260
The second law
basically says

526
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,620
that energy has
a quality to it,

527
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,020
okay, especially with
heat, all right?

528
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,260
The warmer, you know,

529
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,300
that something is that

530
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,460
you transfer heat from,

531
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,940
the better the
quality is, the

532
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,460
more useful it
is, all right?

533
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,620
Okay.

534
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,300
Yeah, if you want to then

535
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,420
put that onto a cycle.

536
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,300
So if you want to then

537
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,220
basically see what
that would look

538
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,340
like in a cycle,
a PV diagram.

539
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,540
So here would
be one to two.

540
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,780
So the black lines are
your isotherms, right?

541
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,500
So I'm transferring
heat in one to two.

542
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,180
I'm also doing
expansion PV work.

543
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,340
Adiabatic expansion,

544
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,300
isothermal compression,

545
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,420
adiabatic
compression, right?

546
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,660
And the network then
is the area that's

547
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,700
shaded there and

548
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,900
the heat transfer
processes are shown.

549
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,140
You can also do
that on unpols

550
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,500
if you want to launch
that notebook,

551
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,300
you can also see then what

552
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,380
this process
looks like, okay?

553
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,540
Cool. So I put

554
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,140
some of you to
sleep. Yes, please.

555
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:56,500
Question? So if you
were a efficiency.

556
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,940
But it's not a
cycle, right?

557
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Because you
don't basically

558
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,900
come back to the
initial state.

559
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,280
If you want to get back
to where you started,

560
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,000
and this is what

561
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,120
we'll work through
to basically

562
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,200
get back where you
started and run a cycle,

563
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,760
if you put heat
in, you're going

564
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,680
to have to take
heat out, okay?

565
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,600
And for the ones
we've looked at here,

566
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
we're going to also be
putting some work in.

567
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,400
So there's going to
be like heat in,

568
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,680
work out, heat out,
work in, right?

569
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,720
And those four
things that I

570
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,440
mentioned there are going

571
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,240
to form the basis and

572
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,720
of a lot of

573
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,040
the cycles we're
going to look at.

574
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,160
Okay? Yes, please.
What does a graph look

575
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,720
like when it's more

576
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,480
efficient versus
less efficient?

577
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,840
What does it look
like when it's more

578
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,600
efficient versus
less efficient?

579
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,880
So how to answer that.

580
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,640
Um, I'm avoiding
saying a word.

581
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,680
I have to avoid a
property to get it.

582
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,000
I will say for now,
that really, you know,

583
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,440
if I have a very high
temperature source and

584
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,040
a relatively low
temperature sink

585
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,280
that I'm
transferring from,

586
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,640
this is essentially
going to be

587
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,160
what, you know, what
matters the most.

588
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,320
The rest of these
things are going

589
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,680
to be little details
that are there,

590
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,120
but to a leading order,

591
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,040
that's what it is.

592
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,000
And that's what
you think about.

593
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,100
If you look, for
example, um,

594
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,920
You know, what
sets essentially,

595
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,280
like the limits of
efficiencies on

596
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
our engines now is
that metal melts,

597
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
right? Like, you
could go higher.

598
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,240
You do combustion, right?

599
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,080
You could do, you know,

600
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,360
nuclear, you concentrate
solar, right?

601
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
But what sets, like
the limit then of

602
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,640
the efficiencies
of these things

603
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,920
is that at some point,

604
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,960
you know, steel stainless
steel melts, right?

605
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,040
That's in there, the
turbines go away,

606
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,000
even like some
combustion ones, right?

607
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,200
Think about aircraft
and stuff, too.

608
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,080
Yeah, you'd love
to go hotter,

609
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,560
but materials that's why

610
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,200
we have this beautiful
building, you know,

611
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,920
material scientists who
do really good work

612
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,360
to try to make these
things survive it.

613
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,880
Yes, please.

614
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,100
So 100% efficiency.
Is not possible.

615
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,060
Full stop.

616
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,380
What's the highest
efficiency? Of what?

617
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,300
Of an engine. So if you

618
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,740
want to talk about
efficiencies of,

619
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,700
like, a modern
power plant,

620
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,100
steam electric
power plant,

621
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,300
those things are north of

622
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
40 to 50%, right,
efficient.

623
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,420
What did they start
with? 1%, right?

624
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,820
Like, what, in
his day when he

625
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,700
was doing steam engines,

626
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,380
these things were, like,

627
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
less than a
percent efficient,

628
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,340
and then with time,

629
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,100
they've gotten
much better.

630
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,500
It also depends on what
you call efficiency.

631
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,420
So on this campus,

632
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,900
we used to do
co generation.

633
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,300
So it's co generation.
I put heat in.

634
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,180
I run, you know, so I
do combustion, right?

635
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,300
I run a a turbine, I
generate electricity.

636
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,780
I have that heat
that comes out.

637
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,540
That heat that comes
out, if it comes out at

638
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,580
a high enough temperature,

639
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,340
can be useful, right?

640
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,580
You can then do district
heating, right?

641
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,260
And so in those cases,

642
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,260
depending on how one
defines efficiencies,

643
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,100
those things might
be north of 80%,

644
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,540
90%, okay?

645
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,100
Because then
the heat, it's

646
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,900
not wasted, it's
used, okay?

647
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,220
And we want to
know what, like,

648
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,140
the biggest problem is
we have today is we

649
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,740
have a ton of

650
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,260
waste heat out of
a data center,

651
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,980
and we just, like, reject

652
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,460
it to, like,
the atmosphere.

653
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,420
And they call it
free cooling.

654
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,780
And there's nothing
free about that.

655
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,060
That's, like, insane.

656
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,060
Yes. Okay. Other
questions?

657
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,390
All right. So here's
what I want to do.

658
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,550
So basically, let's look.

659
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,630
So let's get into a little

660
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,750
bit of perpetual motion.

661
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,910
I mean, bear with
me for this.

662
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,270
I appreciate you guys
staying with me today,

663
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,990
but we have one of
these carno cycle.

664
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,430
Remember, we're
transferring heat

665
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,470
in from something at
constant temperature,

666
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,350
and then we're
rejecting it to

667
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,990
something that's also

668
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,110
at a constant temperature,

669
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,350
but but it's lower.

670
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,590
Let me launch the poll and

671
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,470
then can discuss
with this.

672
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,390
Blah, blah, blah.

673
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,030
Here. Okay. There we go.

674
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:50,050
Um All right, so you
want to be stingy, okay?

675
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,930
Just like I showed

676
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,650
you with the
other machine,

677
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,570
the perpetual motion, and

678
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,530
you want to
decrease QL, okay?

679
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,730
Instead of compressing

680
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,810
isothermally from
state three to four,

681
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,130
you decided to do it
adiabatically, okay?

682
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,970
Right? So you're
at state three,

683
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,330
and instead of
going to four,

684
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,690
you do adiabatic
compression.

685
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,570
So the first question is

686
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,890
what state do
you end up at?

687
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,450
And two, what do
you expect to

688
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,725
happen to Wt out, okay?

689
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:18,520
Really appreciate your
support in the class.

690
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,320
Look through this.

691
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,080
And if you get this,

692
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,520
you understand the
second law, and,

693
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,800
you know, the rest
of this course

694
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,040
is going to be
very easy for you.

695
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Okay? If you have
questions, I'm circulating.

696
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,200
D do, did do. Okay.

697
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,090
Um Yeah,

698
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,130
so this is what's called

699
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,210
the fully
reversible cycle.

700
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,970
You know, you can

701
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,370
basically you can
reverse this thing.

702
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,770
And if you run
it in reverse,

703
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,970
instead of it being
a thermal engine,

704
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,330
it is a heat pump, okay?

705
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,770
So you can run a Karno to

706
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,250
produce, you know, power,

707
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,250
but you can also run
a Karno to pump heat.

708
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,090
It's just that
one is clockwise,

709
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,810
and the heat pump is
counterclockwise, right,

710
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,690
in terms of the way
the directions look.

711
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,530
And with that, I'm
going to close it.

712
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,130
Thank you so much,

713
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,330
Dave, for your
participation,

714
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,530
me giving you
two questions.

715
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,210
I love that. Also the
