1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
All right, I got 210.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,480
I'm going to get started.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,080
So today we're
talking about

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,840
Exergy another E.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,720
So after today, you're

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,800
able to define
the concept of

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,280
exergy destruction as it

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,200
relates to entropy
generation, right?

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,480
Remember that's we spent

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,319
the last five
lectures doing.

11
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:21,280
And then you should be
able to define Exergy,

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,439
which is the maximum work.

13
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,319
Basically, you can
get out of a system,

14
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,639
right, from a
specified state, okay?

15
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:34,749
Yeah, so It's like this.

16
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:37,109
One of the
longstanding goals

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,350
of thermodynamics

18
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,749
was to figure out
how much you could

19
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,029
squeeze out of a
system, right?

20
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:43,629
Like, how much if I

21
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:44,510
have this much heat

22
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,589
or whatever
coming in, like,

23
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:47,709
how much work can I get,

24
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,789
you know, out of it?

25
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,789
That's one thing you

26
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:52,509
should have in your mind.

27
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,229
The second important
part about this is if

28
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,190
we think about getting
maximum workout,

29
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,710
we're probably
going to be dealing

30
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,669
with reversible
cases, right?

31
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:03,430
So isotropic cases of

32
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,869
work transfer
as we go from

33
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:07,479
one state to the other.

34
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,049
That kind of other
state that we go

35
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,929
towards is kind of
like a ground state.

36
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:13,809
We're going to call that

37
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:15,129
like a dead state, right?

38
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:16,569
If you spend a
lot of time on

39
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:18,849
the Internet like myself
and reading, okay,

40
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,849
you'll hear things
about like heat death,

41
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,289
you know, of the
universe, right,

42
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:23,449
where everything becomes

43
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:25,010
eventually the
same temperature,

44
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,049
and we have no Delta T.

45
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,329
We're not there
yet, all right?

46
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,649
So we need a delta
to drive things.

47
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,569
But there's a dead
state involved, right?

48
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,629
And if through a process,

49
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:42,130
We have some
irreversibilities,

50
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,049
which we had said before,

51
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,969
we're essentially,
you know,

52
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,849
we talked about
isotropic efficiencies,

53
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,489
essentially, you
know, something that

54
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:51,090
is not necessarily
reversible.

55
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,889
The process of
doing it maybe

56
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,050
generates some friction,

57
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,849
some heat, basically,

58
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,849
some entropy is created.

59
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,729
That is associated with

60
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,369
exergy destruction.
All right?

61
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,850
So what I told
you, entropy,

62
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,169
entropy is maybe
a little bit

63
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:05,449
like the glagraph is
half empty, right?

64
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:06,809
A bit of Schopenhauer,

65
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,570
you know, like,
pessimistic thinking.

66
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,690
Exergy is a little bit

67
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,530
the other half of that.

68
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,130
Maybe more
optimistic, like,

69
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,610
you know,

70
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,170
how much work could
I get out of it?

71
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,200
Not how much am I
destroying? Okay.

72
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,150
All right. But I think

73
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,709
before I really get into
the math of Exergy,

74
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:21,915
I think it's helpful

75
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,360
I thought about
this today,

76
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,199
and I thought it
would be helpful if I

77
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,239
first started with
entropy generation.

78
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,159
So going through a
process of analyzing

79
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,679
entropy generation
for another system

80
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,999
we haven't spent
time with a nozzle.

81
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,039
And through that analysis

82
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,399
of entropy generation,

83
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,759
I'm going to relate
this directly

84
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,160
to Erogey destruction,

85
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,279
which is going to
be Ero destruction

86
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,680
is equal to entropy
generation times,

87
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
let's say the
environmental temperature,

88
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,400
which we call is the
dead state there, okay?

89
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,039
And then we'll
wade in, right?

90
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,480
So we'll kind of
gently go into

91
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
the exergetic
waters this way.

92
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,960
All right. And then
you can tell me

93
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
if that's any
less confusing

94
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,520
to last year's cohort.

95
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,320
All right, so we're

96
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
dealing with a
nozzle here.

97
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,080
So a nozzle looks
like this, right?

98
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,999
So the purpose of

99
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,920
a nozzle is that
you want to take

100
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,600
a fluid stream at
some velocity and

101
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,879
accelerate it to a
much faster velocity,

102
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,560
right?

103
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,240
So that means
we're going to

104
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,240
have some gas flowing
in, some going out.

105
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,040
We can call this the
entrance as state one,

106
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,559
and the exit for
the purposes of

107
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:25,840
determining properties
as state two.

108
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,200
And as usual,
if you want to

109
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,680
follow along with that,
you can do it there,

110
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,480
but I'm going to close

111
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,360
this off because there's

112
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,279
a reflection on the board,

113
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,680
okay? We're
dealing with air.

114
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
So our substance
here is we have

115
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,999
air that's entering
and exiting.

116
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,560
Um, It enters at

117
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,319
200 pa and 65
degrees Celsius,

118
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,279
and the velocity
that it's entering

119
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,800
with is 35 meters/second.

120
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,000
It exits at 95 kp

121
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,280
and a velocity of
240 meters/second.

122
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,720
That's pretty
quick, right?

123
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,530
And we have
some heat loss.

124
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,569
There's some heat
loss from the nozzle.

125
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,970
And we're told that

126
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,449
this Q is on a
per mass basis,

127
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:24,850
and it's three
kilojoules per kilogram.

128
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,610
And the surrounding
temperature

129
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,249
T maybe I'll give
it a variable T

130
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:34,729
surrounding for now is

131
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,610
equal to 17
degrees Celsius.

132
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,049
And what we want to
determine, determine

133
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,479
We'd like to determine
is the T two,

134
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
that's the exit
temperature.

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,479
B, we would like

136
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,879
to determine the E.

137
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,080
It says X org destruction,

138
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,279
but I believe that I'm

139
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,720
also talking
about entropy.

140
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,425
B, basically, we'll talk
about X destruction.

141
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:17,369
Exergy destroyed, I think,

142
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,689
we'll call it maybe
exergy destroyed.

143
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,129
And the variable for that

144
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,769
because why the
heck not is X.

145
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:27,369
Confusingly, the
variable for

146
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,609
exergy on a per mass
basis here is little X,

147
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:32,729
just like our vapor
quality was X.

148
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,449
I don't make the
rules, right?

149
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,810
I'm just the messenger.

150
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,329
And this has units,

151
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,929
in this case is

152
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:42,594
kilojoules per
kilogram, all right?

153
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:47,900
There. Great. I'll give
the answer already.

154
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,580
So the answer that

155
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,819
we're going to get out
of this is going to

156
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,979
be 34 degrees Celsius,

157
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:53,899
and the exit you

158
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,619
destroyed here
is going to be

159
00:05:55,619 --> 00:06:00,540
36.9 kilojoules
per kilogram.

160
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,259
I'll just go through

161
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,819
the analysis of how
we arrive at that.

162
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,460
All right, first step in

163
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,979
thermo is we're going
draw a boundaries.

164
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,579
So we'll draw a
control volume

165
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,569
around the bonzle here.

166
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,249
Okay, looks like that.

167
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:18,610
And what assumptions
do we have, right?

168
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,729
So we have a
control volume.

169
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,089
So we've got mass
entering, right,

170
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,969
carrying energy
in and out.

171
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,409
Because this
is air, right?

172
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:28,690
We could choose
to use Pi Killor

173
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,050
to compute differences

174
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,649
in things like enthalpy,

175
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,009
but we could
also treat this

176
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,209
as an ideal gas, right?

177
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,889
So I can use CP Delta Ts

178
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,969
also to compute the
same enthalpy changes.

179
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:43,089
We cannot neglect,
so we cannot

180
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:48,249
neglect changes in
kinetic energy, right?

181
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:49,809
We're not going
to do that here

182
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,849
because the whole point
of this device is to,

183
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:55,490
to take enthalpy
and convert it into

184
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,329
velocity into
kinetic energy here.

185
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,730
We will, however, still

186
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,049
neglect changes in
potential energy.

187
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,099
It's a steady flow
process, right?

188
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:10,059
So there's no
change, right?

189
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:13,139
So our Delta M CV,

190
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,339
the change in
the mass of the

191
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,700
control volume is zero,

192
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,259
and the change
in the energy

193
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,499
in the control
volume is zero.

194
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:27,019
And also the change
in entropy in

195
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,699
the control volume is

196
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,339
also equal to zero, right?

197
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,259
Single inlet,
single outlet.

198
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,059
So our m.in
because of this,

199
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:40,590
dm dt of the control
volume is equal to m.in.

200
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,879
Right, minus our dot out,

201
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,959
which from this, right
is equal to zero,

202
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,119
right, which basically
implies that our.in is

203
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:54,680
equal to our dot out
is equal to m dot.

204
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,119
So we got everything
set up there.

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,479
Okay, um, we can

206
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,119
write our conservation
of energy.

207
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,599
So we did our
conservation of mass.

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,999
Our conservation
of energy,

209
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,239
is the, um, um,

210
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,679
right, the rate of
change of energy,

211
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,919
the control volume
is equal to

212
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,840
e.in, minus E dot out.

213
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,290
Um, From the steady
flow assumption,

214
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,329
E dot N is equal to
e dot out, right?

215
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:25,929
So we have w.in plus
q.in plus our dot N,

216
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,409
which we just call dot,

217
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,649
enthalpy at state one

218
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:33,609
plus the velocity at
state one squared

219
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:36,810
plus g one is equal to

220
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,850
our dot out plus
our Q dot out,

221
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,690
plus our dot out,
which I'll just.h2,

222
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,010
enthalpy at the exit
velocity squared

223
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,250
at the exit, plus gz two.

224
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,090
All right. What goes away

225
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,890
here is we don't
have heat in, right?

226
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,810
We have heat out.
So this is gone.

227
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,050
There is no work transfer,

228
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,290
so there's no shaft work.

229
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,170
There's no shaft work done

230
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,369
in or out of that device.

231
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:09,850
So that's gone. We
do have a heat out.

232
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,050
We're going to
neglect the changes

233
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,330
in potential energy as
we were told to do.

234
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,090
And we have a Q dot.
We have a Q dot out.

235
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,830
And what

236
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,550
we're searching for it
through this equation,

237
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,630
we need to determine
state two.

238
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,550
We know the pressure
at state two,

239
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,270
but we don't have any
other information.

240
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,149
And so we're going
to use this equation

241
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,310
essentially to solve

242
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,510
for the enthalpy
at state two.

243
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,750
And once we know the
enthalpy at state two,

244
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,350
with that pressure,
we're going to

245
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,110
be able to
determine T two.

246
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,389
So with rearranging here,

247
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,070
specific enthalpy
at state two

248
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,789
is equal to H one plus

249
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,470
velocity one
squared divided by

250
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,910
two minus velocity
two squared,

251
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,839
um, divided by

252
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,839
two and minus little
Q out, right?

253
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,640
And just to remind
you, little Q out,

254
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,840
in this case would
be capital Q

255
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,399
dot out divided
by m dot, right?

256
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
So this divided by

257
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,720
that is by
definition this,

258
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,960
and the units of it are in

259
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,120
kilojoules per
kilogram, right?

260
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,349
Cool.

261
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,670
And so there's two
ways to do that.

262
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,950
So one is that we could

263
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,670
just use Pi color
to determine,

264
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,510
so we know state one.

265
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,470
State one from state one,

266
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,950
we know P one, and
we know T one,

267
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,590
which means that
I'll know H one

268
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,390
and one S one from that,

269
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,870
so I could substitute
the H one into here.

270
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,830
I'm given the velocity
at state one.

271
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,630
I'm given the velocity
at state two,

272
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,110
and I'm given the key

273
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,349
transferred out per
mass from the nozzle.

274
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:52,430
So it means that I would

275
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,870
know right from this,

276
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,085
I would know
then state two.

277
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:59,900
So from that, right,
I would know H

278
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,620
two and P two is given.

279
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,060
And so what it means
is that I know T two

280
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,180
and also S two
if I needed it.

281
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,899
Totally valid approach.

282
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,300
Another way we could do

283
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,429
this is we could
start off by

284
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:24,510
writing H two minus
H one is equal to,

285
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,229
right, W one
squared divided by

286
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,990
two minus velocity
at state two

287
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,270
squared divided by
two minus Q out.

288
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,110
And for an ideal gas,

289
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,870
we can take

290
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,510
the specific heat at
some temperature,

291
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,950
assuming that the CP

292
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,790
doesn't change a lot

293
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,310
over the
temperature range,

294
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,549
temperature at state
two minus temperature

295
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,230
at state one is equal
to the right hand side.

296
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,390
We can reorganize,
and we can write

297
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,590
T two is equal to T one.

298
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,390
Um, T two is
equal to T one

299
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,189
plus velocity one squared

300
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:08,310
divided by two
minus velocity two

301
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,390
squared divided by two
minus little Q out,

302
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,429
and all of that
divided by CP,

303
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:19,610
okay? Totally
valid, right?

304
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,330
Because we can do this for

305
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,930
changes in enthalpy
for an ideal gas

306
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,090
or can be related to

307
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,890
changes in temperature
through CP, okay?

308
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,210
So these are the two
ways you could go to get

309
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,130
to state two, right?

310
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,570
Which would answer
our first problem

311
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,810
and the answer I've
already given you there.

312
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,490
Are there questions
about this?

313
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,010
Clear? All right.

314
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,809
This should be a cake
walk, all right?

315
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:51,110
Good. Um, All right.

316
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,229
Now we come to the
entropy generation

317
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:58,390
and for entropy
generation,

318
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,350
again, we stick with our
same control volume,

319
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,230
the same green dashed
line that I had before.

320
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,710
The rate of change of

321
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,309
entropy in the
control volume,

322
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,109
DSVDT is equal to the
rate that entropy

323
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,109
enters the control volume

324
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:21,630
minus the rate
that it leaves it,

325
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,880
plus the rate That it's
it's generated, okay?

326
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,520
And the ways that
we can carry

327
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,479
entropy into
control volume,

328
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,720
we could have heat
work, no, right?

329
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,160
Work is not a way

330
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,599
that we're going to
bring entropy in.

331
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,279
Heat is a way we'll
bring entropy

332
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,200
in and flow, right,
a fluid, right?

333
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,280
I can take a
fluid, and that

334
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,519
can possess entropy,

335
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,760
and that can and
that can come in.

336
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,720
There's a steady
flow process.

337
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,800
So from my assumption
I said before,

338
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,440
I don't have any
change in entropy

339
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,120
of the control volume.
I have a balance.

340
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,280
The rate that
is coming in is

341
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,399
the rate that
it's leaving.

342
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,400
And so this means that
it's zero, you know,

343
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,040
analogous to what
we had for the rate

344
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,449
of change of energy
and also of mass.

345
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,780
Um, again, we
need to get to

346
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,100
the formula that
we're interested

347
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,700
in is going to
rely on Gen.

348
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,580
So what we're going to

349
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,540
do is we're going
to say that

350
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,340
capital S dot gen is equal

351
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,020
to dot out minus s.in.

352
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,300
All right. What
are the ways that

353
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,419
entropy is leaving
that control volume?

354
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,460
Name? Andrew.
Andrew? Yeah, we

355
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,619
have Mass leaving.

356
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:36,459
Okay, so we have an MDOT,

357
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,179
right a Mass Flory,

358
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,259
and we have a little S
to a specific entropy

359
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,420
at state two.

360
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,020
How else is
entropy leaving?

361
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,580
Heat, right?
Name? Z. Zach.

362
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,419
It's always nice to

363
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:51,700
claim it after
it was right.

364
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,860
Okay, right?

365
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,339
So that's leaving.

366
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,060
So there we have a Q out.

367
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,580
So we know some
heat's leaving,

368
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,860
but that's not
exactly entropy yet.

369
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,740
Where is that heat

370
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,980
being transferred
to, right?

371
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,699
So we have a
reduction in entropy

372
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,859
because it's leaving

373
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:11,979
the it's leaving
the system.

374
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:15,690
And where is it going
to? Surrounding, right?

375
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,210
Yeah. So we have here a Q

376
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,489
out that's then divided

377
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:25,489
by excuse me, a T zero.

378
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:29,090
And how is entry
P coming in?

379
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,270
So the other fluid.

380
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,430
So basically, you
have also an dot,

381
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,190
and that's times
S one there.

382
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,590
Cool. So we can
rearrange this?

383
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,030
We just go dot,

384
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:54,030
then S two minus
one plus this Q out

385
00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:01,310
divided by T and T zero.

386
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,350
And this is our
dot dot gen

387
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,869
will look like
that. Mm hmm.

388
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,910
If I divide both sides,

389
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,790
so I need to think
carefully about this.

390
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,470
Hold on. M dot.

391
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,670
This also has an M dot.

392
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,990
I apologize. I apologize.

393
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,230
This should be plus
dot times that.

394
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,430
And then therefore, dot

395
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,430
should also be
there because this

396
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,950
is per kilojoules per

397
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,430
kilogram and
then per kelvin.

398
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,230
So this is the same
units of little S,

399
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,310
and that also needs to
multiply it by dot.

400
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,800
All right. Boo boo. Okay.

401
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,440
We can write this in
little S notation.

402
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,280
So if I divide
both sides by dot,

403
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,480
little dot,

404
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,520
what I'm going to
be able to write,

405
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,040
maybe I'll put it
up here is that

406
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,840
little Gn is then
equal to two

407
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:12,299
minus one plus Q out
divided by T zero.

408
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,299
And the definition, this

409
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,500
is something I'm going
to tell you now.

410
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,859
So this is
informational, and then

411
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,780
we'll come into
the meaning

412
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,419
of it in a second.

413
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,579
But the connection
between entropy

414
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,739
generated an energy
is the following.

415
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:31,659
Little X destroyed
destroyed is

416
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:35,259
equal to little S Gen

417
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,740
times what's

418
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,300
called the dead
state temperature,

419
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,539
essentially the

420
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:41,900
temperature of
the surroundings.

421
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,099
The temperature when
everything else

422
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,580
has gone to equilibrium.

423
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,140
All right? Not
heat death yet.

424
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,779
Okay. But T zero there.

425
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:54,909
All right. All right.

426
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,670
And so how do
we get to SGN?

427
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,229
So we know S two.

428
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,429
So if we followed

429
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,229
the Pi color
approach, right?

430
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,229
I could get little
S two from that,

431
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:08,229
right from knowing
state one.

432
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:10,229
Little, I'm sorry,

433
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:11,989
little S two from
knowing state two,

434
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,470
Little S one from knowing

435
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,950
state one Q is given,

436
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,749
and T zero is
also given as the

437
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:20,270
surrounding the
surrounding temperatures.

438
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,469
So we'd call T
zero equal to

439
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:26,709
T T surrounding, right?

440
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:30,949
What's another way
that we could get to

441
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,270
this change in entropy

442
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,710
across a nozzle for air?

443
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,909
If I know the
temperature and

444
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:44,869
I know the pressure
at the inlet of

445
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:46,829
my nozzle and I know
my temperature and

446
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:49,269
the pressure at the
outlet of my nozzle,

447
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,949
is there any formula
we can use for

448
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:52,470
an ideal gas to compute

449
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,989
the difference
in the entropy?

450
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,870
Yes, please. Name?

451
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,379
Nat. Something like that.

452
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:03,459
CPDT would be the change

453
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,619
in enthalpy,
though, right?

454
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,619
So CD is what I had there.

455
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:12,140
Other name? Brian.

456
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,380
That's incredible. I don't

457
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,019
remember from shorthand,
but it sounds.

458
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:19,140
So it won't just be
that because I have

459
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,100
changes in temperature

460
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,179
and changes in pressure.

461
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,899
But the formula you want
to be looking up are

462
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:25,179
the so called TDS
relations, right?

463
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,459
Remember, we derived this.

464
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,860
So we had TDS relations

465
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,659
that we derived
from the first law,

466
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,750
and we made assumptions

467
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,069
about the changes
in internal energy

468
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:40,270
being right CV dt and
so on and so forth.

469
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,229
And the point is that we

470
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:42,429
were able to
relate changes in

471
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:43,910
entropy to changes

472
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,350
in temperature
and pressure,

473
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,790
pressure and volume,

474
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,429
specific volume and
temperature, okay?

475
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,390
So if you look at
the TDS relations,

476
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,789
you could also
follow that approach

477
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,429
for an ideal gas
to compute that.

478
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,789
Again, totally valid
approach, right?

479
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,989
Okay. And he's
going to look

480
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:01,029
it up later for
you all and

481
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:02,229
remember the
second half of

482
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:04,669
the formula.
Questions about this.

483
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,920
Okay, so that's exergy.

484
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,999
That's pretty much
it. All right.

485
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,519
So this is the
destruction part of it,

486
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,440
but we can also get

487
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,760
into into the other parts.

488
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,719
But this is really
then the link of

489
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,239
the entropy generation and

490
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:19,159
ultimately
exergy analysis.

491
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:20,959
And I would consider
this analysis

492
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,560
to be a modern,

493
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,000
basically a modern
thermodynamic analysis.

494
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,079
So if you think
about where things

495
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,579
are and why is it modern?

496
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:30,400
For devices like this,

497
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,280
kind of the performance
is maybe obvious.

498
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,679
Like, you look at that
and you think, okay,

499
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,400
that's kind of faster,
that's slower.

500
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,800
But the energy systems

501
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,279
nowadays are a lot more
hybridized, right?

502
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,799
They're a lot more
hybrid, okay?

503
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,999
They're more complex,
and as a result, why?

504
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,519
Why are they more
complex? They're more

505
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,560
complex because
we receive the

506
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,640
energy intermittently.

507
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,999
Nothing is steady, right?

508
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,479
So, you know, we have

509
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,479
day and night,
we have seasons.

510
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,610
One, Two,

511
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,849
we use our energies at

512
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,129
different times for
all sorts of things,

513
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:58,929
buildings, you know, cars,

514
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,450
you know, manufacturing,

515
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,690
so the loads are
complicated.

516
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,489
And so you end up

517
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:03,730
with these
complicated systems,

518
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,809
and being able to
say what is the

519
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:08,409
best is not obvious, okay?

520
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:10,169
So what you need to
do is you have to

521
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,929
come up with a
framework where, again,

522
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:13,850
you kind of treat and rank

523
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,689
energy forms equally.
Heat and work.

524
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,329
You can put on, you know,

525
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:21,369
essentially the same
conversion there, right?

526
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:22,929
The same, let's say,

527
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:24,649
quality in a
sense to them.

528
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:27,049
And this is what
exergy does, right?

529
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,209
It's a way of being able

530
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,289
to say that I can compare

531
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,490
apples to apples and
not apples to oranges.

532
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,249
The first law is tells you

533
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:34,530
things are apples
to apples,

534
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,289
but it's not true.

535
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:36,489
The second law tells you

536
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:37,769
that work and heat
are different,

537
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:39,529
and what EG tries to do is

538
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:40,289
to correct for

539
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:41,610
the fact that
they're different,

540
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,770
that heat is worth less
than work, alright?

541
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,089
Good. Alright, let's
go in, though.

542
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,849
Do I want to do
this example

543
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,129
yet? I could. Yeah.

544
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:58,129
Let's do this one,
and then I can

545
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,370
go through some
definitions.

546
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,609
So the context of this
is that here we did

547
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:05,210
this for a steady flow
analysis of a nozzle,

548
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:05,929
a system I really

549
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:07,250
didn't spend much
time with before.

550
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,489
And what I want to do now

551
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:10,370
is the entropy generation

552
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,449
and the exergey
destruction

553
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,250
then of this system,
right, a closed system.

554
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,969
And with these
two, you will have

555
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,009
enough seen enough
examples there

556
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,930
to kind of tackle
both types

557
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,574
of systems when it
comes to exergy.

558
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:26,379
All right.

559
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,579
I also have to say that

560
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,180
I really like
the textbook.

561
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,939
I really like
the textbook,

562
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:53,219
except for this part.

563
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:55,019
So if you read
the textbook and

564
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:56,899
they do this analysis,

565
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:58,780
I find it downright
confusing.

566
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,700
So what I'm going to do

567
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,219
today is an example
that they have,

568
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:02,739
but like my way in

569
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:05,339
the way I've taught
you before, okay?

570
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,099
And if you come to

571
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,420
my office hours
and you tell me,

572
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,059
I don't get why the
book did it that way,

573
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,819
I'm not going to my
answer is going to

574
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:15,779
be do it this way.
Do it my way.

575
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,859
Okay, so what do
we have here?

576
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:21,699
So we have our
favorite piston, okay,

577
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:24,779
that contains water at

578
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,339
100 degrees C.
We have heat.

579
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,579
We draw our boundary here.

580
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,059
The piston is kept at

581
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,669
constant pressure. And
it's being cooled.

582
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:35,469
So there's some
amount of heat that's

583
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:36,629
transferred out
between state

584
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:37,749
two and state one,

585
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,590
and this heat is

586
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,909
transferred to
a surroundings,

587
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:41,469
which is 25 degrees C. T

588
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:42,790
surrounding here is code

589
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,269
for dead state, okay?

590
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,190
So you have your dead
state temperature,

591
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,629
which is here.

592
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:47,469
All the rest of

593
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,870
the terminology
you've heard before,

594
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,110
water means no ideal gas.

595
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,470
You're gonna use Pikere.
Condensation here.

596
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,949
So as we transfer
heat out,

597
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:56,430
some of the water
is condensed.

598
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,629
That's code four
isothermal, right?

599
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:00,110
I said it was isobaric.

600
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,989
That's, you know,

601
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,469
the system allows
you to do that,

602
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:04,309
but phase change
processes are

603
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,909
both isoberic
and isothermal.

604
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,389
So the constant
temperature

605
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:09,350
there is going
to mean that,

606
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,989
like, you know,
maybe that's useful,

607
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:14,030
okay? This work transfer.

608
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,389
So because he's
being transferred

609
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,749
out and the pistons
moving down,

610
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,189
works being
transferred in, okay?

611
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,070
A keyword here
is frictionless.

612
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,230
What do you think
frictionless

613
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,589
means for this?
What's that code for?

614
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,749
Okay, I'm going to
start on this side.

615
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,389
A brave soul in
the back there,

616
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:34,670
Paris. Reversible.

617
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,950
Yes. Okay, reversible.

618
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,030
And when I have a
reversible system,

619
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,469
okay, but the
thing is that

620
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,069
I have heat being
transferred out.

621
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,949
So when I have heat
being transferred out of

622
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,230
a system where I'm

623
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,149
reversibly doing work,
what did we call that?

624
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,430
So it's like the work
transfer process

625
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,710
is isotropic,

626
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,630
but there's a
change in entropy

627
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,309
due to heat, okay?

628
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:02,269
So I have heat being

629
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,750
transferred out of
that control volume,

630
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,109
so I have a change
in entropy,

631
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:05,870
but I have no change in

632
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,549
entropy associated
with the work process.

633
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,229
So the word
reversible is in it.

634
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,990
I'm going to make you
all read the book.

635
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,149
I'm going to have
a lecture, and

636
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:16,429
it's going to be reading
time, all right?

637
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:17,510
You're going to
have free choice

638
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,909
and there's going to be

639
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:21,669
one choice internally
reversible, right?

640
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:23,429
So what formula do I write

641
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:23,989
when I have something

642
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,389
that's internally
reversible?

643
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:38,609
Oh, man, ds is equal
to dq divided by T,

644
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:42,129
right? Internally
reversible, okay?

645
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:44,169
Why do I do this? Why
do I care about this?

646
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,249
The whole reason why
we do that is because

647
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:49,250
if the work transfer
process is isotropic,

648
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,249
I can determine
the change in

649
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,369
entropy of that only

650
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:53,769
with heat transfer, right?

651
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,449
So we write all
of this because

652
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:56,930
not because I
like letters,

653
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,729
you know, I love letters,

654
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:59,049
but I don't write
all of them.

655
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:00,649
I wish we had more.
I don't write

656
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:02,449
all of that
because I want to.

657
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,129
You do that
because then I can

658
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,809
compute changes in entropy

659
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,129
only with the heat, okay?

660
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,089
The other part
that's like code in

661
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,969
this problem is
these isothermal,

662
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,170
when we do the
integration,

663
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,569
it's going to make
this very easy, right?

664
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:14,810
I'm going to be
able to integrate

665
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,009
this and take the
temperature out.

666
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,369
So a process
like this that's

667
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,130
isothermal makes
that a very easy

668
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,690
calculation in
terms of a change

669
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,249
in entropy of this control
volume, all right?

670
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:27,720
Okay, so with that setup,

671
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,229
Let's dive into it, right?

672
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,389
So we've already
drawn our schematic.

673
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:36,789
I don't need to indicate
anything else there.

674
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,989
It's a closed system,
so no mass in or out.

675
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:39,830
The properties,

676
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,109
if we needed to
determine them,

677
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:42,270
if we needed to
determine them,

678
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,510
we'd use PiKLor.

679
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,710
And this problem,
actually, we don't need to

680
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,030
because we know the
initial temperature,

681
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,509
we know the final
temperature.

682
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,070
And for this type
of calculation,

683
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,190
I don't need to
know things like

684
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,269
enthalpy and internal
energy there.

685
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:57,309
So there's enough
information from that.

686
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:59,509
It's quasi equilibrium,
all right?

687
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:00,589
We have no changes in

688
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,630
kinetic and
potential energy.

689
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,630
All right? The only
kind of work we're

690
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,509
having here is this
internally reversible,

691
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:09,510
um, you know, compression,

692
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,750
which is here,
and we have heat

693
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,960
lost heat loss to
the surrounding.

694
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,529
Do do.

695
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,689
Okay, so I'm not
going to start

696
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:21,609
with an energy balance

697
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:23,129
here because I do not
need to. All right.

698
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:24,649
For other problems,
you would need to,

699
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:25,489
you probably would need to

700
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:26,609
determine a final state.

701
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:28,410
Here I know the
final temperature,

702
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,729
so I don't need
to do that.

703
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:30,969
So I'll simply start with

704
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:33,290
an entropy balance
for a closed system.

705
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,729
Entropy balance for
a control system is

706
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:39,489
equal.in minus S dot out

707
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:43,009
plus dot gen is equal to

708
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,490
the change in the entropy

709
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,009
of that control volume,

710
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:50,869
which I'm going to call
as Delta S system.

711
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,109
All right. We have no
change of mass, right?

712
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:57,429
There's no mass in or
out of that, okay?

713
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:00,029
This is the trick to
this problem, okay?

714
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,429
So if you start down

715
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,429
this and you draw
it for that,

716
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:07,309
just a single control
volume, good luck.

717
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:09,429
You're going to have
to do weird stuff.

718
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:10,909
So what I recommend doing,

719
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,309
and this is essentially
what the book does

720
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:16,750
is that we'll have our
piston and the piston.

721
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,949
So our piston
cylinder device.

722
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,990
I'll draw one
control volume,

723
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,310
which in this
case contains

724
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,259
the water. All right.

725
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,289
And then I'm going to
draw another, right?

726
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,169
So I have heat being

727
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:30,770
transferred to
the surrounding.

728
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,570
And the other
control volume

729
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,610
that I'm going to draw is

730
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,129
essentially the part of

731
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:37,649
the surroundings that
gets heated, okay?

732
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,690
So I would go here and
do something weird,

733
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,849
or maybe I'll draw
a control volume,

734
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:46,369
which looks something
like this, okay?

735
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,109
Yeah, maybe it looks
like this, right?

736
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:52,149
So I'll have
something that

737
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,510
looks like that, right?

738
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,989
And this should trigger
a response in you.

739
00:28:57,989 --> 00:28:59,270
The fact that I'm drawing

740
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,470
two control volumes,

741
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,589
one where heat's
being lost,

742
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,829
and another where
heat is being gained.

743
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:06,029
Does anyone remember what

744
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:08,349
exercise I did for that?

745
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,589
I took a hot
piece of iron and

746
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:14,314
I dropped it into
cold water, okay?

747
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:18,279
Every single quiz and
midterm I have ever

748
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:20,399
given has had an entropy
generation problem

749
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,959
and an entropy
change, okay?

750
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,119
And they all
look something

751
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,359
like that. All right?

752
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,160
So here, I have
something hot,

753
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,479
entropy he's being
transferred out of it.

754
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,279
That means entropy
is decreasing,

755
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,199
and then heat's being

756
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,239
transferred to
something else,

757
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,959
and the entropy
is increasing.

758
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,559
And because this is
hotter than this,

759
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,680
the net change, right?

760
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,959
And so heat being

761
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,519
transferred out of
something as hot as

762
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,560
a smaller change in
entropy than heat

763
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,599
being transferred
into something

764
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,720
at a lower temperature,

765
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,040
which will have a
higher one because it

766
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,359
goes by one over T, okay?

767
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,040
So this is the trick.

768
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,129
You basically draw, All

769
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,409
right, maybe I need
to do it right.

770
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:59,729
So, like, you basically
draw a second,

771
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,690
right, control volume
around the first one.

772
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,969
What the book calls
this part of it,

773
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:09,810
the book calls this,
like a boundary.

774
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,130
Allright? I don't
know, like a boundary.

775
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,370
So they draw
some boundary,

776
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,009
and they say, okay,

777
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:16,930
then somehow the,
you know, the heat,

778
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,009
and blah, blah, blah.
I prefer precision.

779
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:19,929
So for me, I'm going to

780
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:21,289
draw control volume
of the water,

781
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,330
and then I'm going to draw

782
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,329
a control volume around

783
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:24,809
this piston cylinder where

784
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:25,929
the heat's being
transferred

785
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,089
into it, all right?

786
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:33,849
Okay. Super.
Now, all right.

787
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:37,699
Um, overall change,

788
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:39,259
right? So the
overall change.

789
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:41,899
So if I talk
about this as,

790
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:43,859
you know, we can
talk about this

791
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:45,299
maybe as the water,

792
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,419
and we can talk
about this one as

793
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:49,900
the surrounding,

794
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,819
just like we did
before, the change in

795
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:55,619
the entropy of this
combined system, right?

796
00:30:55,619 --> 00:31:00,460
So Delta S system,

797
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,379
which is essentially this

798
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:03,619
control volume of water

799
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:05,419
plus this control volume

800
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:07,099
of the surrounding, right,

801
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,299
is equal to the change in

802
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,220
the entropy of the
control volume,

803
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,459
plus the change in

804
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:16,650
the entropy of
the surrounding.

805
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,199
So what you're going to do

806
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,759
is you're going to
analyze, right,

807
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,559
the change in the
entropy of the water,

808
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:22,719
and then the change in

809
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:24,080
the entropy of
the surrounding,

810
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,559
just like we did
before, okay?

811
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,159
And the formula
you're going to

812
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:29,039
use for it is this, right?

813
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,359
The work transfer
process is

814
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:32,439
internally reversible,
no entropy change.

815
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:34,359
So the change in
entropy is only

816
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,959
dQ divided by T

817
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,719
because it's an
isothermal process,

818
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,319
that T comes out of
the integral, right?

819
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,000
So that's just going
to be Q by T, right?

820
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,679
And essentially, it's
the same, right?

821
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,200
And the T is going to
be the temperature

822
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,280
of the water, which
doesn't change.

823
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,399
And then the other one
is going to be the

824
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,679
temperature of
the surroundings.

825
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:49,839
Which? What
assumption do you

826
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,079
think you're going to
make the surroundings?

827
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,599
So I'm going to

828
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,840
transfer heat into
the surrounding.

829
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,199
What do you think

830
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:54,329
you're going to
treat it as?

831
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,579
Thermal reservoir,
you like

832
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:58,139
life being easy,
and me too, right?

833
00:31:58,139 --> 00:31:59,219
So you're going
to transfer in it

834
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:00,380
and it's going to
be a reservoir.

835
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,939
So isothermal
water, right?

836
00:32:01,939 --> 00:32:03,139
Constant temperature and

837
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:04,940
thermal reservoir,
constant temperature.

838
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
It's going to
be like a cue

839
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,099
by minus a cube by.

840
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,379
Is it where you're headed.

841
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:10,819
All right. So we've
dealt with this.

842
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:12,900
So we said, Okay,
Delta system,

843
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,899
I know from this on

844
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:20,100
my way to determining
my entropy generation.

845
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,139
Along the way to
determining that,

846
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:25,340
we can first determine
our Delta as water,

847
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,299
which is actually
what we need

848
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:28,744
in part A, okay?

849
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:31,829
All right. And so this,

850
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:33,189
we can write it explicitly

851
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:34,310
as, right, the integral,

852
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,029
and it's going to be
the integral from state

853
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:39,110
one to two of dq,

854
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,709
right, divided by T of

855
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,110
our let's say W for water.

856
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,189
And then this is going
to be the integral

857
00:32:47,189 --> 00:32:49,549
1-2 of

858
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:55,989
dq divided by T of our
surrounding, okay?

859
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:06,149
All right. So again,
our Delta system.

860
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,720
All right, the
temperatures

861
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,690
you can take out
of the integral.

862
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,049
Both of them are
constant, right?

863
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:16,570
The water is constant
because it's

864
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,210
only part of the
water condenses.

865
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,050
That's code for the
quality changes,

866
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,170
but I'm still saturated,

867
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,770
so constant temperature.

868
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,249
All right? And
so that's going

869
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:26,529
to end up being a Q.

870
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:31,409
So we have a Q
water, right,

871
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,490
divided by a temperature
of the water,

872
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,649
and that heat is being
transferred out.

873
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,449
So what sign
should this have?

874
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:43,449
So, you know, if I call

875
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:47,289
this QW out now
for the water,

876
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:48,969
what sign would you
put here to indicate

877
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:51,004
that entropy is
decreasing in the water?

878
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:52,839
Negative. Negative, right?

879
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,639
That's a negative
you put there.

880
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:58,960
Okay. And that'll
be plus the Q

881
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:08,359
surrounding in divided
by the T surrounding.

882
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,879
And because heat's
being transferred

883
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,239
into that, and this is in,

884
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,559
this is going to
be a positive, and

885
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,695
that'll indicate
entropy is increasing.

886
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:16,709
Now, I said before I

887
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,869
didn't need to do the
energy analysis of it,

888
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:20,469
but the nice part about

889
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,710
taking those two
control volumes,

890
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,749
drawing them big enough so

891
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:26,549
that it's
adiabatic, right?

892
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:27,749
So if I basically
draw that

893
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:28,949
surrounding one
large enough,

894
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:32,189
there's no heat in and
no work into it, okay?

895
00:34:32,189 --> 00:34:34,229
There's no heat and
there's no work into

896
00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:37,270
the combined
control volume,

897
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,709
just like with the hot
iron and the water.

898
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:41,549
And so what that
means is that

899
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,670
there's no change in
the internal energy.

900
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,829
The net result
from the first law

901
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:48,789
is that Q of

902
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:57,119
water out is equal to
Q of surroundings in.

903
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,079
That's the other
trick. Again, going

904
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,519
on that previous
example is by,

905
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:00,759
you know,

906
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:01,200
drawing

907
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,039
that other control
volume large enough.

908
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,880
Adiabatic, no
work transfer,

909
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,839
no change,
right, no change

910
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,359
in the internal
energy of that.

911
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,560
So the heat that's

912
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,919
transferred out of
the water must be

913
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,560
equal to the
heat transferred

914
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,799
into the
surroundings, right?

915
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:18,000
But you're smart,
so I didn't

916
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,759
need to do all
that, right?

917
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,999
And we did it before.

918
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:23,199
Okay. Yeah, so the
overall, like I said,

919
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,199
so this is your right,

920
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,999
this is the change
in the system.

921
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:31,959
We know it's given
us 600 kilojoules.

922
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,559
That's 100 degrees Celsius

923
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,399
converted into
Kelvin, okay?

924
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,560
So 373.5.

925
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,120
The Qn is again
600 kilojoules,

926
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,399
and the surrounding is

927
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:47,479
about three is 25 Celsius

928
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,639
than in Kelvin, right?
So that's done.

929
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,279
All right, let's come back

930
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:53,599
to our formula,
though, right?

931
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,919
So the other right,

932
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,479
when we did our
analysis of

933
00:35:57,479 --> 00:36:01,480
Delta S system for
the control volume,

934
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,439
that was equal to S in

935
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:09,080
capital S in minus
capital out plus

936
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:16,879
capital G. If
we look here,

937
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:18,879
and this is for
now, right?

938
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:21,999
This is for the

939
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:23,839
combined control
volumes, right?

940
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,599
So this Delta S system is

941
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,360
the green area plus

942
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,599
the boundary area
plus the water.

943
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,479
Is there any entropy

944
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,759
being transferred into
the combined system?

945
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,159
No. Is there any entropy

946
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,599
leaving the
combined system?

947
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,239
No. So the change
in the entropy of

948
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,959
the system then is nothing

949
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:46,759
for this adiabatic case.

950
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,719
The change in the
entropy of the system is

951
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,120
equal to the
entropy generated,

952
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,199
which is then our
part B, okay?

953
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,199
So Part A was essentially

954
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,959
determined this,
which we've done.

955
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:04,040
Part B was determined

956
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,839
this Which which
we've done.

957
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,479
All right. And part
C is what then?

958
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:19,799
What formula do we
write then for Part C?

959
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,790
Next. I times.

960
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:37,109
Yeah, so RX destroyed
X, X destroyed here.

961
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:40,429
I could write a
lot destroyed

962
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:45,110
is equal to Gen,

963
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,309
which in our case is the

964
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:47,349
change in the entropy of

965
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,869
the combined system
times T zero,

966
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:51,710
which is the dead
state temperature.

967
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,629
T zero here is equal to

968
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:58,989
T surrounding.
And that's it.

969
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:00,829
So my numbers, so

970
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:01,909
the change in the entropy

971
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:03,629
that I had for water,

972
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:14,239
um So Delta S
of water there.

973
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:20,120
Where did I put? Delta
S of water is equal

974
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:27,359
to -1.61 kilojoules
per Kelvin.

975
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,119
The Delta S of the system,

976
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,320
which includes
the reduction

977
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,439
of the entropy
of the water,

978
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,159
but the increase
in the entropy

979
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,399
of the surroundings
is equal to

980
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:45,200
0.40 kilojoules
per Kelvin,

981
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,239
and then our Xrogy
destroyed I have equal to

982
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:59,239
120.6 kilo joules. Okay?

983
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,079
So this part was not

984
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,079
actually in the
exercise in the book.

985
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,679
These can be
validated against it.

986
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,239
And again, the way
that I've shown this

987
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,519
is complimentary
to the way

988
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,399
the book has done it,

989
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:15,879
but I think actually is

990
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:16,959
a more correct way to do

991
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,479
it based on how we've been

992
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:19,960
set up before
with breaking

993
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,679
this into those two parts.

994
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,759
Namely, the reduction of

995
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,559
the entropy in one
part that's cooled and

996
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,879
the increase of
the entropy of

997
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:28,559
the part that's heated.
Are there questions?

998
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,199
Good? Seriously?
All right.

999
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:40,329
Yeah, and again, I think

1000
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:41,729
the key insight is
to really break

1001
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:42,969
it down into two and then

1002
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:44,729
treat them as
one, alright?

1003
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:48,379
Okay, um, Yeah,
so in general,

1004
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:49,659
if you encounter a new

1005
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:50,939
source of energy,
you know,

1006
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:53,499
maybe some new you go

1007
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:54,819
up the Berkeley
Lab and you

1008
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:56,459
find something weird
and warm up there,

1009
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:57,739
you know, you want to

1010
00:39:57,739 --> 00:39:58,939
know what the work
potential is.

1011
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,819
How much energy
could you extract

1012
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:03,419
that is useful from it?

1013
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:06,099
The answer to that
question is exergy.

1014
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:07,419
It is also
sometimes called

1015
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:08,739
availability, right?

1016
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,099
There's different
names for it,

1017
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:11,619
but it's a
longstanding goal.

1018
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,820
So Gibbs, when Gibbs
was doing thermo,

1019
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,859
this was one of his
goals was to figure out

1020
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:17,019
what's the maximum work

1021
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,179
I can get out, all right?

1022
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:19,979
He didn't call it exergy.

1023
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:23,019
Or available energy
is another term.

1024
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:25,809
Um, This is not

1025
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:28,569
like the properties
we've done so far.

1026
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:30,689
So if you want to define,

1027
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:33,449
let's think about
work, right?

1028
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:34,889
If I wanted to
define work,

1029
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:36,530
right, that was
a path function.

1030
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,329
What does that mean? I
have an initial state.

1031
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:39,889
I have a final state, but

1032
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:42,009
that's not enough
to specify it.

1033
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:43,289
There's a path to it.

1034
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:45,209
I could have
reversible paths.

1035
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,809
I could have irreversible
paths, okay?

1036
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:49,849
And depending on the
path that I take,

1037
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,370
I'm going to get
different amounts

1038
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,889
of work out of
it, all right?

1039
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:57,150
Um, Yeah, so in analysis,

1040
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,709
what we do is we specify
the initial state.

1041
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,829
And that's not a variable.

1042
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:04,949
So that's
basically a given.

1043
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:08,269
And the work output

1044
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,389
is maximized when

1045
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:10,509
everything is
done reversibly.

1046
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,109
It's kind of an obvious
statement, right?

1047
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:13,150
I do everything perfectly,

1048
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,029
and that's the best.

1049
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:15,389
You know, not exactly like

1050
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,189
Berkeley you
know, you know,

1051
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:18,829
you know, Berkeley
studentn't get that,

1052
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:19,949
like, you know,
essentially,

1053
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:20,509
but that's the idea.

1054
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:21,909
So you maximize it
when everything is

1055
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:23,749
done in a reversible way.

1056
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:25,150
And the system must

1057
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:30,629
go to a dead state, right?

1058
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:33,179
So if I think about
potentials, You know,

1059
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:34,299
if you think about
like, you know,

1060
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:35,939
what would be, you know,

1061
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:37,739
the maximum, you know,

1062
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:39,179
work out of a turbine,

1063
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:40,339
it's when the
pressure difference

1064
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:41,939
across it is
highest, okay?

1065
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:43,659
What makes it a high
pressure, right?

1066
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:46,339
I just put a ton of
heat into the thing.

1067
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:47,779
I make it really
high pressure.

1068
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:49,979
What makes it have
a low pressure,

1069
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,179
you make it cold.

1070
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,379
And that's what
you do, right?

1071
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,379
You take river water or
you think, you know,

1072
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,579
lake water or
whatever, and you

1073
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,899
run them through
the condensers.

1074
00:41:56,899 --> 00:41:58,220
That's how you ensure

1075
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,699
that the steam
is condensed and

1076
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:01,019
kept cold and

1077
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,340
basically the
lowest pressure

1078
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,219
that can be done.

1079
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,059
And you can't really go

1080
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:05,099
below the dead
state, right?

1081
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,649
You're rejecting
heat you know,

1082
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,249
in those examples of

1083
00:42:08,249 --> 00:42:09,329
the rivers and the lakes

1084
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:10,369
and that or the oceans,

1085
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,529
right, you're
rejecting that into

1086
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,130
the park that's the
lowest temperature,

1087
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:13,329
right?

1088
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,409
And that's your
your dead state,

1089
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:18,089
a right Okay.

1090
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:21,429
Um, And so what
is a dead state?

1091
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:22,909
I mean, in a
sense, you know,

1092
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:23,709
it's like trying to

1093
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,029
define what is dead, okay?

1094
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:26,909
So, like, a dead state

1095
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:29,629
here is if you look
at your surroundings,

1096
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:30,669
the way that I think of

1097
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:31,989
it is like equilibrium.

1098
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:33,309
If I let everything,
you know,

1099
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:34,909
in here kind of come
to equilibrium,

1100
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:35,590
and then I measure

1101
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,829
the temperature,
the pressure,

1102
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:37,990
and the specific volume,

1103
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,709
those would be the
dead state, right?

1104
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:41,989
So the dead state
in Berkeley is

1105
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,189
different from
the dead state in

1106
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:44,549
Chicago right
now, for example.

1107
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:46,069
I'm getting pictures
from my in laws.

1108
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:47,469
It's cold, you
know? It's like,

1109
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,049
so there it's
different, right?

1110
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:51,429
But, you know,
for your system,

1111
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:53,189
that's essentially it.

1112
00:42:53,189 --> 00:42:55,469
In general, for
oxygen analysis,

1113
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:56,709
and for the
purposes of this

1114
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:57,829
class, your dead states,

1115
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:59,389
unless it's
otherwise stated,

1116
00:42:59,389 --> 00:43:03,229
25 Celsius in 1
atmosphere, right?

1117
00:43:03,229 --> 00:43:05,429
And the system will have

1118
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:08,989
no X org when it's
reached that state.

1119
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:12,069
So along the process
in your system,

1120
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:13,829
if you measure your
temperature or

1121
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:14,749
pressure and you're at

1122
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:15,789
that state, you are dead.

1123
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:17,229
You are at the dead
state. There is

1124
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:18,669
no difference in
a Delta T, right?

1125
00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:20,389
So heat transfer,
there is no difference

1126
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,309
in pressure to drive
a turbine, right?

1127
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:26,029
That's the idea. Okay.

1128
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,429
So what does that mean?

1129
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:30,949
So just like when

1130
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:32,749
we did the
analysis today for

1131
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:35,189
the steady flow system

1132
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:38,189
that was open and for
the closed system,

1133
00:43:38,189 --> 00:43:38,789
right,

1134
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:41,069
we write write things

1135
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:42,030
a little bit differently.

1136
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,909
The energy for

1137
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:45,509
a closed system
looks like this.

1138
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:48,269
So what is it? It
is internal energy,

1139
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:49,669
okay? I'll start
with this, right?

1140
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,205
So we have
internal energy.

1141
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:53,659
You have specific volume,

1142
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:55,339
and you have the
entropy, right?

1143
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:59,019
And let's say velocity
in potential energy,

1144
00:43:59,019 --> 00:43:59,779
but these we really

1145
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:01,179
don't deal with too often,

1146
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,460
you have internal energy,

1147
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,539
specific volume,
and entropy

1148
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:05,859
at some state, right?

1149
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:08,299
And what you're
driving towards,

1150
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:10,339
is a dead state.

1151
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:12,859
So these are
all subtracted

1152
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:16,859
by their counterparts
at the dead state.

1153
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,299
So you have the
internal energy at,

1154
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:18,779
let's say,

1155
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:21,659
25 Celsius in 1 atmosphere,
specific volume.

1156
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,819
At 25 Celsius
1 atmosphere,

1157
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:25,619
the pressure there,
the temperature there,

1158
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,099
and the specific entropy.

1159
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,219
And let's say if there's

1160
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:29,619
a dead state velocity,

1161
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:31,889
whatever that
means, you know,

1162
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:33,929
think maybe zero, okay?

1163
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:36,290
Or a dead state at height.

1164
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,689
Again, maybe the ground.

1165
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:41,969
All right, in that, okay?

1166
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:43,729
So we'll work
more with it.

1167
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:45,689
I know I'm killing
you with, like,

1168
00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:48,129
introducing new things,
but it'll make sense.

1169
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:50,009
We'll do some examples,
and I promise.

1170
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:51,329
And if it doesn't
make sense,

1171
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:52,409
then don't do it this way.

1172
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:55,029
Just do entropy
generation. All right.

1173
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:56,909
For an open system, again,

1174
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:59,629
just like when we went
from closed to open,

1175
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:01,109
instead of dealing with

1176
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:02,669
internal energy, right,

1177
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:04,669
we went to enthalpy
because we wanted to

1178
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:05,749
take we wanted our

1179
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:07,269
work term to
be shaft work,

1180
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:08,829
and so we put the
flow work in.

1181
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:10,709
It's the same thing.
So the energy then

1182
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:13,349
is for a flow system.

1183
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:15,309
So the flow can
possess an energy.

1184
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:17,829
That's the enthalpy
at that state,

1185
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:19,510
the entropy and
the velocity

1186
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,429
and let's say the height,

1187
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:23,469
and then it's minus
its dead state parts.

1188
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:24,969
This is pretty useful.

1189
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:27,589
So this formula is
used then, you know,

1190
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:29,109
I'll do an
example next time

1191
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:30,749
and data center analysis,

1192
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:31,509
how you do, like

1193
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,349
an exergetic analysis
of that there.

1194
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:34,630
But the flow Eergey

1195
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,189
in this way is
actually something

1196
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:37,949
that is used and we'll

1197
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:41,109
use we'll use a
lot next time.

1198
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:43,239
Okay.

1199
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:45,279
Now, all right.

1200
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:47,560
So that's kind of
just definition.

1201
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,399
I said before
that one point

1202
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:51,799
of Extra G is
to be able to

1203
00:45:51,799 --> 00:45:54,079
rank heat and work to

1204
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,360
compare apples to apples

1205
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,559
when it comes to
heat and work.

1206
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,919
The way that
you make heat,

1207
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:00,559
you convert heat transfer

1208
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:02,359
into Extra G is
the following.

1209
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,959
I take Q, and
I times it by

1210
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:06,679
this one minus T
over T. What does

1211
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:07,959
a one minus T over T

1212
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:10,439
remind you of
in this class?

1213
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,109
In efficiency.
What efficiency?

1214
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:17,189
Who said it? Name?

1215
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:21,069
Ad. Yes. It looks a
lot like Carn, okay?

1216
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,949
And that's the whole
point of Carnal,

1217
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,989
right? Karal was, right?

1218
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:29,269
Work out divided by
heat in is equal to

1219
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:32,189
one minus the
cold temperature

1220
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,749
divided by the
hot temperature.

1221
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,669
All I've done here is
I've said, essentially,

1222
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,629
let's say maximum
reversible work

1223
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,550
is equal to the heat,

1224
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,909
let's say
transferred in times

1225
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:44,749
one minus the
cold temperature,

1226
00:46:44,749 --> 00:46:45,964
which is what?

1227
00:46:45,964 --> 00:46:48,579
Dead state divided by

1228
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:50,179
the temperature from which

1229
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,579
it's coming, all right?

1230
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:53,899
And this is how
you rank heat.

1231
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:56,739
You think like Carne and
I can now with this,

1232
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,179
I can say, Hey,
now I'm able to

1233
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:00,259
compare apples to
apples with it.

1234
00:47:00,259 --> 00:47:02,779
You think about something
like the sun, okay?

1235
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:06,059
The sun is very hot
with like 5,800 Kelvin.

1236
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:08,019
This would be an
approximate formula

1237
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,259
for the sun. Don't
get me started.

1238
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,939
But the point is that,
you know, you know,

1239
00:47:11,939 --> 00:47:13,259
even 300, you know,

1240
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:16,739
divided by 5,000 is a
small number, right?

1241
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:18,139
So for transferring heat

1242
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:19,944
from the sun,
that's, like,

1243
00:47:19,944 --> 00:47:22,464
a very high
quality of heat,

1244
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,179
right, it has a
very high energy.

1245
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:25,664
It has very high
work potential

1246
00:47:25,664 --> 00:47:27,539
associated with it, right?

1247
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:28,865
Sadly, at the moment,

1248
00:47:28,865 --> 00:47:30,345
we waste a lot
of it, right?

1249
00:47:30,345 --> 00:47:31,819
So, but that's it.

1250
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:33,584
So this is how
we're able to

1251
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,144
rank make him there.

1252
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,299
If we look at it, so
if you were to say,

1253
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:39,984
and we'll do this,
we'll talk about,

1254
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:40,699
you know, we'll have

1255
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:41,979
some steady
flow of system.

1256
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:43,699
We'll have some heat

1257
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:45,499
and work and
mass coming in.

1258
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:47,464
That overall
will constitute

1259
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:48,624
an energy, right,

1260
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,749
a rate of energy
transferred in,

1261
00:47:50,749 --> 00:47:52,720
there will be some
energy that's

1262
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,759
transferred out
in the form

1263
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:54,880
of heat work in mass.

1264
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,679
A lot of times
maybe it's heat in,

1265
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,279
heat and mass that are in,

1266
00:47:58,279 --> 00:47:59,839
and a bit of heat out

1267
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,559
and hopefully a
lot of workout.

1268
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,159
And in that process, if

1269
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:06,399
we have irreversibilities,

1270
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,079
there will be
energy destruction.

1271
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,319
And the point is from an

1272
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,559
optimization
point of view,

1273
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,199
that's something you
would like to minimize.

1274
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:13,320
You'd like to minimize

1275
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,844
the destruction of that.

1276
00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:17,769
Okay, so, inevitably,

1277
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,089
the question that
will come up to me,

1278
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:20,609
is this on the quiz?

1279
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,489
It is not. However, I
will say two things.

1280
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:25,489
The first is that
it's on the homework.

1281
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:26,889
Yes, and there
will be maybe

1282
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:28,529
more of it in
Module three,

1283
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:31,489
because I love this
stuff, and it's useful.

1284
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:33,609
For the thermodynamic
project,

1285
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:35,209
because this is a
modern analysis,

1286
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:36,329
this may prove useful.

1287
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:37,209
If you're interested in

1288
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:38,809
more sophisticated things,

1289
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:42,169
you know, it
can be helpful.

1290
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,249
If this is
something you want

1291
00:48:43,249 --> 00:48:44,449
to go into into
the future,

1292
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:45,489
if energy and that type

1293
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,809
of stuff something
you want to do,

1294
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:48,539
learn it. Like, learn it.

1295
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:49,579
I have a lot of
notes and stuff.

1296
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:51,259
I teach energy
conversion principles.

1297
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:51,699
Let's use

1298
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:53,260
the data center
class next semester.

1299
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,379
We'll be using
things like this

1300
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:55,779
in that class.

1301
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,819
It'll tell you things
like waste heat.

1302
00:48:57,819 --> 00:48:59,459
So if a process and
to produce heat.

1303
00:48:59,459 --> 00:48:59,979
Literally,

1304
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:00,659
all of the problems we

1305
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:01,459
have today is that we have

1306
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:03,859
data centers that are
giant toasters, okay?

1307
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:05,579
They're great and
making toast,

1308
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:06,779
but they also make
things warm, and

1309
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:08,179
we don't do anything
with that heat.

1310
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,739
If you do extrogen
analysis,

1311
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,499
you can assign an
economic value,

1312
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:13,340
not just like,
Hey, it's useful,

1313
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,340
but you can do conversions

1314
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,379
based on the
temperature of

1315
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:16,419
your heat and
turn that into

1316
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:17,939
dollars and then go
to someone and say,

1317
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:19,219
like, you should do this.

1318
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:22,034
This is sensible,
okay? And make money.

1319
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:24,489
Get a job and
make money, okay?

1320
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:26,049
Yeah, so we'll get into

1321
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:27,209
this. There are a
lot of examples.

1322
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:28,609
You can read about
these things again.

1323
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:29,649
I can talk about it.

1324
00:49:29,649 --> 00:49:30,769
You can read it there,

1325
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:31,809
but it's not just this.

1326
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:32,929
So with that, you can

1327
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:34,369
define exergy destruction.

1328
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:35,769
You can say
what exergy is.

1329
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:37,089
I'm going to
close it. I have

1330
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:38,369
got like 1 minute up
here for questions,

1331
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:39,969
and then I got to go
get my wife, okay?

1332
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:42,169
Thank you. Have
a great weekend.
