1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,960
Okay, I got 210, so
I will get started.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,080
So what I have
here, right,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,720
is this example we left
off with last time,

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,640
where we took
a hot piece of

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,120
iron and dropped it
into a cold bath.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,639
What we know from
this process

7
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:20,160
is that it's an adiabatic

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,879
adiabatic basically from

9
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,239
the overall
system, all right?

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,599
It's a no work exchange

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,320
because it's
incompressible

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,359
between CV one and

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,160
CV two in the
surroundings.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,879
We represent that
by saying, right,

15
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:34,959
that the change in
the internal energy

16
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,759
of this combined system

17
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,159
is no heat, no
work, right?

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,679
So that's zero, okay?

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,559
Um, We know the
initial states, right?

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,119
We know the rock
to start with,

21
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,279
you know, the
water, right?

22
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,519
And so what we're
looking for

23
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,399
is the final temperature
that's there, right?

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,039
So what we did is, at

25
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,239
the end of the
last lecture,

26
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,720
right, the change in
the internal energy

27
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,839
of control volume one,

28
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:57,400
which I'm representing
with pink

29
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,559
here is the mass
of the iron,

30
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,839
the specific heat of

31
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:04,680
the iron times the
final temperature,

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,480
which we don't know minus

33
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,839
the initial
temperature, okay?

34
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:09,159
And we're going to
come up with a similar

35
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,799
expression for the water.

36
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,639
We're going to substitute

37
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:14,719
both those
formulas together,

38
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,439
and then we're going to

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,919
solve for T two, okay?

40
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:19,299
Um, Yes.

41
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:24,099
Okay. So for the
water baths,

42
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,019
and now we're basically
dealing with CV two.

43
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:31,259
So for control volume
to the water bath,

44
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,259
we know from
incompressible fluids that

45
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,379
the specific heat Cp is

46
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:40,179
equal to CV is
equal to C, right?

47
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:44,380
So it's it's a constant.

48
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,620
And so changes in
internal energy.

49
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,979
Random writing
little U here,

50
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,219
so jules per
kilogram is equal

51
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,739
to CV which is

52
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,819
a function of temperature
times dt, right?

53
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,739
This is just a
definition that we have.

54
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:00,579
If we integrate
through here and if we

55
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,579
treat the specific heat

56
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:04,779
as being constant over the

57
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:06,540
temperature range
that we're studying,

58
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,099
which is basically
valid for

59
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,179
most of the problems,

60
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,700
right, that we
work with, right?

61
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,020
We can pull that out of
the integral, right?

62
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,020
And we'll call
it dt, right?

63
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,100
And so in this case,

64
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,420
if we have that, you know,

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,900
Delta U, it is then equal

66
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,169
to, approximate
symbol, approximate.

67
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,689
So basically approximately
equal to some CV.

68
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,090
Let's call it,
you know, for

69
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,010
the now maybe average.

70
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,250
And then we can
times that by T

71
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,970
two minus T one, right?

72
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,130
And we did this
for the rock.

73
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,769
What I said is
in the tables.

74
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,569
So if you go to the
tables and you look

75
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,489
up what you have
for the iron.

76
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,090
So, not the rock,
the iron, right,

77
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,340
is there's 11 value
of CP, right?

78
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,460
Basically, one value of

79
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,820
the specific heat
that's there.

80
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,899
For water, you have
other ones, right, zero,

81
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,340
25, 50, 75 and 100.

82
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,340
My recommendation,
especially when

83
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,900
getting started in these
problems and working

84
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,820
on it for now
is just to pick

85
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,780
the value that's at

86
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,180
room temperature unless

87
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,340
you're told
otherwise, right?

88
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,220
So all I'm going to

89
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,460
say is that basically this

90
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,174
is for the case of
water, right, CV,

91
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:25,290
at T equals to
25 degrees C,

92
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,650
which because of
that, it's CP,

93
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,290
and there it's what, 4.1,

94
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,810
4.18 kilojoules per
kilogram Kelvin.

95
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,210
All right? I mean, it's

96
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,490
very detailed,
but, you know,

97
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,930
I want to be explicit
with this, all right?

98
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,930
Is that clear
for all or no?

99
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:55,335
Great. Um Yeah.

100
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,255
And so then right

101
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,574
if we want to
turn this into

102
00:03:57,574 --> 00:04:01,179
the right Delta U,
which is what we want.

103
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:04,410
Right? So the
big Delta U of

104
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,215
CV two is then

105
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,459
equal to the mass
of the water.

106
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,809
So mh2o times CV,

107
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:18,615
h2o times T two, the
final temperature,

108
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:19,299
which we don't know

109
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:20,735
minus the initial
temperature,

110
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:24,454
t1h 20, right?

111
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:29,214
Okay, so if I call this
as if I call this is,

112
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:31,380
let's call it
equation one, right?

113
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,819
If I call this basically
as equation two,

114
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:37,419
and if I call this
as equation three,

115
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,059
I combine two and three.

116
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:43,139
If I combine two
and three into one,

117
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,739
what we're going
to have is

118
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,620
the mass of the iron.

119
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,579
So M of F,

120
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,574
CV of F. I'm writing F

121
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:58,220
as the um uh the
symbol for iron,

122
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,219
T two minus T one,

123
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:02,679
comma F E, and then

124
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,160
that's going to be plus
this formula here.

125
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,000
So that's going to
be plus h2o, CV,

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,159
h2o times T two,

127
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:16,759
the final
temperature minus

128
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,679
the initial
temperature T one,

129
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:22,440
H two oh, and that's
all equal to zero.

130
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,509
All right. Maybe a kid.

131
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,109
And all you do is

132
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:34,349
you basically
rearrange them.

133
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:35,550
So if we rearrange

134
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,829
four and we
solve for T two,

135
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,069
what we're going
to have then is T

136
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:39,589
two is equal

137
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,630
to the mass of the iron CV

138
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,989
of the iron T one of

139
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:54,825
the iron plus the
mass of water h2o.

140
00:05:54,825 --> 00:06:02,019
CV, h2o, and t1h 20,

141
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,020
and all that's essentially

142
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,580
divided by the CVs.

143
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,820
Then we're going
to have M of iron,

144
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:16,259
CV of iron plus
the mass of h2o,

145
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,539
and then the CV
of h2o, okay?

146
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,189
Yeah, and if I substitute
the value, right?

147
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,949
So we're given the

148
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:29,509
masses are given
in the problem.

149
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,189
The initial
temperatures are,

150
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:35,270
let's see, given in the
problem in Celsius.

151
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,869
That's perfectly fine here

152
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:38,669
because we're going
to expect a value

153
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,869
that's going to be
intermediate 80-25, right?

154
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,949
So you could see maybe
these initial factors

155
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,589
as kind of like
waiting factors for

156
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:51,950
which ones are going
to um end up at.

157
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,389
So we know the mass,

158
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,189
the CVs, we know

159
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,750
the mass, we know
the temperatures.

160
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,909
The CVs I just showed you,

161
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,949
CVs are CPs for
these cases.

162
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:06,310
So that's your water,
and that's your iron.

163
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,749
So you substitute that

164
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:08,830
in, and then it's
the same here.

165
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,390
You have the M's and
the C's with it.

166
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,189
If you substitute
those values,

167
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:19,929
what I have is a T
two that is 58 Oh,

168
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,169
I'm sorry, Geez,
I'm reading wrong.

169
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:28,409
25.6 degrees Celsius as

170
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:31,209
my final
temperature, okay?

171
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:35,049
And I can analyze this
and say Gee whiz,

172
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,210
that's not a huge
temperature increase.

173
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,609
That's like 0.6.

174
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:41,129
Calvin, but what you
have to recognize is

175
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,929
that the drawing here

176
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,129
is obviously not to scale.

177
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,289
There's an order of
magnitude more water

178
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,049
there by mass than

179
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:50,490
there is essentially
of iron.

180
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,010
That's that's half
a ton of water

181
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:03,170
and only 50 kilogram
then of iron?

182
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,649
Yes, please. When you

183
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,220
put the C for iron
at eight degrees.

184
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,549
You don't get so
in this case,

185
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:14,669
in this class, there
is no such thing.

186
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,069
Right? So there
is this value.

187
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,790
That's what's
in the table.

188
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,190
If you wanted to be
that sophisticated,

189
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,109
you could go up
and look at it.

190
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,229
What I would tell
you, though, and

191
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:23,669
this is what I
introduced earlier,

192
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,149
is if you want
to look up like

193
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,389
specific heats and how

194
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,470
they depend upon
temperature,

195
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,469
let's call this roughly
like I don't know,

196
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,469
100 Kelvin that's here.

197
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,590
You'll see kind of
a big drop off,

198
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,710
and then kind of,
you know, you do it.

199
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,749
So basically, by some
critical temperature,

200
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,150
you've already
activated most of

201
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,030
the modes of energy
storage in the material.

202
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,150
And so when you go
to really high ones,

203
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,670
you don't see that
much of a gain, right?

204
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,189
So water's a nice example.

205
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:58,070
So 25-100, you go
from 4.18 to 4.22.

206
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,109
So that's less
than 1% change

207
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:03,710
in the specific
heat, okay?

208
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,470
But if you get to,

209
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,789
like, temperature
differences that

210
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:07,950
are maybe like 1,000
Kelvin, right,

211
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,230
then maybe that tiny
amount that you have

212
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,789
there becomes relevant
for your calculations.

213
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:16,470
Okay? But fair question.
Other questions?

214
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,829
How might you do
this differently?

215
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,070
You had a very good
point last lecture,

216
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,270
if you cared to share.

217
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,670
Yeah.

218
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,850
Yes. Exactly.

219
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,889
So instead of writing

220
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:41,490
our conservation of

221
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,890
energy equation
in this way,

222
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,850
or we could write
it in this way.

223
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,569
The way you could
look at it is that

224
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:49,410
the change in the
internal energy of

225
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,970
the water has to equal

226
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,409
the change in
internal energy

227
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,330
of the iron, right?

228
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,410
Which is to say
that the heat

229
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,890
that I transfer
into the water

230
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,250
has to be equal
to the heat that

231
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,809
leaves that's transferred

232
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,370
out of the iron, right?

233
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,450
And for me, that's

234
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,810
a more intuitive
way to do it,

235
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,930
especially later on when

236
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,289
we get into heat
exchangers.

237
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:09,770
That's a much more
intuitive way,

238
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,330
but I'm just
following, you know,

239
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,090
basically, I'm following
the book here.

240
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,930
And also this framework of

241
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,209
kind of this
additive approach

242
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,249
into changes
internal energy

243
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:23,090
for control volumes
is a good one, right?

244
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,329
So the GSI, I
think Cassidy

245
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:26,650
worked through a
problem with a room

246
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,210
and a radiator and a fan,

247
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,929
and there it's very
helpful to visualize,

248
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,830
break it down into
the different parts.

249
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,649
Analyze, right from
your initial to

250
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:35,570
your final states and

251
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,770
then just start
adding things up.

252
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,810
And just like in
that problem,

253
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,650
I'm pretty sure it was

254
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,770
an adiabatic no work

255
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,450
transfer process
at the end of

256
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,530
it with the goal

257
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,890
basically to fight
T two, all right?

258
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,250
Wonderful. Okay,
so if there are

259
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,770
no other questions,

260
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,900
Okay.

261
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,220
Great. So today,
essentially,

262
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,740
we're going to go

263
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,099
through some
conservation principles,

264
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:20,779
and then at the end,

265
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,700
we're going to finish
with turbines,

266
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,340
right? There's
a bit of math.

267
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,860
You know, we're
going over a very

268
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,580
important is a very
important stage,

269
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,420
right, in the class
when we get into

270
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,220
what are called
steady flow devices.

271
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,979
But this is
rockets, nozzles,

272
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,260
diffusers, turbines.

273
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,900
Basically, everything
that goes fast

274
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,780
is and how we produce

275
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,780
the energy is based on

276
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,220
this analysis, all right?

277
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,739
Okay, so we've
done conservation.

278
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:49,819
Of energy. That's
the first principle.

279
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,899
In your courses
and later on,

280
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,380
you basically have
two other ones that

281
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,820
you'll deal with
conservation of

282
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,300
mass and conservation
of energy we've done.

283
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,340
Mass, now we're
going to do.

284
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,919
The last one is momentum.

285
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,480
When you take
M one oh six,

286
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,080
you're going to de a lot
with conservation of

287
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,839
mass and conservation
of momentum.

288
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,560
In this class, we only
do conservation of

289
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,880
energy and conservation
of mass with it.

290
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,960
Okay, what I want
you to look at here,

291
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,400
what I'm defining
essentially here is, again,

292
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,240
one of my, um, uh,
control volumes.

293
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,519
So I have, let's say,

294
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,960
um, you know,
I don't know,

295
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,079
I define some type of,

296
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,520
uh, uh, you know,

297
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,320
wonky looking,
um, you know,

298
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,719
basically control
volume here, right?

299
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:40,520
This is the interface
and basically maybe

300
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,530
at this interface,
Um, right?

301
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,650
I have a vector which
is normal, right?

302
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,689
So I have a vector

303
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,090
that's normal
at that point,

304
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,490
right, which I can define.

305
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,729
That's possible. Have
you ever read Gauss,

306
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,569
you know, beautiful
stuff from him.

307
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,170
If I take any
surface, right?

308
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,050
I can take a point.

309
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,250
I can define the
curvature at that point,

310
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,090
and I can define
a vector that's

311
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,255
normal away from it, okay?

312
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:03,140
We have that.

313
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,780
So this is basically
like let's say

314
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,540
a normal vector, one, two,

315
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,339
let's say at this point,

316
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,380
I have the following,

317
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,180
you know, velocity, right?

318
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,340
So let's say that I
have a fluid velocity,

319
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,060
V, I'll denote it
as a vector with

320
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,780
the arrow over it, okay?

321
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,339
The first step in all of

322
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,600
this, would be right?

323
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,080
To essentially, right,

324
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,760
to do the analysis
at this point,

325
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,280
what we actually
need to know

326
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,799
is the velocity,

327
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,120
right, of, let's say,

328
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,480
this fluid in

329
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,880
the normal direction
to this, right?

330
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,960
So, essentially, we do
a projection, right,

331
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,100
of this velocity
here into um,

332
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,620
onto the normal direction,

333
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,420
right, which we
can then call as,

334
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
let's say, V bar,

335
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,740
N, N denoting,
uh, the normal.

336
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,460
And I'm putting an
arrow above this,

337
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,700
at least for the
moment so I don't

338
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,859
confuse you with volume.

339
00:13:57,859 --> 00:13:59,699
Again, I have
26 characters,

340
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:00,979
a couple of Greek letters,

341
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:03,740
but that's where we're
we're at, right?

342
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,020
And I represent
this, you know,

343
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,179
here in the plot again.

344
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:06,940
If you want to go through,

345
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,579
you can run through

346
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,709
that code and
see it, right?

347
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:13,319
Okay, that's the mathy
part of it, right?

348
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,759
In reality, the
way that we

349
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,440
deal with this is we don't

350
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,560
draw boundaries
in a weird way

351
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,559
where we need to
do math, right?

352
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,359
We're engineers.

353
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,160
We're efficient.

354
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,480
Okay? If you want
torture yourself,

355
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,479
you can get down the
road there, right?

356
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,480
So in this case, what I'm

357
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,555
showing you is a
classic problem,

358
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:32,030
and a classic problem
of a pipe flow, okay?

359
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,470
And I'm going to draw
the boundary such as

360
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,150
this velocity that I see

361
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,030
here matches Vn, right?

362
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,470
So basically, I'm
going to draw

363
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,390
this in this
way, all right?

364
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,190
How do I do that?

365
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,350
The first thing
to know is to

366
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,190
describe for you what

367
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,869
a velocity looks
like in a pipe flow.

368
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,230
There's a fascinating
history to

369
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,830
this Poisll was
looking at this,

370
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,710
like flow in your blood
in your veins and,

371
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,630
like, how that goes.

372
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,550
And it turns out, right,

373
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,030
there's two
important well,

374
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,190
basically,
there's, like, one

375
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,590
very important
thing in fluids.

376
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,590
Thermo, we draw a
boundary in fluids,

377
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,910
there's no slip
at the wall.

378
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,310
There is no slip, okay?

379
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,120
So Here, I have no
slip. Okay, one.

380
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,080
I have some flow that
I'm bringing in.

381
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,279
I have no slip there.

382
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,359
What it basically means is

383
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,560
that I'm going
to assume that

384
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,879
I'm going to end
up with a maximum

385
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,319
velocity at the middle,

386
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:19,519
and probably to a
good approximation,

387
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,160
actually maybe
analytically correct,

388
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,080
you're going
to end up with

389
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,919
a parabolic flow
profile, right?

390
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,384
So again, this is
All right, maximum,

391
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,219
the way we represent

392
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,344
these velocities at
these different points

393
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:30,710
is we draw arrows

394
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,830
that look like
this, all right?

395
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,985
Okay. But this
is my right?

396
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:37,225
This is my boundary.

397
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,025
And I've drawn
this, right?

398
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,665
It turns out
maybe I'm a bit

399
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,265
lucky in the way that
I've drawn it here,

400
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,545
it turns out that all
those velocity vectors,

401
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:46,380
the magnitude or
the direction of

402
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,864
those velocity
vectors also

403
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,505
lies on the normal, right?

404
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:52,265
The plane that's normal or

405
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,905
the line that's normal
to that plane, okay?

406
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:56,785
Again, if you
want to plot it,

407
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,625
you can see it
see it there.

408
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:03,290
Okay. Um great. All right?

409
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,330
Ooh. All right.

410
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:11,170
Where should I go
with this, right?

411
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,330
So maybe it's better if I

412
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,090
keep up before I get
into this, right?

413
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,290
So we can talk

414
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,889
about so this is
like velocities,

415
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,690
but actually what
we care about is

416
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,850
not necessarily
velocity all the time.

417
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,250
We care a lot about
mass flow rates, okay?

418
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,090
So we can take this and

419
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,050
this velocity, and
by knowing, right,

420
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,330
the density of
the fluid or

421
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,570
specific volume
of the fluid,

422
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,169
I can turn this into
mass fluorides.

423
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:33,569
That's a conserved
principle.

424
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,450
There is no conservation
of volume, okay?

425
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,329
You get into that.

426
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,409
You think about
a compressor.

427
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:38,929
I have a low
specific volume

428
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:39,970
going into a compressor,

429
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,610
a high one,
leaving it Like,

430
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,490
if you go with
conservation of volume,

431
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,250
you're out of job.
Okay? All right.

432
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,810
So we can write a
differential of

433
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,650
the mass flow rate,
generally, right?

434
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,170
Delta, again, I'm going to

435
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,049
go with inexact
differentials.

436
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,570
Delta M dot, M dot,

437
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,890
meaning that, you know,

438
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,490
like the Newton
notation, right?

439
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,970
So dm dt is equal
to M dot, right?

440
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,729
So this is what

441
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:06,289
Leibnitz, that's
Neton, right?

442
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:07,930
So we're going with
Newton notation

443
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,489
here in M dot is

444
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:13,130
equal to the inverse
of specific volume.

445
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:19,209
The magnitude of the
velocity normal, right?

446
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,209
So basically, the
normal velocity

447
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,730
and the cross

448
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,250
sectional the
differential then of

449
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,889
the cross sectional area
that's that's there.

450
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,370
And again, we
chose this plane

451
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,929
intelligently so
that, you know,

452
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,209
this matches that
and we don't

453
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,889
have to do any
kind of cosines

454
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:41,379
or projections. All right.

455
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:42,819
If we go with

456
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,379
that formula that I
had there, right?

457
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:45,539
So what I can say is that

458
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,019
the magnitude then of

459
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:48,659
this normal
velocity is then

460
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,979
equal to some V max, okay?

461
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:52,340
So value that's here.

462
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,700
It doesn't really concern
us for this class.

463
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,699
And then this would be

464
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,259
one minus little R, right?

465
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:00,539
Divided by big R, right?

466
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,219
So this would be,
right, big R,

467
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:04,659
and then little R is

468
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,539
just a coordinate, right?

469
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,169
In the pipe, okay?
So when I have,

470
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,689
R equals little R

471
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,249
equals zero,
write a maximum,

472
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:20,289
when I have little
R equal to big R,

473
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:21,449
this is zero,
and that's how

474
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:23,370
you produce that profile.

475
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,050
All right. So if we
do a substitution

476
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,689
into this and we
integrate, okay?

477
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,129
So if I go write

478
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:31,009
an integral and DM
dot, all right?

479
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,250
So I'm going to
basically be doing

480
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,849
a double integral because

481
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:37,530
it's an area of
specific volume,

482
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,490
the magnitude of
the normal velocity

483
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,439
R the DR or P,

484
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,359
right, is like this

485
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,759
is polar
coordinates, right?

486
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,479
I could like wrote, you
know, look into the

487
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:51,439
um if I had basically
looking down the pipe,

488
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,959
this is my R, right?

489
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,999
This would be
your Phi, right?

490
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:58,160
So you assume it's
an axymmetric,

491
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,639
you know, problem, okay?

492
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,000
So we don't have
any sort of

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,879
dependence on the
P that's in here.

494
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,999
So these integral limits
will be like zero to

495
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:09,319
two Pi and then
zero to R, right?

496
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,679
So basically zero to R,

497
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,359
and then zero to two Pi in

498
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,599
terms of of the
radian, right?

499
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,999
Okay. So the
first one, right,

500
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,080
the first integral because

501
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,079
we don't have
any Phi in here,

502
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,039
this is going to be
two Pi minus zero.

503
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,360
So you'll end up
with a two Pi.

504
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,020
And then the other one
is that, um, right?

505
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,059
We're going to
end up here.

506
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,059
Well, let's just
write it out.

507
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:36,259
Basically, you're
going to have here

508
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:39,779
an m.in this case,

509
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,900
right, which is going
to then be equal to

510
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,219
two Pi V max, right?

511
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,660
V max is a constant.

512
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,659
So we should basically

513
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:50,059
substitute this
formula into here,

514
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,700
and we integrate
into two Pi.

515
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,220
So you have two Pi V max

516
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,180
divided by
specific volume.

517
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,739
There's an integral
zero to R of R

518
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,579
minus R squared
divided by R,

519
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,894
okay, and D R, right?

520
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:08,529
You can go through and you

521
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:09,850
integrate again with this,

522
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,770
and what you're
going to end

523
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,770
up with is an M dot

524
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,250
that's equal to
Pi times V max,

525
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,849
right, your
maximum velocity R

526
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,769
squared divided by

527
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:21,729
three times the
specific volume, okay?

528
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:31,769
Cool. All right, um do.

529
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,969
Yeah, in a pipe, so

530
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:37,209
basically in a pipe,
we know that AC,

531
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:38,489
so the cross sectional

532
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:39,769
area is going
to be equal to

533
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:43,850
Pi R is equal
to Pi squared.

534
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,209
And so if with
this knowledge,

535
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:47,930
so I go with Pi R squared,

536
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,609
I can rewrite then
my dot as being

537
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:54,449
equal to a row.

538
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,810
So, let's go with this.
Let's go with AC.

539
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,009
Pi squared V max,

540
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:04,199
and then this is
divided by three V.

541
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,469
Again, because this is
going to come up and

542
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:07,309
sometimes you might see it

543
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,470
in a fluids context,

544
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,829
right, the density
is equal to

545
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:12,710
the inverse of
specific volume.

546
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,109
And so what this will
look like then is

547
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:19,309
times AC times V max

548
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:24,974
divided by basically
divided by three, okay?

549
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:27,319
Um, at the end of this,

550
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,000
this will all make

551
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,159
sense why we
bother, right?

552
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,639
It turns out this V
max divided by three.

553
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,919
You can do the math
and go through

554
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,400
with the definition of
the average velocity,

555
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,159
but it turns out

556
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,479
this is basically
going to be

557
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:45,759
the average velocity
in the pipe, right?

558
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,280
And so this is
by definition,

559
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,319
equal to one
over AC, right?

560
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,520
So the integral over

561
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,599
the cross sectional
area, right?

562
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,759
The normal vector,
the magnitude of

563
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,599
the normal vector
to the plane there.

564
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,099
And then this is dC.

565
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:03,919
I'll spare you, but

566
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,439
if you go through my
notes there and see,

567
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,199
what you would see at

568
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,119
the end of this
is that the

569
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,400
max or that the
average velocity is

570
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,160
basically going to
be equal to V max

571
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,759
divided by three there,

572
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,199
okay? So, who cares?

573
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,999
The who cares
is that, again,

574
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:20,879
when we think about

575
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:23,799
control volumes
and we draw them,

576
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,920
we draw them
intelligently.

577
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,039
When they cross through

578
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,199
something like
a pipe, right?

579
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:30,600
This should be done,
right, essentially

580
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,960
perpendicular to the flow,

581
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,239
right, that you have
there. That's one.

582
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,119
The second thing is

583
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,479
that for most
of this course,

584
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:39,120
I think probably
the entirety,

585
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,839
we're going to give
you velocity values,

586
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,440
and these are going
to indicate averages.

587
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,880
So if you see a
pipe that says

588
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,559
100 meters a
second, you know,

589
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,919
into a nozzle there,

590
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,800
it means that it's
the average velocity

591
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,099
into the nozzle, okay?

592
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,760
And I'm telling
you with math

593
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,240
and knowledge and physics,

594
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,679
you could go back and
show that, right?

595
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,239
If I had detailed
knowledge about

596
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,559
the flow profile and
what's there, I could,

597
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,279
you know, come up
with this average,

598
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,640
and that's ME one oh six,

599
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,279
not this class, okay?

600
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,600
All right. Any
comments about that?

601
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,149
All right. Cool.
All right.

602
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,349
So there we go. So again,

603
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,429
average velocities are
what we care about,

604
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:19,230
and we draw control
volumes intelligently.

605
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,550
The conservation of mass

606
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,949
principle is written
like this, right?

607
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:23,310
So we have a
control volume.

608
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,429
The net change in the mass

609
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:25,789
in the control volume is

610
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,190
equal to how much

611
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,189
enters it minus how
much it leaves it.

612
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:30,429
That's the same thing
that we did, right?

613
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:32,750
This is accounting fluid

614
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,629
mechanics accounting,

615
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:36,549
right? It's
written like this.

616
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,149
So in non rate form in

617
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,454
minus M out is Delta MCV.

618
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,479
We will, again,
a lot of this,

619
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,920
we'll be writing
it in rate form.

620
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,959
We're going to talk
about dot ins minus

621
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:51,320
M dot outs are
equal to dm, cv dt.

622
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,199
I'm noting here the
units in this case,

623
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:58,199
again, in Leibniz and
in Newton notation.

624
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:08,069
All right. Okay. Yes.

625
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,509
You can take
everything that

626
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:12,590
I've written
and done here,

627
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,870
I did it for a pipe flow,

628
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,949
but you could go
and do it for,

629
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:20,230
and develop an
MDOT formula

630
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,349
for something that's
leaving or entering.

631
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:23,829
That would end up
being something

632
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,949
that's on the
right hand side,

633
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,190
and that would be equal

634
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,709
to the rate of change
of what's actually

635
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:30,749
inside of the control
volume, okay?

636
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:32,789
So I'm going to
spare you know,

637
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:34,350
having to go through that.

638
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,919
But again, this is
nothing but, uh, right?

639
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:38,959
Essentially, this
formula that I'm writing

640
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,359
here and done
more generally.

641
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,919
And here, row in
this case is, again,

642
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,559
the density, V here,

643
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,799
dv here does not
have a vector.

644
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,679
This is indicating
the volume, right?

645
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,560
So essentially the density

646
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,480
the rate of change
of the density

647
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,319
times the change in the
volume is then equal

648
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,679
to the change in

649
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,560
the mass in the
control volume.

650
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,644
Okay.

651
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:04,570
All right. Another
thing that's

652
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,690
going to come up
a lot is you're

653
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,530
going to have things
sometimes cases

654
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,009
where multiple streams

655
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,209
are coming into a
control volume and maybe

656
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:15,089
leaving as one or
vice versa, okay?

657
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:17,250
This is called a
mixing chamber.

658
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,330
You know, we're
going to have

659
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,329
systems that we do it.

660
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:20,769
What do you need
to know is that

661
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,569
when these are
steady processes,

662
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:24,089
so again, what was

663
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,729
the formula that we
had here, right?

664
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:31,729
We said that dm
CV dt is equal to

665
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:39,249
dm in dt minus
dM out dt, okay?

666
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:42,319
Um a steady process in

667
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,679
this case does not mean

668
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,639
that all of them
go away, okay?

669
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:48,040
That technically is a
steady process, right?

670
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,399
But the system is
dead, okay, right?

671
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,799
If nothing's coming
in, nothing's

672
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,399
leaving, obviously
nothing's changing.

673
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:55,520
Steady in this
case here means

674
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,399
that this term
is out, okay?

675
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:02,080
So it's like I have

676
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,200
the same amount leaving

677
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,519
as I have entering, okay?

678
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,439
That's what's
steady for, right?

679
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,840
So, MD basically MDOT

680
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,854
in is equal to
your MDT out.

681
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:16,190
All right. And that's
what's shown here,

682
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,509
right, in this
case, right?

683
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,830
So I have some 2
kilograms/second

684
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,749
in, 3 kilograms/second in.

685
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:23,030
What must be leaving under

686
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,509
steady conditions, right,

687
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:26,070
is then that
two plus three

688
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,669
must be equal to the
five, all right?

689
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,170
And, I mean, turbines,

690
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,729
diffusers, nozzles, again,

691
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:33,769
a lot of what
we're going to

692
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:35,329
analyze are going to have,

693
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:37,169
I would say 90%

694
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,569
of what we analyze
is going to be this.

695
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:40,809
There's very few cases.

696
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,009
They are important cases,

697
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,689
but there's a few
cases where you have,

698
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,209
like what we call unsteady

699
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,530
flow where essentially,

700
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,810
let's say you
have more leaving

701
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,249
than you have
entering, okay?

702
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:51,369
I won't make the accounting
joke about that,

703
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:51,809
alright?

704
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:53,849
Fine. So that's
one part of it.

705
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:55,089
The second thing
is that there is

706
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:56,370
no, as I mentioned before,

707
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,849
there is no
conservation of

708
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,309
volume, uh,
principle, okay?

709
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,430
And the case that
I give here,

710
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,189
like I mentioned before,

711
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:03,909
is this air
compressor case.

712
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:06,069
I have 2
kilograms/second in,

713
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:07,949
2 kilograms/second
out, right?

714
00:27:07,949 --> 00:27:10,910
So that's steady according
to my definition.

715
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,389
But because the density

716
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:16,190
in here or the
specific volume here

717
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,629
is much higher than the
specific volume here,

718
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:23,909
the denser phase, you're
going to end up with

719
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,190
a lower volumetric
flow rate

720
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,269
leaving than what
enters, okay?

721
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:32,149
So M dots,
conservation of mass,

722
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:33,429
conservation
of energy, not

723
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:35,910
conservation of
volume, right?

724
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,570
Yeah. And you can play
fast with the rules.

725
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,730
If you do something
that's incompressible,

726
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,649
let's say like
water, go ahead.

727
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,089
How does this make
sense to play you?

728
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
I don't understand
the question.

729
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,119
Say it again.

730
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,640
Because you said the air

731
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,120
leaving the system faster

732
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,319
than it's entering it.

733
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,959
So I'm saying the mass is

734
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,960
entering at the same rate

735
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,079
that it's leaving, right?

736
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,920
The mass. So just
follow with me.

737
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,359
So let's say we
accept that.

738
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,400
You also accept that

739
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,319
when you compress
something,

740
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,120
is the density
higher or lower?

741
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,920
Is the specific volume
higher or lower?

742
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,800
Lower. Specific volume

743
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,080
times the mass flow rate,

744
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,839
the product of that is

745
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,640
the volumetric flow rate.

746
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,120
So it is lower.

747
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,440
The big compressor
industry

748
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,920
has been lying
to you, alright?

749
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,520
Okay. Other comments
about this?

750
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,399
Okay, so that's sweet.

751
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,639
You got EE one

752
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:44,359
oh six your setup to
succeed on, alright?

753
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:44,880
Alright.

754
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,799
So, now we're going
to use this, alright?

755
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,119
So I'm going to
go through Oh,

756
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,159
boy, I don't like that.

757
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,719
Why is that cut
off like that?

758
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:58,559
Okay. Um Okay.

759
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,959
Apologies. I'm
not sure why

760
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:04,639
my Can I do this
in two present?

761
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,919
Of course not. Okay, so

762
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,359
here there

763
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,919
were basically we're
talking about,

764
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,159
you know, one inlet,
one outlet here.

765
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:16,919
What I would like
to go through in

766
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,159
this example is to go

767
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,799
into multiple
streams, okay?

768
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,239
And at the end of this,

769
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,439
I'm going to show you why

770
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,680
you care about enthalpy,

771
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,160
why you're going
to use enthalpy

772
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,200
for all analysis of

773
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,839
all steady flow
devices and

774
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,400
not changes in
internal energy

775
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,039
like we've done, right?

776
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,719
So enthalpy is where
we're going with this,

777
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,400
like a very meaningful

778
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,759
use of enthalpy, right?

779
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,599
Um, So let's say I have

780
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,039
a control volume
here that I

781
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,920
draw with my dashed lines,

782
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,559
and I have these
dots that are in,

783
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,119
and so N number
of M dots in

784
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,839
and K number of dots out.

785
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,080
Eganga means inlet,

786
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,360
Aus Ganga means
exit, apologies.

787
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,040
So we have M dot.

788
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,120
Our general mass
balance is going to be

789
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,440
the rate of change of mass

790
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,720
in the control volume.

791
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,159
Ms of T is going to be
equal to the sum of

792
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,799
those dots in minus

793
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,319
the sum of the M dots out?

794
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,199
When we have a
steady balance,

795
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:13,240
the rate that
the mass enters

796
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,955
is equal to the rate
that it leaves.

797
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:18,549
Okay, so that's what
the mass, right?

798
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:19,829
Now we can go and do the

799
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:21,269
energy balance, all right?

800
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:25,830
The thing is that fluids
also carry energy.

801
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,309
Remember before we do

802
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:28,629
a control volume,
and I said,

803
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,109
In this control volume,

804
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:31,630
when I don't have
mass exchange,

805
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,429
what are the ways I can

806
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:34,549
transfer energy
in and out?

807
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,429
Louder. I'm like,
getting I don't know.

808
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:38,990
Maybe there's, like,
a thing in my ear.

809
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,570
Okay. How can I

810
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,530
transfer energy in and
out of control volume?

811
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,089
Work Or heat. That's it.

812
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:49,289
Okay?

813
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:50,090
What I'm telling you

814
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,650
is when you have
an open system,

815
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,970
you can also carry

816
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,369
energy in with
mass, right?

817
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:55,529
Mass, if I move it really

818
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,009
quick carries kinetic
energy, right?

819
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:58,210
There can be
kinetic energy.

820
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,129
Mass that I bring from
very high, right?

821
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,570
There's potential energy

822
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,969
that could be
brought into it,

823
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:04,409
and a fluid also

824
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,489
contains internal
energy, right?

825
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,809
It's mass, okay?

826
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:10,930
So, um, the
rate of change.

827
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,689
So let's say the difference
in the energy in

828
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:14,849
this control volume at

829
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:16,889
some future time
minus now is

830
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:18,690
equal to the net
heat we transfer

831
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,209
in minus the network

832
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:25,249
we transfer out plus
an additional term,

833
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:27,970
which is the mass

834
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,009
the change in
the mass that

835
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:32,050
enters with its
little energy.

836
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,490
I'll get into
that in a second,

837
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,009
minus the change in

838
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,610
mass times the
energy content

839
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,289
that it has leaving, okay?

840
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:41,530
So we have basically
two new terms,

841
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,649
and it has to do with
the flow energy there,

842
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:47,489
okay? What is little E?

843
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,609
So little E, right?

844
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,809
We already did
this in the first,

845
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,050
right in the first
parts of the lecture.

846
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,769
We said, Look,
when we deal

847
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:01,489
with systems here, right?

848
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:02,810
We don't want to
talk about all

849
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,969
the kinds of
energy, right?

850
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:05,130
You know, you
have magnetic,

851
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,569
right, you got all
kinds of stuff.

852
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:08,009
For in thermal,
we just said,

853
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,489
like, look, we want
to deal, right?

854
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:11,839
So changes, right? We had,

855
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,919
like, changes in,
um, you know,

856
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,799
Delta E CV, right,

857
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,119
is equal to E in
minus the E out.

858
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,680
And the way that we
said that energy

859
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,000
could change in the
control volume,

860
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,240
right, was this Delta
U plus the Delta KE,

861
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,719
plus the, um, uh,
Delta P. We said,

862
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,400
these are the three
types of energy changes

863
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,719
we're interested in
in this class, okay?

864
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,680
And we said, Look,

865
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,600
with the internal energy
for pure substances,

866
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,240
it depends on,

867
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,640
like, temperature
and pressure,

868
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,919
pressure and
specific volume,

869
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,719
they say two things.

870
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:42,079
Okay? This depends on how

871
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,840
high you are and
how fast you are.

872
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,400
You know, are you
using bolt or,

873
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,159
you know, a
skydiver, right?

874
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,059
Um, Okay,

875
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:51,619
it's no different with
the fluids, right?

876
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:54,179
A fluid can possess
internal energy, right?

877
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,419
It can be hot, it
can be cold, right?

878
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:58,659
It can possess
kinetic energy.

879
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,260
It can have a speed
to it, a velocity,

880
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,939
nozzles, very
important nozzles,

881
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,339
right, rockets
and all of that.

882
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:05,379
And it can possess
potential energy, right?

883
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:07,299
If it's very high, think
pump hydro, right?

884
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,740
Switzerland where
I was before,

885
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,979
the country's blessed with

886
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:10,899
mountains and all of this,

887
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:12,499
but also a lot of
mountain lakes.

888
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:13,780
And so they used
to store a ton

889
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,500
of energy with hydro,

890
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,819
pump it up, bring
it back down.

891
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:18,979
It's a beautiful way
to store energy.

892
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:20,899
So those are like the
three ways, again,

893
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,019
in this class that we're
going to talk about

894
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:26,939
the energy of a
flowing fluid, okay?

895
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:28,700
That's literally, right?

896
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,740
And again, because
it's a little letter,

897
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,060
it indicates
that it's energy

898
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,699
per mass, right?

899
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:35,779
Okay, so you can

900
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,499
go from this form
that I have here.

901
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:38,739
So if we divide basically

902
00:33:38,739 --> 00:33:40,579
both sides here
by Delta T,

903
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:44,299
so some small time,
increment, right?

904
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:45,659
We can turn each
of these things

905
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:46,819
into a rate form, right?

906
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:48,139
So the change in
the energy of

907
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:50,739
the control volume
can be E dot, right?

908
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:52,659
The the change in

909
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,619
heat transfer can
be Q dot, right,

910
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:57,900
w dot, and so on
and so forth,

911
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,409
including also, the
mass flow rates, right?

912
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:02,959
And so that's what
we write here.

913
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,759
So basically, this
form of the formula is

914
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,080
the conservation of energy

915
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,520
for control volume,

916
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,519
where I can bring
heat in or out,

917
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,999
work in or out, or a
fluid in or out, okay?

918
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:15,919
So here, okay?

919
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,079
So the Q dot, right?

920
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,399
This could be
essentially like

921
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,040
heat loss through
a housing.

922
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,199
But the W dot, I
want to pause for

923
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,679
a second because this is

924
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,999
a little bit
complicated, all right?

925
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:28,159
This W dot, right?

926
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,079
When we were dealing with

927
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,639
these systems
and the pistons,

928
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,159
what were ways that we

929
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,679
were dealing with work?

930
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,879
Let's say, what
were types of

931
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,399
work transfer
processes that

932
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,279
we could do with,

933
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,640
like, a piston cylinder?

934
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,049
Name and what?

935
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,250
Yes. Okay. That's
wonderful.

936
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,890
What's another type
of work interaction?

937
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,130
Yeah. That's also PDV.

938
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,289
So I can do that and that.

939
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:01,809
That's good.

940
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:04,490
Okay. Yes, please,
Force distance.

941
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,889
Force distance of

942
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:07,049
similar to him.
Yes, please.

943
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:09,989
Name. Ryan electric work.

944
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:11,910
Yes, right? I can
transfer electrically.

945
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,149
That was the other
way we did it, okay?

946
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:14,629
What I'm telling you here

947
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:17,509
is that when you
bring a fluid in,

948
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:19,029
right, you may have to

949
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:21,269
displace a fluid
out, okay?

950
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:22,149
That makes sense.

951
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:23,589
Kind of like a
plunger effect,

952
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:24,749
a piston, a little bit

953
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:25,909
like the boundary
work before.

954
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:27,029
You may have to push it.

955
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:28,749
And that is
called flow work.

956
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:30,390
And you don't give a shit

957
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,909
as an engineer
about flow work.

958
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:33,549
That's a penalty
for you, okay?

959
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,429
So you want to
get flow work

960
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:37,709
out of this W dot, okay?

961
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:38,870
If you want a job with GE,

962
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,869
I saw Nviden front,

963
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:40,990
you want to go
work for GE.

964
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,429
This w dot cannot be
w dot of everything.

965
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:44,989
You want to get flow
work out of it.

966
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:45,949
And I'm going
to show you how

967
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,294
to get rid of that, okay?

968
00:35:47,294 --> 00:35:50,359
Um, so let's imagine
this experiment, okay?

969
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:51,479
So again, let's
say we have

970
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:54,840
this bladder looking
control volume,

971
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,799
all right? All right?

972
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:58,959
So you got let's
say a fictitious,

973
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,879
an imaginary
piston, and it has

974
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,119
some cross sectional area

975
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,199
to it, A, all right?

976
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,439
The fluid at
this point has

977
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:06,680
a density or the inverse
specific volume,

978
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,399
and it has a
pressure, all right?

979
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,759
And let's say that there's

980
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:10,919
one stream that
it can leave.

981
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,079
And now we push that
piston a little bit.

982
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,359
So we do that
displacement.

983
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:16,079
So what was
mentioned before,

984
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,759
we displaced that
piston a little bit.

985
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,519
So some of delta little S,

986
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,720
so that's a distance
that it's moved.

987
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,079
The cross sectional area

988
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:25,359
times that Delta
S is a Delta V,

989
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,094
a volume change, okay?

990
00:36:27,094 --> 00:36:30,389
P dv, right, in
a sense, right?

991
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,589
So the work you
have there is

992
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,430
that pressure there times

993
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,670
that displacement
in volume.

994
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,029
And we can write
it as rate form.

995
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,109
It can be w dot is
the pressure times

996
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:42,310
the cross sectional area
times the velocity.

997
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,829
And again, just
because I've

998
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,549
got too many Vs
that are here,

999
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:47,909
I'm going to go with
the German one vindiki

1000
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:49,910
W. We do W for velocity.

1001
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,549
PAW there is then

1002
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:54,629
the rate of flow work

1003
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,564
that's being
transferred in, right?

1004
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,259
And then we do
it to the exit.

1005
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,980
We're going to have a
density of the exit,

1006
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,620
a pressure at the exit,

1007
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,019
a surface that's a
cross sectional area.

1008
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,820
We have an area
at the exit,

1009
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,419
and then we can expand it.

1010
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:13,900
We can expand that
some distance.

1011
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,819
Again, that delta S times

1012
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:16,939
that cross sectional area

1013
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:20,339
becomes a displacement
volume, pdv.

1014
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,539
That's the work or

1015
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,579
we can have the
rate of it.

1016
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:25,779
PA times the velocity
that the fluid moves.

1017
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:29,859
So flow work, okay?

1018
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,519
So the total work, so that

1019
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,799
W dot that I showed you

1020
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:36,280
before in the
conservation of energy,

1021
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,599
right, that consists
of useful work.

1022
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,119
All right, what
we would call

1023
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,799
shaft work or what we

1024
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,479
formerly just called,
like boundary work.

1025
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,399
You know, basically,
that's useful work

1026
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:48,480
plus the rate of
flow work leaving

1027
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,919
the system minus
the rate of

1028
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:54,319
flow work that's entering
into that, okay?

1029
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:57,039
And the formula
that's the best way I

1030
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,680
have the total rate
of work transferred

1031
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,999
out of the system
is equal to

1032
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,750
the useful work plus

1033
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,709
the dot specific volume of

1034
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:09,230
the fluid stream leaving

1035
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,750
minus M dot PV of
the one entering.

1036
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,349
And the thing you
should see with this

1037
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:15,229
is that we have
a P, right?

1038
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:16,710
So the pressure times

1039
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,229
the specific volume
that's there, right?

1040
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:21,589
And if you
remember enthalpy,

1041
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:23,430
what's enthalpy?

1042
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,990
It's H. Yes. Thank
you. Like my kids.

1043
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,069
Yeah. So they're right
in the funniest ways.

1044
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:43,049
Okay, U plus PV,
right? P there.

1045
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:45,169
And so, essentially what

1046
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,289
we're going to do
is we're going to

1047
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:47,530
take that flow
work portion.

1048
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,809
We're going to
combine it with

1049
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,570
the internal energy
of that flow stream,

1050
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,009
and we're going to
form enthalpy there.

1051
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:53,209
So the enthalpy, right?

1052
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:53,809
The whole point of

1053
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,409
the enthalpy is you're
basically taking

1054
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:58,649
flow work out of the
total work term.

1055
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:01,409
So all that's left is
useful work, okay?

1056
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:02,809
That's what I'm
doing here, right?

1057
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,889
So this is kind of
a mess, but right,

1058
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,130
the rate of
change of energy

1059
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,249
in the system is
the rate that we

1060
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:08,650
transfer heat in minus

1061
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,129
the rate of work
leaving, right?

1062
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:12,009
That is shaft
work, flow work

1063
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:13,730
leaving, flow
work entering,

1064
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,049
plus the sum of

1065
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:16,569
the mass entering times

1066
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:17,769
the energy stream there,

1067
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:19,290
minus the mass leaving

1068
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,889
times its energy
stream, okay?

1069
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:22,809
And if you put
this whole term

1070
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:24,210
into the W dot,

1071
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,170
and I take the PV terms,

1072
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,809
and I combine
them here, right?

1073
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:29,649
So now I've got rate of
change of energy and

1074
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:30,849
my control volume is he

1075
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,009
leaving work shaft work,

1076
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:35,409
useful work
transferred out

1077
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,730
plus all of
that U plus PV,

1078
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,530
which is enthalpy,
kinetic energy

1079
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,409
and potential
energy, okay?

1080
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:44,889
So we take, right,

1081
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:46,609
the flow work out
of the total work,

1082
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:48,489
and then we form enthalpy

1083
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:50,769
in the fluid
stream, right?

1084
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:52,609
And that's a
more natural way

1085
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,209
to introduce
enthalpy, right?

1086
00:39:54,209 --> 00:39:55,449
This is actually
the way you should

1087
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:56,809
introduce enthalpy

1088
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:59,770
is actually through
this analysis,

1089
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,969
because it has a lot
of utility, right,

1090
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,969
much more than the
other one, okay?

1091
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:07,319
Um, Yes.

1092
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,360
So if you want to
compare and contrast,

1093
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,639
so here's the
conservation of

1094
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,599
energy when we do
the enthalpy form.

1095
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,839
So we have the
useful work,

1096
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,519
right? Notation with that.

1097
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,079
If you go with
the notation of

1098
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,999
internal energy
in the flow term,

1099
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:22,719
this w dot is the
overall work, okay?

1100
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:25,679
So, um, you know,

1101
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,439
so I can show

1102
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:28,919
an example because I
got a bit of time.

1103
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:30,279
I'll show you an
example of how it is.

1104
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:31,799
So let's think about
a turbine, right?

1105
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:34,674
So I have a turbine, um,

1106
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:37,030
And we can apply

1107
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,229
this conservation of
mass and which we

1108
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,989
introduced today and
the conservation

1109
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:44,629
of energy principle
for an open system,

1110
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:46,150
which we have
today, alright?

1111
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:55,949
Okay. All right.

1112
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,070
So what does it look
like a turbine?

1113
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,309
You have a star
and a rotter

1114
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:03,149
A rotter rotates,
a star stays.

1115
00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:05,509
You start off with a
very compressed region.

1116
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:07,549
So the smallest part of
the turbine is where

1117
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,789
you're most compressed,
and then it expands.

1118
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:10,829
So at some schools,

1119
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:12,269
that's like a question
they ask on the final.

1120
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,590
They take you the
show a turbine

1121
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,949
and they say, what's
the front and the back?

1122
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:16,189
And then some
people don't know.

1123
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:17,869
So you start off
very, very compressed

1124
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:18,549
and you leave it's

1125
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:19,789
the opposite of
a compressor.

1126
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:21,309
A compressor, you
would start off

1127
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:23,105
highly expanded and
you get smaller.

1128
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,259
So we have the inlet,
we have the outlet.

1129
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,699
And what we're
interested in

1130
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:27,899
the turbine is the rate

1131
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:29,339
of work that's
transferred out,

1132
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:30,859
and that we call
shaft work,

1133
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:32,780
spinning the
shaft that spins,

1134
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,419
there's a force
associated with that.

1135
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:35,859
It can move through
a distance.

1136
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:38,059
A lot of times you're
just spinning right

1137
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:40,299
a generator producing
electricity from this,

1138
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:42,679
but shaft work is what
you want to know.

1139
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:45,619
P in kinetic energies are

1140
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:47,499
trivially kind of small

1141
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:48,859
compared to the changes in

1142
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:50,099
enthalpy that happen here.

1143
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,099
So Delta KE and Delta P

1144
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:54,419
are usually pretty small.

1145
00:41:54,419 --> 00:41:56,380
And then these things
are usually insulated,

1146
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,060
so we don't have
heat transfer.

1147
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,259
If it's poorly insulated,

1148
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:00,499
you may have heat
transfer out,

1149
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:02,139
but then you're
losing money, right?

1150
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:03,859
So the way to
analyze this is you

1151
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:05,659
write your conservation
of mass, right?

1152
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:08,740
Steady, um, under
steady conditions.

1153
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,300
So the rate that
mass enters

1154
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,980
equals the mass
that leaves.

1155
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,379
And then for the
conservation

1156
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:14,299
of energy, the same thing.

1157
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:14,979
There's no change in

1158
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:16,380
the energy to
control volume.

1159
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,699
It's adiabatic.

1160
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:20,740
There's no kinetic or
potential energy terms.

1161
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,539
And so all the w dot
S is is dot, right,

1162
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:25,619
because that's equal to

1163
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:26,740
the inlet and the outlet,

1164
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,099
times the enthalpy at

1165
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:30,885
the entrance minus the
enthalpy at the exit.

1166
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:32,469
Like, that's it.

1167
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:34,469
Like, it's so simple.

1168
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:35,869
You just get
these two states.

1169
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:36,949
All I need to know is the

1170
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:38,629
enthalpy and the MDT,

1171
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:39,989
and you can say
things like, that's

1172
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:43,229
a ten megawatt
turbine, okay? G.

1173
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:44,629
That must be the states

1174
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:45,749
that you need to
make that work.

1175
00:42:45,749 --> 00:42:49,820
Yes, please. Name?
Andy. Fluid.

1176
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:53,979
The thing is,
it has. It can

1177
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,099
come in with a velocity.

1178
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:57,819
It's going to leave
with a velocity.

1179
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,339
But when you go in
and you actually

1180
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:03,379
calculate in joules
how much that it is,

1181
00:43:03,379 --> 00:43:05,339
it's not really
comparable to

1182
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:06,019
the difference in

1183
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:07,659
the enthalpies
that are there.

1184
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:09,139
The square of
that velocity,

1185
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:10,139
if you now compare

1186
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:11,139
that with the
difference in

1187
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:12,499
the enthalpies
in these kinds

1188
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:13,879
of problems,
it's not there.

1189
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:15,259
One place where it can

1190
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,979
happen is when you
get into nozzles.

1191
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,819
So in nozzles, that's
the whole point, right?

1192
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:19,579
The whole point of

1193
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:21,339
a nozzle is that
I take a lot of

1194
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:24,219
enthropy to start and
I convert all of it,

1195
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,780
all of it into velocity.

1196
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,579
So you can design

1197
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:27,739
systems where
you make that,

1198
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:28,499
or you could design

1199
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:29,779
a system where
you want to,

1200
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:30,699
you know, take all of

1201
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:32,139
the enthropy
and convert it

1202
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:33,780
into potential energy.

1203
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,179
Like, these can be done.

1204
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:38,459
Yeah. Okay. But you
could double check.

1205
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:40,179
You could go in and put
some velocities in.

1206
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:41,259
Maybe that's homework, you

1207
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:42,459
know, next time,
come and tell me.

1208
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:46,299
Okay? Other questions
about this until now?

1209
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:47,739
Okay.

1210
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:49,859
Um Yes.

1211
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,539
So here you could go
through and do it.

1212
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:52,979
So this would be
some numbers.

1213
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,539
You know, for Andy,
he could go in

1214
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:56,179
and put 10
meters/second here,

1215
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:58,139
100 meters/second
here and say how

1216
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:00,339
different the
work would be.

1217
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:01,979
But if we neglect
kinetic and potential

1218
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:04,259
energy and we assume
it's adiabatic,

1219
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:05,540
that's going to
be the formula

1220
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,139
for the shaft work.

1221
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,139
And so all you need to

1222
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:09,379
determine is H
one and H two.

1223
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:10,980
So that whole part
about Pi killre,

1224
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,939
why do we care at all
about states, right?

1225
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:13,779
You know, I put in

1226
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:15,259
the two conditions
that I know.

1227
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:16,859
The other two
conditions that

1228
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,539
I know, dot
notation, right?

1229
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,219
I basically get the
enthalpy out of it.

1230
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:24,860
So here we have a
superheated steam,

1231
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,699
so high pressure, 6
megapascals, 400 degrees.

1232
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,499
See a good quality
steam coming in.

1233
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:33,139
Um, we're leaving as a,

1234
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,059
a saturated liquid
vapor condition,

1235
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:39,780
so 90% of vapor

1236
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,219
and much lower
pressure, okay?

1237
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:45,069
Um, And that's
good, right?

1238
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:46,309
We have a huge
difference between

1239
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,149
60 bar to 0.2 bars,

1240
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:49,989
you know, that's going
to produce a lot of

1241
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:52,069
work out of the system.

1242
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:53,069
But by knowing here

1243
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:54,190
the pressure and
the quality,

1244
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,949
you have complete
information

1245
00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:55,829
of the system, right?

1246
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:56,629
You're going to be able to

1247
00:44:56,629 --> 00:44:57,589
determine the enthalpy by

1248
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:00,109
the book tables or
Pi color there.

1249
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:01,629
That's how it's
represented on

1250
00:45:01,629 --> 00:45:03,549
a TV diagram, right?

1251
00:45:03,549 --> 00:45:04,909
So superheated out here.

1252
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,829
We're showing the isobar,

1253
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,429
and then we end
up under the dome

1254
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:12,189
here with the
saturated vapor. Okay.

1255
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:15,029
I just some
numbers with this.

1256
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:16,989
So if I have a bit
of time, I do.

1257
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:23,699
Um, So the numbers
that I have,

1258
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:26,619
maybe am I going
to be able to

1259
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:29,179
just show this or is it
going to look wonky?

1260
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:30,419
Okay, now it looks good.

1261
00:45:30,419 --> 00:45:32,699
I don't know
why. All right.

1262
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,539
Okay, so we have
here, right,

1263
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:41,089
for State one
State one Right?

1264
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:47,009
So we know P one is
equal to our 60 bar,

1265
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:52,249
T one is equal to
400 degrees C.

1266
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,609
With this, because it's in

1267
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:54,889
the superheated
region, right?

1268
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:57,329
I'm going to be able to
determine everything

1269
00:45:57,329 --> 00:45:58,809
including my enthalpy,

1270
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:00,529
my H one, right?

1271
00:46:00,529 --> 00:46:03,009
For my state two,

1272
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,509
Let's see if we
can turn H one,

1273
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:07,469
and we can determine also

1274
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:09,269
the specific
internal energy

1275
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,949
U one, right?

1276
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:15,429
For state two, of P two
is equal to 0.2 bar,

1277
00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:19,149
and the quality of the
vapor is equal to 0.9.

1278
00:46:19,149 --> 00:46:21,229
Again, from this,
I can know H two,

1279
00:46:21,229 --> 00:46:25,629
and I can also know
U two there, okay?

1280
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,230
And we set the dot shaft,

1281
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,589
so the useful work

1282
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:32,469
was equal to
the mass flowy,

1283
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:34,429
which is also given

1284
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:37,389
as 4,600 kilograms
an hour.

1285
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:39,029
All right, that's
going to be equal to H

1286
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:41,969
one minus H two.

1287
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,749
If we do the substitution,

1288
00:46:43,749 --> 00:46:45,149
what you're going
to end up with

1289
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:50,349
is a let me look at this.

1290
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,589
This is like that.

1291
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:56,309
That's a big value.

1292
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:57,309
So what I'm going to end

1293
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:58,989
up with here is one, zero,

1294
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:06,590
28, 102 8 megawatts.

1295
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,869
Basically, at
this case, that's

1296
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,109
that's a massive
power plant.

1297
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:15,269
It's like a gigawatt
of power plants.

1298
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:17,629
No, I'm sorry. Hold
on. Wait a second.

1299
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:19,149
I've multiplied
it in 10,000.

1300
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,709
If I put this in,
what you're going to

1301
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:23,429
end up with is

1302
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:30,749
a 1.03 megawatt
power plant.

1303
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:33,664
That's more
reasonable? Yes.

1304
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:35,859
Okay. So now the thing is,

1305
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:36,659
if now we want to

1306
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:37,779
compute the total
work, right?

1307
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:38,419
The total work.

1308
00:47:38,419 --> 00:47:39,739
So this is the
correct one, right?

1309
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:41,379
This is basically
what you want.

1310
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:43,299
But you can go
right with the

1311
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:48,219
w.net out to the w
dot total, right?

1312
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:53,579
That would be.u1
minus U two,

1313
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,419
okay, specific volume or

1314
00:47:55,419 --> 00:47:57,699
internal energy, specific
internal energy.

1315
00:47:57,699 --> 00:47:59,579
And if you substitute
and you have that,

1316
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:04,819
you're going to
end up with 0.841.

1317
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:08,539
Let's see, megawatt,
okay? And that's wrong.

1318
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:10,619
And that's not, like,
a little bit wrong.

1319
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,539
That's, like, wrong
by, like, a mile.

1320
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:16,334
I you know, there.

1321
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:20,614
So 1.0 megawatts versus
0.84 with it, okay?

1322
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:22,214
And so that's
why, you know,

1323
00:48:22,214 --> 00:48:23,530
we go through we

1324
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,329
extract the flow work
out of the work term.

1325
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:29,095
We put that then
into the U plus PV.

1326
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:30,655
We form enthalpy.

1327
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:34,489
And so, with all
of these systems,

1328
00:48:34,489 --> 00:48:36,414
the rate of work
transferred out,

1329
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,894
the rate of work
transferred in,

1330
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:38,769
the rate of heat out,

1331
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:40,734
the rate of heat
in is all going to

1332
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:43,934
become dot
enthalpies, okay?

1333
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:46,009
So life gets simpler

1334
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:48,869
in a sense, with
this, all right?

1335
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:52,209
Okay, so you all
did great today.

1336
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:53,049
That's everything you can

1337
00:48:53,049 --> 00:48:53,889
do after the lecture.

1338
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,369
I'm going to close
here. So if any of you

1339
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:55,929
have any questions,

1340
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:57,249
please feel free
to come up.

1341
00:48:57,249 --> 00:48:58,689
Thank you.
