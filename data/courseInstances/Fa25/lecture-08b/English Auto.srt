1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
So we're going
to continue with

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,240
exergy today and

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,475
the application
of it, alright?

4
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:09,470
So, our learning
objectives,

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,150
so we're going to develop

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,790
an exerge control
volume analysis,

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,710
and we're going
to apply it

8
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,150
to a chip cooling.

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,309
So it's called liquid
cooling on a chips is

10
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,990
a modern form of how
we cool CPUs and GPUs.

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,549
We'll do one on
the turbine,

12
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:23,750
and then I'll do
one on the heat

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,909
exchange of the
power plant.

14
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:27,030
I'll wait until
I get excited,

15
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,309
and we'll wait
actually until

16
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,030
the next couple
of chapters

17
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,949
when we get into
power cycles,

18
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,669
and then you'll be
able to do that.

19
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,030
In terms of the quiz,

20
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,509
everything will
be uploaded at

21
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:39,789
the latest
tomorrow morning.

22
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,549
Hopefully tonight
we went through

23
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,140
an overall I think
I'm pretty satisfied.

24
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,980
All right, so
recycling waste heat.

25
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,899
So you may or may not
know you do know if you

26
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,259
read any amount of news
with data centers,

27
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,459
or demand for compute.

28
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:59,139
We have a huge amount
of pressure, you know,

29
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,379
put on the
electricity grid in

30
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,530
terms of running
computers.

31
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,800
Right? So you
take electricity,

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,799
which is the highest
form of energy, right?

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,799
So the highest form of

34
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,279
exergy is anything
I can do work,

35
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,999
right? They're
equivalent, right?

36
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:15,359
A W in would
also be an in,

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,919
right, when it
comes to that.

38
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:18,479
So electricity is because

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,839
it can be transferred
in as work,

40
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:21,720
right, that's the
highest form of energy.

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,999
You run it in, you

42
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,999
compute something,
all right?

43
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,200
And I represent
this as a poster,

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,439
because that's
all it is, right?

45
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,280
Essentially, you do
that, you compute,

46
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,479
but everything
that goes in to

47
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,119
compute becomes
heat, right?

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,959
It's transferred
basically as heat.

49
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,159
The way we used to cool

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,439
this is a lot
of air, right?

51
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,559
A lot of fans would like,

52
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,959
move air and blow it over.

53
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,629
Um, And then, you know,

54
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:44,149
in recent years and stuff,

55
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:45,389
people have, you know,

56
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:46,829
recent decades and stuff,

57
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,909
people have looked in
and figured out that,

58
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,109
hey, not only with air,

59
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,069
but this could also be

60
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,029
done with liquid, right?

61
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,469
And that really, so the

62
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,869
balance and people
would look at that is,

63
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,070
right, I have some
energy in to compute.

64
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,630
And from a first
law analysis,

65
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,149
if I don't want this
thing to melt down,

66
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:05,549
I'm going to take
all that heat off.

67
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,269
So people would look at
this, and in general,

68
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:08,629
when they analyze
these systems,

69
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,390
they think about
the first law

70
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,070
of thermodynamics,
like that.

71
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,190
I put this in and

72
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,925
it's heat and
I take it off.

73
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,699
Can, however, take a
second law approach.

74
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,620
You can use exergy, and
that's the purpose of

75
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,854
this example
is not to just

76
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,374
take a first law
analysis of this,

77
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,055
but a second law and
see if there are

78
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,980
opportunities to use
this, all right?

79
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,500
This isn't just fiction.

80
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,135
So this was done. So
my former building,

81
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:30,575
when I was at It Ha was

82
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:31,579
partially heated by

83
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,699
this thing called aquasar.

84
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,735
You can read it on
Wiki. But essentially,

85
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:35,499
what you would do here is

86
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:36,575
you'd have these
cold plates.

87
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:37,620
So this is like a blade,

88
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,620
a server blade that

89
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
you would take in and out.

90
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,870
You'd bring in
water, All right.

91
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,230
And he would be
transferred from

92
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,150
the hotter chips into

93
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,669
the water and then taken

94
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,590
and basically taken
back out, okay?

95
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,069
So that's nothing
terribly innovative.

96
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,190
That's what you would
do, you know, if

97
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,349
you were like,
Hey, that's hot.

98
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:54,790
Let's bring like
liquid to it.

99
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,989
But what was interesting
about this is

100
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,190
that they didn't run

101
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,150
the chips at room
temperature, okay?

102
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,910
So the point of
this device is

103
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,830
that they actually let
the chips run hot.

104
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,550
And so then you
transfer heat

105
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,255
into a fluid
that's warm, okay?

106
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:13,000
All right. So hold that
thought for a second.

107
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,120
And the nice part about
it is if you do that,

108
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,440
you'll take hot water that

109
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,079
makes it even
slightly hotter,

110
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,680
and then you can use
that, that water

111
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,160
that has utility
to it, okay?

112
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,200
Higher org, all right?

113
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,039
Okay. And you can do
carbon neutral compute.

114
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,280
So all these
challenges of, like,

115
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
water cooling and
all of that, fine.

116
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,559
But if you did this,

117
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,839
you wouldn't
have you know,

118
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,040
you'd solve a
lot of problems

119
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
if you thought, like,
with the second law.

120
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,719
Alright, so what
does this look like?

121
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,319
So if I was going
to represent again,

122
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,719
kind of a
simplified version

123
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,079
for the purposes
of this analysis.

124
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,360
So here's our toaster

125
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,760
here, so the
computer chip.

126
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
That's mounted to what's

127
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,680
called the cold plate.

128
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,760
So this copper
thing that you

129
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,120
see here is called
the cold plate.

130
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm bringing a fluid in.

131
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,520
This is water,
in this case.

132
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
And then I have

133
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,320
the fluid that's
basically exiting here.

134
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,720
The inlet, let's call it.

135
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
I think I'm going
to call it state

136
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,279
one. Let me just clarify.

137
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,450
No idea. Okay, we're
going to call it one.

138
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,970
We're going to call
it two for this.

139
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,170
And we'll leave it up
like that for now,

140
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,370
but we can think
about a couple of

141
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,770
different control
volumes when we

142
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,690
actually to do
the analysis.

143
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,969
So what we'd like
to do, so again,

144
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,929
we're given what we'd
like to determine.

145
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:30,419
We'd like to determine
The following things.

146
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:31,579
We'd like to determine

147
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,739
the second law efficiency.

148
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,459
So what I'm going
to call is Eta

149
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,019
underscore Roman
numeral two.

150
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:47,020
We want to determine
the Xergy terms.

151
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,099
All right.

152
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,539
And the other
thing we want to

153
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,340
determine is to calculate

154
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,939
the second law
efficiency as

155
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,179
a function of
T one, right?

156
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:58,779
So as a function
of the inlet

157
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,099
temperature of the water.

158
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,580
So those are the three
things that we're

159
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,219
going to determine, okay?

160
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,129
Okay.

161
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:07,889
And I'll go through

162
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:08,650
some of the
things that are

163
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,929
given as it naturally
comes up here,

164
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:11,329
but, like,

165
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,930
there's obviously
for this analysis,

166
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,169
I'm not showing
you a pump.

167
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,930
So I'm just analyzing
this as a device.

168
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,650
I could, of course,
do a wider one

169
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,930
that looks at the
different components.

170
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,649
I'm going to make
some assumptions

171
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:23,369
about those and
put them in.

172
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:26,089
Okay? Again, our substance

173
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,929
here is water. Okay.

174
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,549
Mm hmm. What are
our assumptions we

175
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:33,870
can look at maybe we'll

176
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,709
draw can draw in green.

177
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,589
This is maybe
our control this

178
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,269
is like our control
volume here.

179
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:48,789
Like that. That's
our CV. All right.

180
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,009
Okay. All right,

181
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:52,769
so we have an assumption
of a control volume,

182
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,409
we've mass that crosses
the boundaries.

183
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,889
Properties, we're going
to determined with

184
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,049
Pi kilo because this

185
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:57,929
is going to involve water.

186
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:00,650
I'm not going to use, I'm

187
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,050
not going to use that
as an alternative

188
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,689
because I'm not
boiling water here.

189
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,089
A CP Delta T

190
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,729
might be a sensible
approach, right,

191
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:09,329
for computing the
let's say the work

192
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:12,449
that's transferred then
is heat into there.

193
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,569
It's a steady flow
process, okay?

194
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,729
So the mass flow
rate in is equal to

195
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,689
the mass that's
out, right?

196
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,049
The work, right,

197
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:22,970
that I'm transferring
electrically

198
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,289
here is then going to be

199
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:25,730
balanced then with heat

200
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,689
that's generated
and carried out.

201
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,129
With no shaft
work. And because

202
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,649
this is an
isobaric device,

203
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:34,490
the pressure, there is

204
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,930
no pressure drop
across 1-2.

205
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,089
Right? So let's start
off with our first one.

206
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:42,809
So the first thing is
that the definition of

207
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:46,649
what we call as the
second law efficiency is,

208
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:47,929
again, the ratio of

209
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,529
things that we
have to spend,

210
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,329
right, to things
that we like, right?

211
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,850
And in exergy analysis,

212
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,130
this is what we
call as Xergy Xergy

213
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,969
expended All right.

214
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,730
And that's in
the denominator,

215
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,250
and then in the
numerator, it's

216
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,290
orgy recovered.

217
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,089
And I'll get into a
second what we mean

218
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,970
by expended and recovered,

219
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,769
but it's not so different
from what we did

220
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,889
before when we were

221
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:19,089
talking about
efficiencies, right?

222
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:22,209
That would be like maybe
Q in and W net out.

223
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,769
A Xergy that could
be, you know,

224
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:26,129
recovered in a
lot of systems

225
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,649
maybe like a workout
term, right?

226
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:28,970
Here, we'll get
into the meaning

227
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,034
of what XRgy
recovered is, though.

228
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,539
Okay, before I
get into that,

229
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,019
we can look at
just a simple

230
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,499
example of a
heater, though.

231
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:43,179
So if I just go in
without as an aside,

232
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,459
so if I look at a simple,

233
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,459
I can do a simple
heater, right?

234
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,339
And so what a
simple heater

235
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,859
might look like is, again,

236
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,300
I have this maybe
a resistor,

237
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,979
you know, here, okay?

238
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,779
And so maybe this

239
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,509
is my you know,
control volume.

240
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:04,829
So I transfer
some work in.

241
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,589
So there's basically
a W electrical in,

242
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,789
and then I'll have a write

243
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,589
a Q out associated
with that.

244
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,149
So right, I'll
have a W in,

245
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,949
which is the
electrical, and then,

246
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,149
you know, a Q out of that.

247
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,070
So the second
law efficiency

248
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,109
of this simplified case,

249
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,870
so we can call this
heater or maybe toaster

250
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,909
and call it
toaster is, again,

251
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,669
we can deal with you,

252
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:31,750
we'll deal with
rate terms,

253
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,430
so the rate that we

254
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,709
transfer energy
in and the rate

255
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:34,910
that we transfer heat out.

256
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,070
So there's your udt
recovered, right?

257
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:45,750
There's your X dot
expended. All right.

258
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,230
So what do you

259
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,390
think that we're
expending here?

260
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,590
So in our toast or
our heater example,

261
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,150
what am I putting
in? Work, right?

262
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,390
So, and work is
the same, right?

263
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,430
So work is the highest
form of energy.

264
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,230
And what it means is
that it's also exergy.

265
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,310
So these are
interchangeable. All right?

266
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,150
So here I'll have a W dot.

267
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:13,349
I call it w.in. So
here's my w.in.

268
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:16,110
And then what I'm
recovering here out of it,

269
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,390
so what comes out
of this system

270
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,430
then is this heat, okay?

271
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,630
So I'll go X dot,
Heat. All right.

272
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,670
Surrounding this
heater, I have to

273
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,110
define some dead
state conditions.

274
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,190
So T zero is the dead
state temperature,

275
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,510
which we usually would
take as, like, maybe,

276
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,149
I don't know
what 25 Celsius

277
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,550
and a dead state pressure,

278
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,469
which is, you know,
1 atmosphere.

279
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,750
How do we define
the rgy of heat?

280
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,910
Does anyone
remember? How do

281
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,270
we state the
quality of heat.

282
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,490
So what is the
formula that tells

283
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,370
us the maximum work

284
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,250
I can get out for
a unit of heat in?

285
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,010
What is the most
efficient engine?

286
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,410
Karno.

287
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,930
Okay? So when you think
about this with heat,

288
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,250
you think Carn, right?

289
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,410
So the X dot heat,
in this case, then,

290
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,969
is going to be
this q.aq dot

291
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:19,049
out here times
essentially something

292
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:20,849
that resembles a
cardo efficiency,

293
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:24,649
one minus the dead
state temperature

294
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:30,690
divided by H, okay?

295
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,530
All right? Now,
I don't know.

296
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,969
And so that would
be the numerator,

297
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,890
and then our denominator
then would be

298
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,690
dot would be w dot, right?

299
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,010
Okay.

300
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,730
Yes. And so from

301
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,010
a first law point
of view, right?

302
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,929
So if I have a steady
flow system here,

303
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,490
so I have a steady
flow device,

304
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,209
what is coming
in is equal to

305
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,770
what is coming out there?

306
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,330
What do you
suspect you could

307
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,730
say about q dot out and

308
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,450
w.in? It should be
the same, right?

309
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,570
And so what you'll
see in this

310
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,770
kind of simplify it again,

311
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,649
toaster example is that

312
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:10,930
this is going to be one

313
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,410
minus the dead
state temperature

314
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,130
T zero divided
by the H. Now,

315
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,489
H in here is not defined,

316
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:21,609
TH would be something
you'd have to take e109

317
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,050
and figure out then heat

318
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,690
transfer to figure
out what it would be.

319
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,970
But what does this say?

320
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,209
What from this formula?

321
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,770
If I look at
the second law

322
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,209
efficiency for
this formula,

323
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,010
what's like a take
home message?

324
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,950
The more In name?

325
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,110
Zach. Zach. So Zach

326
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,789
said something
very astute,

327
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,310
which is that if

328
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,470
I run my toaster at a
higher temperature,

329
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,710
and let's say I blow
air over, you know,

330
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,390
or if I'm able to
heat up, you know,

331
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,189
air here if air
coming in here is

332
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,389
coming in at basically
a higher temperature,

333
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,909
then this is
going to behave

334
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,390
more efficiently, okay?

335
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,750
So the warmer is the
air that I bring in,

336
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,510
and then I transfer
heat into it,

337
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,270
the more efficient
is going to be

338
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,950
this process of electrical
work in heat out.

339
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,550
And this is done all
the time, right?

340
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,149
So you think
about every oven.

341
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:20,630
You know,

342
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,630
electrical oven
basically operates on

343
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,230
this, you know, on
this principle.

344
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,750
Of course, those
less eicient because

345
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,669
you're bringing
in cold air

346
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:28,710
and you're
heating them up.

347
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,629
So you're pretty much

348
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:30,750
killing all your excergy,

349
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,270
but you do get
nice cooked food.

350
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,190
But if you want this
to be more efficient,

351
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,989
then you should heat up

352
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:35,910
air that's already kind

353
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,750
of kind of warmer,
all right?

354
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,270
So that's an aside,
but that kind of

355
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,790
tells you where
we're headed.

356
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,950
So that's the
simple heater,

357
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,429
simple toaster example.

358
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,430
So for the case of
electronics cooling,

359
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,150
I want to make sure.

360
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,830
Yeah, I'm still
recording pretty well.

361
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,389
For the case of
electronics cooling,

362
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,189
it's the same formula.

363
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,350
So we have this.

364
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,544
Again, it's the ratio
of X dot recovered.

365
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:05,699
Divided by X dot expended.

366
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,660
All right. All right.

367
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,659
All right. So reflecting

368
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,379
on our example
with our toaster,

369
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,659
what is one type of exergy

370
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:23,340
or what do you think is

371
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,939
the exergy that we're
recovering here?

372
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,420
Zach?

373
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,579
Yeah, so you're going to

374
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,780
have there is your X dot,

375
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,060
we're going to
call it here is

376
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,140
X dot outlet, okay?

377
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,179
And so what is the outlet?

378
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:43,940
Right? Right? So
this is what's

379
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,300
leaving the system
here is at state two.

380
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,259
Hopefully, that's
visible. It is.

381
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,100
And so this is

382
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,460
the energy that
we're gonna recover.

383
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,580
This fluid stream that's

384
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,139
like leaving
here is going to

385
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,659
actually be the exergy

386
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,260
that we recover, right?

387
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,180
So X dot outlet, right?

388
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,059
Okay, what are
we expending?

389
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:07,059
So what forms of exergy

390
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,860
or what energy
terms do you think

391
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,739
that what are things

392
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:10,700
that we're spending here?

393
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,779
What are things
that are going

394
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,339
into the control volume?

395
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,460
At this side of the room.

396
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,500
David, first, since that's

397
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,140
what I saw, but it's
not fair, Kate.

398
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,539
It's actually
not a question.

399
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,980
Q times one minus over

400
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,940
T. You also mentioned

401
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,500
that xgy is equal to ST,

402
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,579
Exergy is equal to

403
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:38,380
STT. I don't
remember that.

404
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,339
Maybe I can hallucinate

405
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,620
a large language model.

406
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,100
I don't think I said
it though. I will

407
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,219
tell you this Xergy.

408
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,020
What is the
point of Xergy?

409
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,380
Exergy is like I
have some state.

410
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,580
What is the maximum
work I can get

411
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,460
out from this state
going to the dead state.

412
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,460
That's anything that's

413
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,900
reversible um, you know,

414
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,460
done in a reversible
way, you know,

415
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,220
there is going
to be work is

416
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,580
basically ergy
interchangeable, right?

417
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,019
Reversible work is exergy.

418
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,380
Heat, when talking about

419
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,260
sergy is heat, all right?

420
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,580
Work in heat from

421
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,099
the first law
are equivalent.

422
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,660
But from the
second law, we

423
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,300
know they're not, okay?

424
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,099
Um, and so the way that we

425
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:26,540
correct for that
is we use that

426
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,259
Q dot multiplied by
something that resembles,

427
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,539
in my opinion, kind of

428
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,699
a Karno efficiency
because kno efficiency,

429
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,550
right is network out
divided by heat in.

430
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,719
Okay? And so if I
had this efficiency,

431
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,920
I can simply say,
Well, you know,

432
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,359
I can convert kind of
that maximum workout

433
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,799
to the heat one, you know,

434
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:43,920
through something
that resembles kind

435
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,280
of an ET one minus T,

436
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,480
the cold temperature,
which is

437
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,520
the dead
temperature rather

438
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
of the hot
temperature, right?

439
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,360
A third thing is

440
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,645
that worked energy
heat energy.

441
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:56,769
We know that fluids can
also possess energy.

442
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,370
They also possess energy.

443
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,249
And all we do is we
take flow energy

444
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:01,410
and we minus all of our

445
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,730
terms by the dead state.

446
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,929
So H minus H naught

447
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,890
minus T naught
times minus naught.

448
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,089
So maybe this s term

449
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:10,329
that you're saying
is in that,

450
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:12,370
but it's a longer
form, okay?

451
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,170
Yes, please.
Presley, right?

452
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,609
Okay. Generated.

453
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:23,130
Okay, that's a fair
formula, right?

454
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,010
So the dead state here,

455
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:31,240
X dot destroyed
destroyed is

456
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,320
equal to g times
T naught, right?

457
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,239
So when we did
entropy generation,

458
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:42,400
if we multiply
entropy generation of

459
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,360
a device or a system

460
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,799
times the dead
state temperature,

461
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,720
we'll get the trag
destroyed, okay?

462
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,240
And that's useful because

463
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,479
then I'm not going to
use that right now,

464
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,600
but you could
use that if you

465
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,000
knew how much your
original was.

466
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,160
But that's the
relationship maybe

467
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,679
that David's mentioning.

468
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,760
David, that's
the TS thing.

469
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,160
Oh. Okay. All right.

470
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:11,839
Now, I don't
remember. Kai? Okay.

471
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,479
All right, so the point

472
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,600
is that we have an outlet.

473
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,879
Now what I'm asking is for

474
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:18,319
this system,
what are inlets?

475
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,720
What are things that
we're spending?

476
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,520
Yes, please.

477
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,519
Electrical work.

478
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,719
Electrical work, right?

479
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:25,719
So you could have
here an X dot, right?

480
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:28,519
I'll do X dot E, right?

481
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,719
Electrical. What
else? Not Kai,

482
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,994
not David, not Zach.

483
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,589
Not Presley.

484
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,149
You.

485
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:38,989
Say it again.
Mass flow, right?

486
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:41,069
You could have a, right?

487
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:43,349
So we can have
an exudt, right?

488
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:44,829
We had the mass flow of

489
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,429
the outlet, right
here, you know,

490
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:47,950
but we can have the ex dot

491
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,749
of the inlet, all right?

492
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:53,509
What's something I
haven't drawn here,

493
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,070
but you think you
might need to

494
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,229
pass a fluid through
that cold plate?

495
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,069
What causes a
fluid to move?

496
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:05,150
Yes, please.
What? Pressure.

497
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,909
And what creates
pressure besides me?

498
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,749
A pump, right?
You can have

499
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:14,829
an dot of, you know, okay.

500
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,029
All right, right?
So this is it.

501
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,829
So what am I what
am I recovering?

502
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:20,549
I'm recovering
hot water, okay?

503
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:21,789
So that's the excergy

504
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,109
of my outlet. All right?

505
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:23,909
What I'm calling here,

506
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:24,829
maybe just to be clear,

507
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,739
I'll call this as outlet.

508
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,929
All right. And
here, I'll call

509
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:32,609
this as inlet there.

510
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,049
Yeah, right? So
we have here,

511
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,650
outlet, and here
we have inlet.

512
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,209
And I'll compute
properties

513
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:40,569
at that outlet
as state two,

514
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,689
and that inlet as
the state one.

515
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,369
I haven't drawn a pump,

516
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,929
but let's say to
define the second law,

517
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,649
probably it makes
sense to consider

518
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,890
the pump moving

519
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,050
an incompressible
dense fluid,

520
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,890
so it's not going to
be a huge penalty.

521
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,649
And then this problem,

522
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:55,570
I'm just going to give you

523
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,409
a value that is there,

524
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,010
and you ultimately
want to maximize.

525
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,249
You want to maximize this.

526
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:04,629
Okay, so Let's
deal right now.

527
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,869
So with the
electrical sergy,

528
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:09,509
that's going to
be pretty clear.

529
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:12,590
So we're told that there's

530
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:22,109
100 watts of
electrical power

531
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,989
is used for the chip.

532
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,419
The chip. All right.

533
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,900
And what that
means is that

534
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,419
X dot X dot electrical

535
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:40,420
is equal to 100
watts, right?

536
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,419
Electricity is
ergy, right?

537
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,340
It's the highest form

538
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,139
of work that we can have.

539
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,059
So that we've dealt with.

540
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,929
Um, We can deal
with the pump now.

541
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,489
So for the pump,
we're told that

542
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,290
the power of the P dot,

543
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,649
so let's call that
as the power of

544
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:58,369
the pump is equal to
the pressure drop

545
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:03,290
times the volumetric
flow rate.

546
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,490
They say that this
volumetric flow rate

547
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,529
is one liter per minute,

548
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:09,289
which is kind of intense
if you think about

549
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:11,329
how small it is.

550
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:12,849
And from this analysis,

551
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:15,609
what we're told is
that it consumes that

552
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:21,490
this P dot is equal to
0.24 excuse me, 0.24.

553
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,649
Wow, I'm really okay.

554
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:28,729
0.24 watts. Allright?

555
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,889
Okay. And then this will

556
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:34,449
deal with our
pump term, right?

557
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:38,050
So basically,
our X dot pump

558
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,769
is going to be the
electrical work

559
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,569
that we transfer
in to do the pump,

560
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:43,289
so our P dot, which
is going to be

561
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:46,890
equal to 0.24 watts.

562
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,670
All right, that's fine.

563
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,709
Mm hm hm.

564
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,869
All right, so
we've dealt with?

565
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:58,869
So we've dealt with
the electrical term,

566
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:00,349
we've dealt with
the pump term,

567
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:01,949
and now we need to deal
with the flow term.

568
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:05,390
So our flow term,
does it make sense?

569
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,029
What does it make
sense to do?

570
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,470
This is kind of a monster,

571
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,229
so maybe I'll slide
that over like that.

572
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,110
So the general formula

573
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,949
for flow exergy, right?

574
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:23,149
So flow is equal

575
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,390
to the mass flow rate
of the fluid, right?

576
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,509
So let's say it's a
steady flow device.

577
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:28,389
So we're talking about

578
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,670
an outlet or
an inlet here.

579
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:38,430
M dot enthalpy of
the fluid minus

580
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,709
the dead state enthropy

581
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:41,349
so the enthalpy
at T zero and P

582
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:42,910
zero minus the dead

583
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,149
state temperature
T naught,

584
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:47,349
entropy of the fluid,

585
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,629
specific entropy
of the fluid minus

586
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:53,325
the specific dead
state entropy.

587
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:54,299
All right.

588
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,299
How do we analyze
this in practice?

589
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,060
The dead state temperature

590
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,979
should be given
in the problem.

591
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:00,859
You should know P
zero and T zero.

592
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:01,859
With that,

593
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,299
you're going to be
able to determine,

594
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,939
T zero, you'll then know,

595
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,019
and then the enthalpy

596
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:07,019
and the entropy
you'll get,

597
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:11,899
you know, PCLor that.

598
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,899
And for the specific
entropy and

599
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:15,939
entropy of the fluid,

600
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:16,819
it's the same as before.

601
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,060
You need to know
the state, right?

602
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,219
Just like we
practiced before,

603
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:20,659
you'll be able to
get the enthalpy and

604
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:22,619
the entropy by
knowing the state.

605
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,019
And the MDOT, again,

606
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:25,500
that would be something
that's probably

607
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,620
a given or determined.

608
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,539
Mm hmm.

609
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,109
Yeah. So let's
look at this.

610
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:42,950
So again, we could write
this as X dot inlet,

611
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,629
right, which is going
to be the dot, again,

612
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,789
a steady flow
device, right?

613
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:50,309
H one minus H
naught minus T

614
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:56,870
naught one minus
naught X dot outlet

615
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,830
is going to be equal to m

616
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,789
dot times H two minus H

617
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:06,390
naught minus T naught

618
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,949
two minus naught,
all right?

619
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,210
Okay. So let's

620
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,449
focus on state
one for a second.

621
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:19,969
So if we look at
state one here,

622
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:24,169
so we're told
in the analysis

623
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,929
that T one is

624
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:29,010
essentially going to be

625
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,369
an independent
variable for us, okay?

626
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,449
Or let me take a

627
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,009
so let me pause
for a second.

628
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,170
With this, we have

629
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,369
enough information
to define

630
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:40,169
our second law
efficiency. All right.

631
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,009
So we have our inlet,
we have our outlet,

632
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:48,010
which is here,
inlet and outlet.

633
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,109
Okay. And so what
it means is that

634
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:55,669
our second law
efficiency is now done.

635
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,110
The specific exergy terms,

636
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,470
we've done
electrical Exergy.

637
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,270
We've done pump exergy,

638
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,669
we've done inlet, and

639
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:05,590
we've done outlet exergy.

640
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,910
So we've basically defined

641
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,509
those terms. That's it.

642
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:09,550
And now what we're

643
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,509
going to do is
we're going to

644
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:12,669
vary the inlet
temperature, all right,

645
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:13,790
and we're going
to see how that

646
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,749
affects the

647
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,149
efficiency here
that we determine.

648
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,670
The second law efficiency,

649
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,589
how much much what's

650
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:24,789
the quality of
the heat that we

651
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:26,789
recover from this process?

652
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,830
So to do this, we'll

653
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,109
essentially say that
we know a T one,

654
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:41,799
four that we have to
define a pressure, okay?

655
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,039
And so what we'll do is

656
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,719
we'll define some P one.

657
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,559
And again, this P one
for the purposes of

658
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,799
a pump because water
is incompressible,

659
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,279
it doesn't really
matter that much.

660
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,440
But for properties,

661
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
you could say maybe 1 bar,

662
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,600
two bar of pressure

663
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,400
at some temperature that's

664
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,560
below that boiling point,

665
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,919
and that's going to
be valid, right?

666
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,920
You don't want to pick
temperatures at above

667
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,179
that boiling point because
then it gets well,

668
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,680
For the purposes
of this analysis,

669
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,199
we'd like to avoid we'd
like to avoid that,

670
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:13,880
but some chip cooling
is done with boiling.

671
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,119
But then this
temperature and

672
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,359
pressure are not
sufficient information,

673
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:16,639
right?

674
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:17,320
I have to define

675
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,559
qualities and
things like that,

676
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,199
if I'm going to get
into a two phase.

677
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,839
All right, so this
is state one.

678
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,159
And so from this again,

679
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,199
so from this, right,

680
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:32,959
we're able to know
S one and an H one.

681
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:42,600
Okay, slide this
over. Mm hmm.

682
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,159
Okay.

683
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,000
But now we need to

684
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,280
determine state
two, right?

685
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,519
So for state two, right?

686
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:08,039
We know, again, that P
two is equal to P one.

687
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,559
And again, because
we would like

688
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,920
to keep this
only for what we

689
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,239
call single
phase cooling as

690
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,719
a liquid cooling, right?

691
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,119
If we knew T two,

692
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,639
that would be
enough information.

693
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:20,199
But we currently
don't know T two.

694
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,759
What's one way you
think that you could

695
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,839
determine T two
in this problem?

696
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,560
The heat transfer.

697
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,759
That's right,
right? So we can

698
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,960
do an energy analysis.

699
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,519
We can take a
step back and do

700
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,959
our simple energy analysis
there in balance.

701
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:45,840
The rate of work
being transferred

702
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,639
in with essentially that

703
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,119
energy that's gone in,

704
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,239
right, increasing
the temperature

705
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:53,599
of the fluid at
the outlet, okay?

706
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,999
All right. So
let's do that.

707
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:57,439
So again, we can write,

708
00:26:57,439 --> 00:27:01,159
um No, maybe I'll
zoom back out.

709
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:01,919
All right.

710
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,120
So we can apply a
steady flow analysis

711
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,359
to this combined to

712
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,080
this combined
control volume.

713
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,119
And so what that will look

714
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,079
like is under
steady conditions,

715
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,799
I have aw.in plus
aq.in plus an

716
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,519
m.h1 plus W one

717
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,774
squared divided by
two plus gz one.

718
00:27:26,774 --> 00:27:32,309
Is equal to w dot
out plus Q dot out

719
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:36,909
plus m.h2 plus w

720
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,189
squared divided by
two plus g two,

721
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:41,829
and it will neglect,

722
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:42,869
as we said before

723
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,790
at the start of
the problem,

724
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,389
we're going to
neglect changes

725
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:47,630
in potential and
kinetic energy.

726
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,029
We do have aw.in,

727
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:51,390
but we don't have a Q dot

728
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,629
into that control volume.

729
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,069
We don't have a w dot out,

730
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:55,470
but we do have a Q dot,

731
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,429
and we don't have a
Q dot out, right,

732
00:27:57,429 --> 00:27:59,769
because this is, right,

733
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:01,689
an adiabatic control
volume, right?

734
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:02,850
There's no heat
in or out of

735
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,050
what I've drawn in green.

736
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,129
So there's also
then no Q dot

737
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:07,690
out of that, right?

738
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,650
All of that energy
that I'm going to be

739
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,929
putting in should
then equal.

740
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:18,809
So w.in should equal
to m.h2 minus H one.

741
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:20,890
And that makes
sense. No, I

742
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,290
would expect the fluid

743
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,049
exiting the thing
that I'm heating to

744
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,089
have higher enthalpy
than the inlet, right?

745
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,049
So the electrical,
you know,

746
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,210
power that I put
in should be

747
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,729
the mass flow rate
of the fluid,

748
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:33,490
M dot times the
difference of

749
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,114
the enthalpy H two
minus H one, all right?

750
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:40,180
Now, this is a fluid,

751
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,180
and it's going to
stay as a fluid.

752
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,139
So one approximation,
you could make here is

753
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:51,940
an M dot cp T two
minus T one, right?

754
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,899
And so the way that we can

755
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,499
determine T two, right?

756
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:56,459
We could do it
the other way.

757
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:57,220
I could go in and I

758
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,019
can do property
tables with this.

759
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:02,099
I could solve for
what is this?

760
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:04,660
This is an H
two is equal to

761
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:11,779
w.in divided by m dot
plus H one, right?

762
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,979
So you can determine
enthalpy at state

763
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:15,459
two from this because

764
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:17,779
I'll have H two, and
then I'd have P two.

765
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:20,140
So with H two, P
two and P color,

766
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,740
then you could determine
then S two, right?

767
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,179
So, or H two, right?

768
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:33,279
And from this, you
can then get S two.

769
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,619
The other way to do
this is the following.

770
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:39,739
I could then go and say
that T two is equal

771
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:44,419
to W dot N divided
by m dot cp,

772
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:46,779
and then that's plus one.

773
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:49,180
That's the other way

774
00:29:49,180 --> 00:30:00,419
to do that. Mmm.

775
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,429
Okay. Yeah, so with

776
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:24,590
either of these
approaches,

777
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,429
then I know right,

778
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:28,429
I'll know basically my
state my state two,

779
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:31,590
and I'll get the
specific entropy,

780
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,670
which my slide.

781
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,469
Um, right?

782
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:47,109
So here, right, X
dot electrical lin,

783
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:48,549
I know, that's fixed.

784
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:52,469
X dot pump is a fixed
X dot inlet, right?

785
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:53,749
We were able to
determine because

786
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:55,029
I knew state one, right?

787
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,429
So I could get
one and S one,

788
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,309
S zero, T zero,
and H zero,

789
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:02,950
I knew from the dead
state properties,

790
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,750
which is the same way,

791
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,990
maybe just for
completeness,

792
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,029
state zero,

793
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:10,709
right is basically
T zero and P zero.

794
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:16,190
And from that, I know,
H naught and naught.

795
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,869
By knowing state
one, I know H

796
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:21,389
one and I know S one.
So this is good.

797
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:24,550
By using the
energy analysis,

798
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,630
steady flow
energy analysis

799
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,750
of a control volume.

800
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,469
I can determine H two
by determining H two

801
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:32,029
and knowing that P
two is equal to P

802
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,750
one because it's
a heat exchanger.

803
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,589
I know S two.

804
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:38,430
So I come here, H
two, I know H naught,

805
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,709
I know T naught,
I now know

806
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:41,310
S two, and I
know S naught?

807
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,309
And now I have X
dot outlet, right?

808
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,510
Other way to go
is to do this,

809
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,390
determine T two, but
it's the same thing.

810
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,269
With T two and then
the pressure P two,

811
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:52,069
you'll also know as two.

812
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:56,350
Yes, please. I
why do we have to

813
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,960
include the dot if
it's not like quality?

814
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,279
Because I have
smart students,

815
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,479
and if I didn't
put it here,

816
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,840
your very next
question would be,

817
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,040
but isn't there a
pump profit and

818
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,119
doesn't it cost energy,

819
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,519
and it shouldn't be there?

820
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,680
Isn't that account
from the stock?

821
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,324
No. No.

822
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:18,089
So, again,

823
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:19,569
this is maybe you
could get rid of it.

824
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:20,889
So maybe now if
we wanted to,

825
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:21,689
you could definitely get

826
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,889
rid of it and stick to

827
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:24,210
the control
volume that I've

828
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,449
drawn here to be
strictly correct,

829
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:27,889
for that control
volume, right,

830
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,609
there is no X dot pump,

831
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:33,009
and it's a very tiny
value, all right?

832
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:34,649
But yeah, you could go in

833
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:36,570
and look at it, but fine.

834
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,529
For the purposes of
this, maybe we can drop

835
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:39,290
that and keep it

836
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,930
simple for the
control volume.

837
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,209
I have an X dot outlet,

838
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:45,690
an an electricity input,

839
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,690
and then a fluid input.

840
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,050
I think what
you're saying is

841
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,249
that if I
transferred the work

842
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:53,794
in so if I drew the
control volume, um,

843
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:56,500
larger there
around the device,

844
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,980
and I took up the
entire device,

845
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,739
there would be no there

846
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,699
would basically be
no inlet, right?

847
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:05,299
And then I would
argue that there is

848
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,380
no outlet then
at that point,

849
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,899
which then makes
this kind of and

850
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:10,540
that's fine. We can
go to the next stage.

851
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,060
And what you would
have is there's

852
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,379
another heat exchanger and

853
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:15,259
a reservoir, and we
transfer from that.

854
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,579
So I think your
thinking is right,

855
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,459
but I guess, trust
me, all right?

856
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:21,739
This makes sense. But
to be strictly correct,

857
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:23,020
like this is for what I've

858
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,299
drawn, I have an right?

859
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,059
I'm recovering
hot water out.

860
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:28,019
I am putting
electricity in,

861
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,659
and I am putting
hot water in.

862
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:32,659
So this is valid. So
let's stick with that.

863
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,770
So now, you know,
okay, fine.

864
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,729
Go on. It's a small
number anyways.

865
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:41,489
It doesn't
matter, you know,

866
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,329
again, you're pumping
like a liquid.

867
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:44,849
There's not big changes

868
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:46,289
in enthalpy if
you're pumping,

869
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,449
like a dense fluid,
okay? But heat, right?

870
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:49,929
I put a lot of heat
in and out, like,

871
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:50,569
that's going to produce

872
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:51,849
a big change in enthalpy.

873
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:54,009
Alright. But the point
is that you have this,

874
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:55,649
and what you can do is

875
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:57,329
you can plot
this, all right?

876
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:59,690
And maybe oops.

877
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,010
So if you go in and you

878
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,609
plot this,

879
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,309
All right.

880
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,309
And you look. So this

881
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:27,550
is the inlet temperature.

882
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,069
So if I have an
inlet, you know,

883
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,429
temperature that's
basically getting

884
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,990
close to the dead
state temperature,

885
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,629
I'm not going to recover
anything, right?

886
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:39,269
Because if I end up with

887
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:42,589
an outlet where H
two is equal to

888
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:48,030
80, zero, zero, gone.

889
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,830
Okay? So if you dump

890
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,469
this heat into air
at room temperature,

891
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,189
you will recover
no exergy.

892
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:56,669
Your second law efficiency

893
00:34:56,669 --> 00:34:57,549
is going to be zero.

894
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:59,869
But this is how they
design data centers for,

895
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:02,149
like, all of time.

896
00:35:02,149 --> 00:35:05,469
Seriously. You start to

897
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,309
increase the
temperature of

898
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:09,229
the fluid brought in
to cool the chip.

899
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:11,029
The consequence of that is

900
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:12,509
to have heat transferred

901
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:13,590
from the chip
to the fluid,

902
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,509
that means the chip has to

903
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:15,789
be run hotter, okay?

904
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:18,149
Electro engineers
don't like that,

905
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,309
if there's any
in the room.

906
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:22,629
I'm speaking for you now.

907
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:24,269
But the warmer that you

908
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:25,429
get it, the better
that it is.

909
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:26,749
And what's
interesting is once

910
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,390
you get beyond,

911
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,189
let's say, you know,

912
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:32,709
50, 60 Celsius,
you end up with

913
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,949
a second law efficiency

914
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:35,309
that's not
terrible, right?

915
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:36,789
It justifies
looking at it.

916
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,149
And the reason is that at

917
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:40,109
this temperature as well,

918
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:42,149
water that warm becomes

919
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:43,950
economically valuable.

920
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,469
Right? Like, you can
put $1 value to,

921
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:48,229
like, heat, you know,
brought in, right?

922
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,869
If I have a
reservoir, let's say,

923
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:51,429
a water heater, okay?

924
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:52,789
You can say pretty
well, like,

925
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,630
what that could be used
or building heating.

926
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,589
You go to our colleagues
in architecture.

927
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:57,709
The students there,
they can put

928
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:59,349
a number to that, right?

929
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:00,789
And that can force

930
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:01,749
you to think
about a design.

931
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:03,829
So in San Jose, they
look at, you know,

932
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,269
locating data
centers next to,

933
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,469
like, residences
for, like,

934
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:07,909
this reason is
because you take

935
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:10,069
a second law approach
and you look at this,

936
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:12,254
and actually it's not

937
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,559
totally doom and
gloom, right?

938
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,040
You could end up
doing compute.

939
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,519
It was already heat you're

940
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,239
going to use, all right?

941
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,919
And you think
about this more

942
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,039
intelligently and how you

943
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:24,439
design it and it
becomes useful, okay?

944
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:25,639
So that's second
law of thinking.

945
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,519
Most time first law,
electricity, again,

946
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,839
I got to take heat
out, but actually

947
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,600
it's an opportunity
if you know energy.

948
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,800
And that's why you
should know energy,

949
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,599
because it's modern
analysis, all right?

950
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,959
Cool. This is thermal
if you want to be here.

951
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:40,110
All right. I made a face.

952
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,469
I said exergy. It
makes them go.

953
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:44,949
All right.

954
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:46,469
Are there any
questions about that?

955
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,429
Yes, please.

956
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,949
I can't hear you
say it again.

957
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:53,749
Sure. That's what I'm

958
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:59,659
asking. That's a
great question.

959
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,219
So, where's the dead
state? Now, this is

960
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:05,299
a little bit like what
is dead, all right?

961
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:08,179
So go to Alright, no.

962
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:11,700
Alright. So I hold

963
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,979
back my dead
stories, all right?

964
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:14,979
So the point is that
what people do,

965
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:16,899
what they look
at, is they say,

966
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:18,860
All right, here's
my device.

967
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,979
Can I, like, quantify
my surroundings?

968
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:23,619
So, like, I have
this thing.

969
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,099
What's my
environment? Right?

970
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,659
Here I'm in this room.

971
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:29,739
My environment could be
the air in this room,

972
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:32,259
or it could be the air
outside, all right?

973
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:34,064
And most people would say,

974
00:37:34,064 --> 00:37:36,029
It's the air
outside, right?

975
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:37,029
The conditions that are

976
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:38,029
basically, you
know, outside,

977
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:39,229
and, you know,
what we call

978
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:39,830
the environment,

979
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,029
you would call is
the dead state.

980
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:42,429
For the purposes
of this class,

981
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,029
we say T zero and P zero

982
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,109
are like 25 Celsius and

983
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:48,629
1 atmosphere or 20
degrees Celsius

984
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:50,670
and 1 atmosphere
is when in doubt,

985
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,429
like, that's
your dead state,

986
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:55,079
right? Does that
make sense?

987
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,639
Yes. I'm qualifying
it because, you know,

988
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,439
some people have
different like,

989
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,239
not all devices may

990
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,960
encounter the dead
state in operation.

991
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,599
And so this is

992
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,560
actually an area where
people still research

993
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,839
and figure out is really

994
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:13,040
the dead state for
this device operation

995
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,839
actually the outdoor
conditions or not,

996
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,320
alright?

997
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,779
So if you put
this into a very

998
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:30,059
hot if you put this
into a very hot room,

999
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,900
I mean, the utility

1000
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,340
of this really doesn't

1001
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,979
care about what the
room is, right?

1002
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,700
It's where can
this be pumped

1003
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,619
to then heat
something else.

1004
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:43,099
If you wanted to live
next to you know,

1005
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:45,299
the servers, all right?

1006
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,979
That's within your
rights, right?

1007
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,460
You could live next
to the toaster

1008
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,859
and, like, stay warm.

1009
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:51,219
But I can tell you, if you

1010
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:52,619
ever go into one
of these things,

1011
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,660
they are so loud, so loud.

1012
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,020
Like, you need
hearing protection.

1013
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,459
Just to walk into
a machine room,

1014
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:01,820
it is in a word
unpleasant, Allright?

1015
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,739
No one is in there with

1016
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:05,459
these they're loud, right?

1017
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:09,419
There's lots of things
happening, okay?

1018
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:11,059
Yeah, but this Class T,

1019
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,579
P zero is 25 C
in 1 atmosphere.

1020
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,459
And if you want to
discuss with me more,

1021
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:17,860
I'm happy to in
office hours.

1022
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,900
Come to office hours.

1023
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,814
Other questions
about this.

1024
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,930
So I know it's weird.

1025
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,209
I know this is,
like, weird to

1026
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:25,649
write it in this way,
and it may take time.

1027
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:27,249
Maybe none of you
will realize it in

1028
00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:30,049
this semester, you know,

1029
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:32,809
but it is a way that
we can start to

1030
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:35,689
analyze more complicated
systems, all right?

1031
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:36,930
Hybrid systems,

1032
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,730
thermal electricity and
ultimately optimize.

1033
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,009
And that's where
all of it's going.

1034
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:43,210
Everything in energy
is hybridization,

1035
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,490
and you need approach

1036
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,610
that can really do apples

1037
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,729
to apples of
something that is

1038
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:48,129
not apples to
apples, right?

1039
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:50,090
And he didn't work
or not, alright?

1040
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,609
Great. Thank you for that.

1041
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:59,369
Okay. Um, do, do do to do.

1042
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,070
I feel like the
Kansas City Chiefs,

1043
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,749
I just burned off
like 40 minutes

1044
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:05,790
in one drive
here, alright?

1045
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:08,829
Good. Did do.

1046
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:10,830
I lost my cursor.

1047
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,739
Here we go.
This All right.

1048
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:16,299
So what I'm going
to go through now,

1049
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:18,459
I think probably
the one that's most

1050
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,619
useful to see here is

1051
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,620
the second law
efficiency of a turbine.

1052
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,099
And when I
analyze this one,

1053
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:25,979
think about isentropic

1054
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:27,779
efficiency I
defined before.

1055
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:29,579
So, you think
about isentropic

1056
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,019
efficiency I
defined before,

1057
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:32,899
that is the real
work out of

1058
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:36,299
your system divided by
the reversible work,

1059
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:37,620
right, when this behaved

1060
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,819
isotropic. All right?

1061
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:43,139
Now, think about
that while I race.

1062
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,089
And I might have
mentioned it before,

1063
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,169
but we're going to be

1064
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,409
teaching a data
center class,

1065
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:05,210
energy modeling
class in the spring.

1066
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,930
It's open for
undergraduates.

1067
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,050
It is a tech elective.

1068
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,450
We put it in a petition

1069
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,250
with engineering
Student Services,

1070
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,089
so it'll be treated as

1071
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:13,369
a tech elective
for those that

1072
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:15,089
are interested in
these kinds of things.

1073
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:16,449
All right.

1074
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,449
All right to do.

1075
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,649
All right. That is good.

1076
00:41:29,649 --> 00:41:31,169
Okay.

1077
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:45,929
Cool. Okay. Question?
No. All right.

1078
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,290
Yeah, so we have
here a turbine.

1079
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,569
Let's see, it
looks like this.

1080
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:56,530
We have an inlet. It looks

1081
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,610
like that. We
have an outlet.

1082
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:03,729
It looks like that.
Here's some shaft work

1083
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,849
that's being transferred
out of this.

1084
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:09,210
So let's say this
is maybe our inlet.

1085
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:15,210
This is our outlet.
Control volume.

1086
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:25,449
From that inlet.

1087
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,129
So it's adiabatic, right?

1088
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:30,369
So we have no q.in

1089
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,889
is equal to Q dot out,
is equal to zero.

1090
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,369
This runs on air. So
our substance is air.

1091
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:42,969
And for state one,

1092
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:53,669
We have P one is equal
to 550 pa and T one,

1093
00:42:53,669 --> 00:43:01,269
which is 425
Kelvin, 425 Kelvin.

1094
00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:04,429
So from this, we have
complete information,

1095
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,309
H one and our S one for

1096
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:13,729
state two, What
are we told?

1097
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:19,609
We are told that
it leaves a P two,

1098
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:28,169
which is equal to
110 pa and T two,

1099
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:32,769
which is 325
Kelvin, right?

1100
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:36,409
So it means we know H
two and we know S two.

1101
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:38,889
And our dead
state temperature

1102
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:39,689
that we're given.

1103
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:46,689
So out here, and our T
zero is 25 degrees C,

1104
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:53,369
and our P zero is going
to be 101325 pascal.

1105
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:55,929
So that's our dead
state condition.

1106
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:01,489
All right. Fine. So what

1107
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:02,969
is the formula for

1108
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:05,609
W dot out of a
turbine like that?

1109
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,809
If I have this
as my M dot,

1110
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:10,729
steady flow, and
I have this m.in.

1111
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,109
All right, it's well,

1112
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,029
we can call it
like this, right?

1113
00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:19,029
It'd be dot and then,
you know, W out.

1114
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,990
All right, which
is our M dot times

1115
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:31,269
H and H one minus RH two.

1116
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,389
Well, that's
easy. So that's

1117
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:36,709
our dot, dot out.

1118
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:38,349
The second law efficiency,

1119
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:40,189
what's the second law
efficiency going to be

1120
00:44:40,189 --> 00:44:42,950
equal to here
for a turbine?

1121
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,069
All right.

1122
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:46,669
So it's our real
workout. All right.

1123
00:44:46,669 --> 00:44:47,829
Remember, we're
going to, like,

1124
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:49,869
contrast this with
what we had before.

1125
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:54,149
So that's going to be
our W dot out there.

1126
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,069
All right, it's going

1127
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:57,189
to be reversible, right,

1128
00:44:57,189 --> 00:45:01,149
of a reversible,
reversible

1129
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:05,349
work that's that's there.

1130
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:07,229
And so what this is
going to look like,

1131
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:10,230
right, is it is
going to be W dot,

1132
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:20,549
out divided by essentially
the X dot, right,

1133
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:22,949
basically our X dot,

1134
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,189
right, our x.in, right?

1135
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:29,669
So what is, you know,

1136
00:45:29,669 --> 00:45:31,349
looking at essentially at

1137
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:33,149
at our inlet condition.

1138
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:34,789
So the x.in, right?

1139
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:37,909
This is a flow X org.

1140
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:43,870
So this is dot times

1141
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:48,430
one minus H naught
minus T naught,

1142
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,029
one minus naught, right?

1143
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:54,389
It's going to
be your x.in.

1144
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:59,709
And this gets
substitute here.

1145
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:00,909
Of course, the
other thing that we

1146
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:01,789
didn't write here was

1147
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:02,829
that we have
our state zero,

1148
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:07,629
so our state zero is
that we know P zero,

1149
00:46:07,629 --> 00:46:11,469
we know T zero, and from
that we know H zero,

1150
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:14,509
and we know S zero
from that, right?

1151
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:16,469
So our W dot out, right,

1152
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:18,309
which is the actual,
we determine

1153
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:20,589
this way, the x.in, right?

1154
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:23,609
So the reversible
work, right?

1155
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:24,930
If we operated this device

1156
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,849
isentropically between
this condition,

1157
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:30,689
right, and the
dead state, okay?

1158
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:33,689
So really what you're
doing here with this

1159
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:36,169
x.in is you're saying

1160
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,849
that I start off
at state one,

1161
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:43,489
and I drive my system
to state zero, right?

1162
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:45,329
And with this, you
can come up with

1163
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:47,889
a second law efficiency.

1164
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,330
If you substitute numbers,

1165
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,530
I come up with 60.6%.

1166
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,529
What is the
difference between

1167
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:57,769
what I have
written here as

1168
00:46:57,769 --> 00:46:59,369
a second law
efficiency and

1169
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:02,105
the isentropic
efficiency of a turbine?

1170
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:04,919
What is different
in the analysis?

1171
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,239
What if I said, you
don't have to do

1172
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:12,999
quiz two if you answer
this super well?

1173
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,199
Is that enough?

1174
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,239
How do we define
the isotropic

1175
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,320
efficiency of a turbine?

1176
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,479
There's no wrong
answers now.

1177
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:28,079
Now it's long enough
that any answer is

1178
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,400
acceptable. Kai?

1179
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:38,739
Isotropic efficiency
is the the efficiency

1180
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:42,539
that would have efficiency
efficiency over

1181
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:44,500
the work W dot actual

1182
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,980
divided by W
dot isentropic,

1183
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,899
which is.h1 minus H

1184
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:53,859
two A divided by m

1185
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:57,659
dot times H one
minus H two.

1186
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,339
So what's the difference?

1187
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:13,339
Ba Yes.

1188
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,019
I like this where
it's going.

1189
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:20,659
So what Maya says

1190
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:21,779
is that in the
bottom, right,

1191
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:24,100
we treat this process
as isentropic

1192
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,299
between State one
and State two, okay?

1193
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:28,659
State one and State two.

1194
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:30,179
So this is between State

1195
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:31,819
one and State two, right?

1196
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:33,659
What I'm saying
is that when

1197
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:38,169
you look at This,

1198
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:38,529
again,

1199
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:40,649
in the denominator of
the reversible work.

1200
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:44,329
It's not between state
one and state two.

1201
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:46,089
It's between that state

1202
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,809
and the dead state, okay?

1203
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:50,729
And that is the
difference between

1204
00:48:50,729 --> 00:48:52,649
isotropic efficiency,

1205
00:48:52,649 --> 00:48:54,849
which is good for
us in analyzing

1206
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,609
a second law
efficiency there.

1207
00:48:56,609 --> 00:48:58,849
It's like I have XerGy

1208
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:00,489
is like I have
this at state one.

1209
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:02,409
How do I get all
the work out of

1210
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:03,929
this given that that's

1211
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:05,209
my dead state
that's there?

1212
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:07,169
That's the maximum
reversible work

1213
00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:08,409
that I could get out from

1214
00:49:08,409 --> 00:49:10,810
this condition and
the environment

1215
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,359
that I live in, all right?

1216
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:14,949
Whereas, like
this here from

1217
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:17,309
an isentropic
efficiency of

1218
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:19,069
a turbine, you
have state one,

1219
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:21,469
you have state two, or
you have state one,

1220
00:49:21,469 --> 00:49:23,189
and you know something
about state two,

1221
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:24,349
like the pressure,
and then

1222
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:25,909
you assume it's
isentropic.

1223
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:27,750
So it's like giving
two pressures,

1224
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,309
an upstream and a
downstream from

1225
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:32,350
a turbine and a
temperature upstream,

1226
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,069
you know, you can

1227
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:36,509
determine HTS
from that, right?

1228
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:42,869
Okay. Yes, please. You are

1229
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:44,029
definitely assuming
that this is

1230
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:45,310
an isotropic and it's

1231
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,789
isentropic to
the dead state.

1232
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,229
Okay? All right.
With that,

1233
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:48,909
I'm going to close.

1234
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:50,909
If you have questions,
I'm up here.

1235
00:49:50,909 --> 00:49:54,950
That concludes our
exergy section.
