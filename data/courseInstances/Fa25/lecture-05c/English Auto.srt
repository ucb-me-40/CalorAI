1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,560
Alright, I got 210. I'm
going to get started.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,360
So today we're talking

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,880
about steady flow
energy analysis again.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,200
So far we've done
compressors and turbine.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,480
Today we'll work
on throttling

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
and heat exchangers,
if time permits,

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,479
I'll also either
start or hopefully

8
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,560
completely finish an
unsteady flow process

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
that's actually
relevant for

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,879
some applications
in research, okay?

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,279
Exactly. So we can
start with this.

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,280
So we'll look
at this system.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,919
This is does anyone
know what this is?

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,300
Air conditioner,
refrigerator.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,579
Yeah. Essentially, here,

16
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,179
what you have is

17
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,499
a compressor that
takes a fluid,

18
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,700
usually a refrigerant
transfers

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,739
work into it, right?

20
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,539
Creates a higher
pressure forces

21
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:55,499
this refrigerant to
condense, right?

22
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:58,019
So you go from this
vapor to the liquid.

23
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,379
You get a lot of heat,

24
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:00,579
right, that's
transferred out of it.

25
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,099
So this is in

26
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:02,659
the fridge right
in the back of it.

27
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:05,319
You'll see typically
like a you know,

28
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,559
a heat exchanger and a lot

29
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:08,159
of warmth coming
off of it.

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,879
Out of that, then, right,

31
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,399
we have an
expansion valve.

32
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:12,879
So this is something
that goes from

33
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,079
very high pressure
to low pressure.

34
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,319
Essentially, you get

35
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,560
the liquid ready
to evaporate,

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,879
which is then what happens
in the evaporator.

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,239
And then this is where
it cools, right?

38
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,519
So he transferred,
for example,

39
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,079
into a fridge, right,

40
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,559
that keeps the
inside of it cool.

41
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:30,599
Or if it's a Right.

42
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,039
An air conditioning
unit, right?

43
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,239
That's when you
would pass air over

44
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,880
to then cool the
building and then loop.

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,199
Key aspects to this

46
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,399
system in solving
it, right?

47
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,199
We'll go through
this today,

48
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,920
but essentially
heat exchangers.

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,239
For the purposes
of this class,

50
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,479
we assume that
there's, like,

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,279
no pressure drop
across them, right?

52
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:48,919
We can get into, you
know, validity of that.

53
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:50,280
But essentially, we assume

54
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,575
these are
isobaric devices.

55
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:55,510
Right the compressor.

56
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,789
We'll analyze some of

57
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,149
that you know,
a bit later.

58
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,390
Again, a heat exchanger.

59
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,589
And then the
expansion valve,

60
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:01,509
what we'll get
into is that

61
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:02,669
this is an isenthalpic,

62
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:05,149
an isenthalpic process.

63
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,229
What does it look like?

64
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:07,709
So in order for this to be

65
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,830
an isenthalpic process,
it means, right,

66
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,389
we don't have any
heat transfer,

67
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:13,709
we don't have any
work transfer.

68
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:14,830
So work transfer is

69
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,110
pretty straightforward,
right?

70
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,030
We have a control volume

71
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,549
that has constant volume,

72
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,950
nothing spinning in
there to transfer work.

73
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,750
To make it be adiabatic,

74
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,030
so basically no
heat transfer,

75
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,870
what do you think
you would do?

76
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,680
Insulated?
Insulated. Yeah, you

77
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,640
basically insulate it
or make it very small.

78
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,600
So insulating make
it very small,

79
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,879
then makes it do that.

80
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,560
So these are typically
then, like, you know,

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,839
a very small orifice plate

82
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:47,280
that you would have
there or a porous plug.

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,400
But under these
conditions,

84
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,360
you can treat
the process as

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
isomthalic, okay?

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,879
And that temperature
decrease

87
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,320
effect, if you want
to read about that,

88
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,600
that's the so called Jewel

89
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,280
Thompson Jewel
Thompson effect.

90
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,240
So when you get
a big expansion,

91
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,720
then in the fluid, there's

92
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,360
a corresponding cooling
that goes with it.

93
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,160
Okay? So what does
it look like if

94
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,039
you were to try
to represent

95
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,080
this on a diagrams?

96
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,200
Remember we talked
before about All right,

97
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,719
PV diagrams, a lot
of PV diagrams.

98
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,080
For air conditioning
processes

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,280
or refrigerator
stuff there,

100
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,240
it's also common to see
this represented on

101
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,359
a so called pressure
pH diagram or

102
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,120
pressure enthalpy
diagram, right?

103
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,119
So, this would be
like the entrance,

104
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,440
you know, out of the
condenser, right?

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,520
So you're a
saturated liquid

106
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,680
at some higher pressure,

107
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,480
and then you have a
nice enthalpic process

108
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,920
which then reduces
your pressure,

109
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,879
keeps these specific
enthalpy constant,

110
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,320
and you end up
here, right?

111
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,520
So you go from
essentially being

112
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,760
a saturated liquid to

113
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,225
something that's
a mixture, right?

114
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,930
So you get it there.

115
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,169
Alright, so
we'll go through

116
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,689
that example of what
that looks like.

117
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,450
And again, this
is only then

118
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,010
one leg of what
otherwise would

119
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,650
be what otherwise
would be a cycle,

120
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,010
right, a cycle there.

121
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,449
So the refrigerator
we're working

122
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,740
with in this is R 134 A.

123
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,789
Okay. You'll see R is
like a designation.

124
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,430
R just means
refrigerant, right?

125
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,950
So C R 134 A. Pi color
can handle this.

126
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,229
Your book tables also have

127
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:17,829
this tabulated
there, okay?

128
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,990
And to be consistent

129
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,509
with the notation
that I had before,

130
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,550
so the process we
want to analyze

131
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,949
is this three to four,

132
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,549
which we call as
throttling, okay?

133
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,149
Um, right?

134
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,390
So that's what we're

135
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,909
doing. So we
have our fluid.

136
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,510
We're looking
at throttling.

137
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,110
We know that we have
P three defined,

138
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,349
and we also have
X three, right?

139
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:50,829
Let's see. So based

140
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,389
on that, right,
we know it.

141
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:53,229
What is X three,

142
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,389
based on what I
showed you there?

143
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,429
Numerically is a value.

144
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,389
It could only be 0-1.

145
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,189
So I guess that's a lot

146
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:04,029
of numbers that
it could be,

147
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,950
or it could be very few.

148
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,690
It's not one. Zero.
Okay. Why is it zero?

149
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,490
Saturated liquid, right?

150
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,689
It's a saturated liquid.

151
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,970
It comes out of
a condenser.

152
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,729
A condenser
condenses, right?

153
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,609
And so you basically leave

154
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:24,530
as a saturated liquid
out of your condenser.

155
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,410
And, you have this P
three as a pressure.

156
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,809
This P three is
equal to P two

157
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:31,489
because that's out of
the compressor, right?

158
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:33,449
So there's no
pressure drop

159
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,289
across the heat
exchanger, right?

160
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,369
So with this, right,

161
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,929
we have complete
information.

162
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:41,099
We know, for
example, H three,

163
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,019
but we would also
know T three, right?

164
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,739
If you use Pi Klor
or your tables,

165
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,819
right, you could
look that up.

166
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:47,860
The other thing that's

167
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,859
given in this problem is

168
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:51,299
we're told that
we know P four.

169
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:52,660
So we know the pressure

170
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,539
that's what we
call downstream,

171
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,299
basically after
the device, right?

172
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,740
So if we were to
analyze this,

173
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,899
so if I just looked only

174
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,699
at the throttling process.

175
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,699
So let's say I
have something

176
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,419
here with a
very tiny hole.

177
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:08,979
This is then let's say

178
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,299
upstream in state three.

179
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,979
Our fluids flowing
in like that.

180
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,619
And basically
downstream, we have

181
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:20,869
um basically have
state four, okay?

182
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:22,630
And the control
volume that we're

183
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,589
interested in analyzing
here is then around,

184
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:32,269
right around this
throttling device, okay?

185
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,189
Our assumptions that
we had before, right,

186
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:36,389
is that we had no right?

187
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,229
We have no heat
transfer, okay?

188
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,429
We call it adiabatic,

189
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:45,509
and there's no work
transfer, right?

190
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:50,569
So we have no work
transfer here, okay?

191
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,050
And it's a steady
flow device,

192
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,849
so we can look right

193
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,169
our two conservation
equations,

194
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,369
our conservation
of mass and

195
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:56,969
our conservation
of energy.

196
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:00,129
So this is our CV or
control volume, right?

197
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,250
So the DM CV,

198
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,609
dt is equal to m.in
minus Rm dot out.

199
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:08,489
And the same then

200
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:09,689
for the change
in the energy

201
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,730
of our control
volume is equal to

202
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:17,129
e.in minus R E dot out.

203
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:21,930
We're going to assume
that this is steady.

204
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,289
Basically, it's a steady,

205
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,330
a steady flow here.

206
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,650
Okay, so it's not
So a steady flow.

207
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,089
So in this case,
right, this

208
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,730
is going to be
going to zero,

209
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,409
and then this basically
goes to zero, right?

210
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,930
And so what this
means is that m.in,

211
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,409
m.in is equal
to M dot out,

212
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,329
and I'm just going
to call this

213
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,329
as dot, right?

214
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,450
And this implies that e.in

215
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,729
is equal to E dot out.

216
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,010
So what's another
assumption

217
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,969
you think we're
going to have here?

218
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,529
Before I start writing
the energy equation.

219
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,289
Exactly. So we're
going to be

220
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:09,979
neglecting neglect,
KE and PE.

221
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,140
So we're going to neglect

222
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,259
kinetic and potential
energies, right?

223
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,939
So if we write our
energy equation, right?

224
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:19,579
So building on
that, so our e.in,

225
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,579
so the ways that we can

226
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,899
transfer energy in, right?

227
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:30,499
We're going to have W
in plus q.in plus m.in,

228
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:32,780
which I'm just going to
call as m dot, right?

229
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,300
And then this would be
times, in our case,

230
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,740
H three plus, right,

231
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,060
we'd have W
three, which is

232
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,854
our velocity
squared by two.

233
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:47,530
Plus GZ three,
and that's equal

234
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,210
to our W dot out plus Q

235
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,650
dot out plus dot

236
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,810
times H four plus

237
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,090
W four squared
divided by two,

238
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,890
again, velocity plus G,

239
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,889
which is the acceleration
due to gravity,

240
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:05,530
Z four there, okay?

241
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,649
So we're neglecting

242
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,090
kinetic and
potential energies.

243
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,690
SC, sac, sac, sac, gone.

244
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,730
We said it was
adiabatic, gone, gone.

245
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,650
And we said no work
transfer, gone and gone.

246
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,400
Okay? All right.

247
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,160
And these m.in and the M

248
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,920
dot out are both dots.

249
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,600
So that means that gone
and gone. All right?

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,960
So from this, what
you see is that H

251
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,215
three is equal to
H four, all right?

252
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:40,470
Ice, fall, big, okay?

253
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,389
And isobaric, isothermal.

254
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,390
Here's another ISO, okay?

255
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,790
I think there's also
a defense that's ISO.

256
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,069
I don't know how
that works, though.

257
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,150
All right?

258
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,709
Cool. All right,
that's basketball.

259
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,230
Yeah, exactly. You
go ISO on someone.

260
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,430
Alright, so basically
a three is a four,

261
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,269
and that's your omthopic.

262
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,750
And we can use
this, right?

263
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,720
So if we look
at our Right,

264
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,520
if we look at the
board here, right?

265
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,200
So we know our
upstream condition.

266
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
We knew P four,

267
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,640
but we needed one
other piece of

268
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,160
information to

269
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,720
determine the
downstream state,

270
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,200
okay?

271
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,120
And so by knowing that
H three is H four,

272
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,010
our state four Right?

273
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,170
We now know our P,

274
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,090
we basically know P four,

275
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,050
and we now know
that H four

276
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,290
is equal to H
three, right?

277
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,050
So essentially from this,

278
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,530
right, we have
complete information.

279
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,850
We can then
determine things

280
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,170
like T four, right?

281
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,330
T four there, okay,

282
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,009
which is what we're
interested in.

283
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,170
Remember what
I said to the

284
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,334
whole point of, um,

285
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:51,660
right of this device
here is that we want

286
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,740
to get this thing ready to

287
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,700
evaporate right at
a cold temperature.

288
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,299
So through this
throttling process,

289
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,980
we're able to drop
the temperature.

290
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,940
So again, by having
this date with T four,

291
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,300
right,

292
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,139
we're going to determine,
right, essentially,

293
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,460
Delta T is then
equal to our T

294
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,860
three minus R T four.

295
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,540
Okay. Great. What else?

296
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,880
Um Yes.

297
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,000
So just to give you some
values that we have.

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,720
I mean, I know
you can see it's

299
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,960
roughly on the board here.

300
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,080
But I'm going just write
this as state one.

301
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,295
So with our state one,

302
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:33,830
What I have is I
have P one here,

303
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:40,590
which is equal to
0.14 MPA, okay?

304
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,030
And I have a Oh,

305
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,510
I'm sorry, I
don't want T one.

306
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,350
Apologies. I
don't want T one.

307
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,870
What I want is
give me a second.

308
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,310
Apologies. I want
state three, right?

309
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,330
So for our state three,

310
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,550
S three pressure
for, like,

311
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,310
basically these pretty

312
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,229
realistic operating
conditions,

313
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:05,989
we have 0.8 MPA.

314
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:07,390
That's about eight times

315
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,069
atmospheric pressure.

316
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:12,670
Eight bar and,
you know, there.

317
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,390
So that's basically

318
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,829
a pretty reasonable
pressure.

319
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:16,590
And then, as I mentioned
before, X three,

320
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,070
as you all pointed out,

321
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,430
was then equal to zero.

322
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,470
So those are values
that we had.

323
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,829
The P four that
we have here.

324
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:25,990
So the pressure drop

325
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,030
that you experience across

326
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,389
the throttling device
is then 0.15 MPA.

327
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,069
Okay, so about 1.5

328
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:37,320
times atmospheric
pressure. All right.

329
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,680
A typical flow rate
that's then given here,

330
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,080
which is also given
into the problem

331
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,600
is that we have
an M dot here.

332
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,920
So this M dot
get rid of that.

333
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,000
So the M dot that
we have here is

334
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,439
equal to 0.05
kilograms/second.

335
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,520
Remember, the MDOT in
is the M dot out is

336
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,000
the M dot, there, okay?

337
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,320
And so if we use all of

338
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,960
this and we determine
our states,

339
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,840
what you'll have is
then a Delta T here.

340
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,320
So a cooling, pretty
significant cooling of

341
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,280
about 48 degrees Kelvin,

342
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,480
right, which is
also because

343
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,800
it's a Delta, right?

344
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,960
It's 48 degrees
Celsius, right?

345
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,319
That's how much
of a temperature

346
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:17,240
change you're
going to have from

347
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,520
this state here down to

348
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,935
this state this
state here, okay?

349
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,990
Because we have
complete information,

350
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,109
we can also
determine things

351
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,310
like specific
volume, right?

352
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,870
So we can have
V three here,

353
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,710
and we can have
V four, okay?

354
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,230
And so if we go then
with the Delta V as

355
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,550
being V three
minus RV four,

356
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,070
this is then
going to be equal

357
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,669
to a negative 0.040

358
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:49,790
9 meters cubed
per kilogram.

359
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,430
Why is it negative?

360
00:13:51,430 --> 00:14:00,740
It's Yes, please. Okay?

361
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,819
Decreases.

362
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:05,019
So it decreases,
but what decreases?

363
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,380
Yeah, so your
specific vome,

364
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,820
what does it mean?

365
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,339
Are you more like

366
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:11,379
a liquid or
you're more like

367
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,220
a vapor when the
Delta V is negative.

368
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,700
You're more like
a vapor, right?

369
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,820
You're basically,
again, you're getting

370
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,940
ready to evaporate.

371
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,260
And that also makes
sense because

372
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,860
if you were to analyze
the process here,

373
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,500
we end up somewhere
below the dome, right?

374
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,299
So you're
intermediate between,

375
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,420
you know, you're no

376
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,700
longer just a
liquid, right?

377
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,659
You're somewhere
between the liquid

378
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,220
and the vapor
and the liquid.

379
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,500
And when you're a
vapor, you have

380
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,539
a higher specific volume

381
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,540
than when you're
a liquid, okay?

382
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,900
All right? We
can also look

383
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
at the pressure drops.

384
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,379
I mean, obviously, we
have we would know

385
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,340
that from the beginning
because it was given.

386
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,060
But yeah, you're
going to have

387
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,500
something like
a seven bar,

388
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,380
seven bar of a
pressure drop.

389
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,819
And you can also compare.
It's instructive.

390
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:53,740
If you go back and look at

391
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,739
the definition of enthalpy

392
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:56,860
and actually what's
going on here.

393
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,660
It's instructive to
look at the difference

394
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,460
in internal energy, right?

395
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,920
So U three, um,
minus U four,

396
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,839
and that's equal to 5.587

397
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,920
kilojoules per
kilogram, right?

398
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,120
So if we think
about enthalpy,

399
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,360
so the enthalpy
doesn't change.

400
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,759
Enthalpy is by definition,

401
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,000
U plus is enthalpy
is U plus,

402
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,280
um, uh, PV, right?

403
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,520
So here, it says to
be a constant value.

404
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,720
So here what I'm telling
you, is that right,

405
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
the internal
energy at State

406
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,920
four is essentially less,

407
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,640
right, than the
internal energy

408
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,040
at State three, okay?

409
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,080
And so what do you

410
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,440
think is the
consequence of that?

411
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,759
If I have less internal

412
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,280
energy downstream
than I have upstream,

413
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,760
what do you think a
consequence of that is?

414
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,159
Temperature, right?
So the whole point

415
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,280
is that that's where
you see it, right?

416
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,080
Because, you know,
the P, right?

417
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,280
So downstream, the
pressure goes down.

418
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,720
The specific volume is
basically going up.

419
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,240
But the net effect

420
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,120
here is that the
internal energy is down,

421
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,360
right?

422
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,720
All of these things
work together to

423
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,440
keep this as a
constant value.

424
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
But the thing you
care about is that

425
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,559
the internal energy,
essentially,

426
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,720
you know, the temperature,

427
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,440
as you see it here,

428
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,880
decreases when you drop

429
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
across that device, okay?

430
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,319
So it's a humble device,

431
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,320
but it's an important
device, okay?

432
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,040
Right? 50% of the
electricity consumption

433
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,360
in this country
looks like that in

434
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,720
the summer, right?

435
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,839
Okay. Yes, please?

436
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,080
So it's interesting.
Where do you

437
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,800
see on this device

438
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,000
the temperature
being raised?

439
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,680
And so my reply
would be a question.

440
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,920
What's one way that
you think that

441
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,439
could happen
through a valve?

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,120
I mean, one way is

443
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,359
you just have a lot
of friction, right?

444
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,760
If I want to warm
something up, that's

445
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,119
pretty easy Actually
what's much more

446
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,480
challenging
usually is to cool

447
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,039
something down.
Other questions?

448
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,740
All clear? Great. I
love the thumbs up.

449
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,539
I appreciate feedback
from the crowd.

450
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,379
Okay. Yeah, so

451
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:18,659
we're going to do a
lot more with this.

452
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:20,859
We'll get more into that.

453
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,219
If you want to see
what throttling

454
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,419
looks like, this
is like a video.

455
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:24,859
So in this experiment,

456
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,980
what you're going
to see is upstream,

457
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,700
I have very high pressure.

458
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,540
I have a high
pressure refrigerant.

459
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,299
This refrigerant
is not R 134 A.

460
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,699
This refrigerant is
carbon dioxide, okay?

461
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:39,805
And what I'm doing is
I have a very tiny,

462
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:42,469
hole in it's orifice
plate, right?

463
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:43,949
Like I mentioned here,
it's a couple of

464
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,469
millimeters or a
millimeter or so,

465
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:47,910
I think, in diameter.

466
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,989
And then to the
right here,

467
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:50,189
this is open air, right?

468
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:51,829
So basically
low pressure is

469
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:54,869
about 1 bar, okay?

470
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,109
So I have something
that's like, you know,

471
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,270
40 or 50 times
atmospheric pressure

472
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,749
going to something
that's like one,

473
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:01,389
you know,

474
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:03,350
which is basically
atmospheric pressure.

475
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,789
And what you'll
see, right,

476
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,829
is essentially
you get like

477
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:10,069
a condensed phase
that's there, okay?

478
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,269
And it's very cold, right?

479
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:13,069
So if you put basically

480
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:14,229
a thermocouple in there,

481
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:17,509
it would be very
cold. Um, Yeah.

482
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:18,910
Has anyone ever seen

483
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,509
an experiment like
that done before?

484
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:24,950
Have you ever seen a
fire extinguisher?

485
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,309
That's what it is, right?

486
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,189
A fire extinguisher is
the same principle.

487
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,790
I have high pressure
carbon dioxide

488
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,350
that's there
in the bottle,

489
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,829
and I relieve it, right?

490
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,830
So I get a big cooling
effect that expansion,

491
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,830
so called Jewel
Thompson effect there.

492
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,389
So it lowers the
temperature a lot.

493
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,590
And for the case
of the fire,

494
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,750
and it lowers it
really a lot.

495
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,789
Like the temperature here,

496
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,870
you see this frost.

497
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,549
Like this is so

498
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:46,709
cold that I have,
like, you know,

499
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,789
very thick layer of ice
that's forming on it.

500
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:51,509
This will basically
go down to, like,

501
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,650
-70 Celsius,

502
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,489
which is essentially

503
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:55,529
the temperature
of dry ice.

504
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:56,890
That's also why you
never pick up dry ice

505
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,130
with your hands
because you will burn.

506
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,689
I mean, it will not feel

507
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,649
very pleasant to you.

508
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:04,290
So, this can basically
get very, very cold,

509
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,169
so that can help
with, you know,

510
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:07,290
from a temperature effect

511
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,249
of putting a fire out.

512
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:09,889
But the second part is,
obviously, you just

513
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,929
extinguish you
suffocate, right?

514
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:15,209
Don't allow any oxygen
to go to it, okay?

515
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:19,790
Cool. All right, so
that's throttling.

516
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,790
Continuing with the
device that I presented.

517
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,149
What I want to go
through now is

518
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:27,389
the heat exchanger
component of the device.

519
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:29,670
Not exactly the
same conditions,

520
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,509
as I said, for

521
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:33,510
running the
refrigeration cycle,

522
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,710
but it's going
to be helpful.

523
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,990
I'm going to show
you some of the tips

524
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,069
and tricks then
that we use

525
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:39,550
then for analyzing
a heat exchanger.

526
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,589
Let me just
erase the board.

527
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:42,829
Okay.

528
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,810
Cool. So what do we have?

529
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,089
So we have here,
R 134 A, again,

530
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:14,969
which is a common
refrigerant.

531
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:17,049
We're entering, right?

532
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,689
So we have R 134
A again, 134 A.

533
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:27,209
We have an M
dot of R 134 A,

534
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:30,170
R 134 A, which is

535
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:36,409
equal to 6
kilograms/minute.

536
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:41,370
Um It enters as a vapor.

537
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,130
So when we look
at the R 134,

538
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:44,889
I think we'll wait for

539
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:45,729
the properties
in a second.

540
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:47,329
We we neglect pressure
drops in that.

541
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,929
Let's start talking
about some states.

542
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,649
So if I have state three

543
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,529
as it's defined
here, okay?

544
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,650
One piece of
information that

545
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,169
I see with state three.

546
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,350
So it enters as a vapor.

547
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,049
Vapor, but it doesn't
say saturated vapor.

548
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:06,929
And the other part that I

549
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,129
see here is for
state three,

550
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:09,650
I'm giving two pieces
of information.

551
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,730
So I can put this

552
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,930
in and determine
properties.

553
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,529
The thing you need
to check, right,

554
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:15,449
when you do that
analysis is that this

555
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:18,489
is actually a
vapor, right?

556
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:19,849
You can see what
type of vapor

557
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:23,050
that that it is.

558
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,529
If it's a
superheated vapor,

559
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:25,489
this is enough
information.

560
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:27,449
It could also be with
these conditions that

561
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:29,770
it's also a
saturated vapor.

562
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,369
What I'm going to

563
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:31,329
assume based on
this is that

564
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:34,650
it's a superheated vapor.

565
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,369
So we have a T
there, T three,

566
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:38,689
which is 70 degrees C,

567
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:40,889
and I have a P
three, which is then

568
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:44,340
equal to 1 megapascal.

569
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,499
Okay? All right. And
presumably with this,

570
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:49,139
we have subject to
verification, right?

571
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:50,459
We have basically enthal P

572
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:53,299
three, which
we care about.

573
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,339
Okay? Now we exit, right?

574
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:57,899
We exit from here
to state four.

575
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,499
All right. And
in state four,

576
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:01,940
we're only given
the temperature.

577
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,980
So we have T four,
which is 35 degrees

578
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,140
C. And what we're

579
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,180
told is that
it's sub cooled.

580
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,539
So basically,
we're told sub

581
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:20,400
cooled um liquid.

582
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,159
What do you think we
do here? What would

583
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,879
be like your
first reaction?

584
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:25,720
I'm told this temperature

585
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,199
and I'm told
subcooled liquid,

586
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:27,839
what would you do with

587
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,559
this information if you

588
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,279
wanted to get a property?

589
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,999
X equals zero,
right? Yeah.

590
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:37,639
So essentially, for now,

591
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:40,399
we'll start with
and say X four

592
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:44,949
is equal to zero, okay?

593
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:46,099
All right, so,

594
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,499
essentially what
you're saying is that

595
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,340
the properties
of the liquid

596
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,819
when it's sub
cooled to this

597
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:55,459
are not very different to

598
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,500
the state when it's

599
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,020
a saturated liquid, right?

600
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,259
And if you read the
textbook, old school,

601
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:02,819
like if you went
to the tables

602
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:04,540
the property
tables in a book,

603
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,260
this information
would normally

604
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,979
not be given, right?

605
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:09,059
You would not have

606
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,820
subcooled liquid
properties,

607
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,460
which you'd be given
as essentially

608
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,460
a saturated liquid.

609
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,780
What is the other
thing that I

610
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,804
said about a heat
exchanger, though?

611
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:23,229
At the beginning.
What property

612
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:24,670
doesn't change
across the heat

613
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,429
exchanger in this class?

614
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:28,990
Pressure, right? So
the other way to

615
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,950
look at this would
just be to say,

616
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,149
so that's an
approximation.

617
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,269
Another way to
look at this is

618
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:35,149
to say that I'm
going to go with

619
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:38,829
my pressure and say that P

620
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,919
four is equal then

621
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,039
to P three. And it
is instructive.

622
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,279
I won't do it
now, but it's

623
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,440
instructive for you
to compare the values

624
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,159
when you do T

625
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,839
four and X four equals
zero and determine

626
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:57,719
H four or to do T four and

627
00:23:57,719 --> 00:24:00,839
P four equals to P

628
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,679
three and also determine
an H four, okay?

629
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,200
What you see is
that they're

630
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,719
not that different, okay?

631
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,640
All right. That's
very good.

632
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,879
So we have this
with State three.

633
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:17,200
We basically have
two approaches

634
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,679
when we look at

635
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,519
State four and on

636
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,959
an exam or something
like that.

637
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,120
Again, as long as
you justify for me,

638
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,679
I thought this,
I did this,

639
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,479
that's perfectly
acceptable, okay?

640
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,679
So if you look at
this and you make

641
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,519
a judgment call that
this is the right way,

642
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,559
do that, but
write that, okay?

643
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,949
Give me a reason.
All right.

644
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:37,149
So those are State
three and State four.

645
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,909
I'm pretty sure
we have that

646
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:40,790
done also with the
mass flow rate.

647
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,389
I feel pretty
comfortable with that.

648
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:43,470
We're going to
be able with

649
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,790
that to determine
then the heat

650
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,670
transferred out of
the refrigerant.

651
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,069
Let's focus for
a second now at

652
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:51,029
state at state one.

653
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:55,159
So if we go to
state One here.

654
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,360
All right. So
we have water.

655
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
That's at T one and equal

656
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,920
to 15 degrees Celsius.

657
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,959
And we're told that
P one is equal to

658
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:13,760
300 pa so three times
atmospheric pressure.

659
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,959
And then at state.
And so with this,

660
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,839
it's very likely there

661
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,840
is a pretty high pressure.

662
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,599
It's a pretty
low temperature.

663
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,279
With this, you're going

664
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,799
to be able to have H one.

665
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,279
It's going to be like

666
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,479
a subcooled liquid there.

667
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,839
You're going to be
able to get H one.

668
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,449
And then for state
two, All right,

669
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,809
State two. All right.

670
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,169
What we have there is
we have T two is equal

671
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,210
to 25 degrees

672
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,609
C. And what's the
other property?

673
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,329
Pressure.
Pressure is what?

674
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,809
Thank you, Kai.
Okay. So then

675
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:54,449
P two is then
equal to P one,

676
00:25:54,449 --> 00:26:03,719
which is equal to
300 pa. All right.

677
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:06,679
P two, P two.

678
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:09,200
Let me just check
my assumptions

679
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,639
here. Yeah, so
this is good.

680
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,199
I have that.
You have T two,

681
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,479
right? So that's
getting warmer.

682
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,799
That makes sense.
So this all

683
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,000
looks good to me.

684
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,639
Let me just check on
my refrigeration side.

685
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:24,359
T three, which
was 70, P three,

686
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,799
which is one MPA, T
four. Yeah. So in my.

687
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,320
So again, this is

688
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,839
one way that you
can do it in my,

689
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,610
um, In my solution

690
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,089
that you can
launch from there,

691
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:38,730
I've gone this way, right?

692
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,649
So I've assumed
that it's isoberic.

693
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:41,810
So the pressure three

694
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,369
that's given is equal
to pressure four,

695
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,649
and I've gone with T four

696
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,409
to determine H four.

697
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:47,769
If you want to do
it old school,

698
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:49,049
and by the book, you have

699
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,369
to remember this
trick, right?

700
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:55,009
So this is book, okay?

701
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:59,689
And then this is
Pi Klor, okay.

702
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,570
All right, so
we got a handle

703
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,650
on the states now, right?

704
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,009
So from this, right,

705
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,209
I'm going to be
able to have H two.

706
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:15,570
And so what we've

707
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,569
got to know is
we want to know

708
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,209
the mass flow rate of

709
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:20,209
the cooling water and

710
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:21,329
the heat transfer
rate from

711
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:25,169
the refrigerant to
the water, all right?

712
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:27,369
So now, again, I'm not
going to, you know,

713
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:28,450
what I have drawn there in

714
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,769
the control volume is

715
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:30,689
right, the entire thing.

716
00:27:30,689 --> 00:27:31,970
What I'd like to
do at the moment

717
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,449
now is to break that down

718
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,409
into two separate control

719
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:36,969
volumes, which I'll do.

720
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:40,609
So let me do my best

721
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:45,649
to draw a serpentine pipe.

722
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:48,850
Okay. That's horrible.

723
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:55,289
Okay. All right.

724
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:58,650
So, so into the pipe here,

725
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,809
we have state
three coming in.

726
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:03,370
We have State
four exiting,

727
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,449
and I'm drawing my
control volume exactly

728
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:11,129
around the pipe.
All right.

729
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,204
Okay.

730
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:18,039
Let's call this, for
example, CV 34, okay?

731
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,679
All right, CV 34

732
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,359
corresponding to
the states, right?

733
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,760
We can write our
conservation equations,

734
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:24,959
right?

735
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:28,319
So the rate of
change of mass in

736
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,680
CV 34 dt is equal to

737
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:41,599
m.in minus M dot
out of CV 34. Okay.

738
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,119
We're going to
assume, right,

739
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,479
this is a steady
flow device.

740
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:48,519
So if we assume it's
a steady flow, well,

741
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,679
we can call then.in of

742
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,840
CV 34 is equal to M
dot out of CV 34.

743
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,839
And what I would like to

744
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,630
call that is just m.r1,

745
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,229
three, four, A, okay?

746
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:08,669
So we're good
there, right?

747
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:10,550
Now we're going to write
our energy equation,

748
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,669
the same thing, right?

749
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:17,349
So D E, CV, three, four,

750
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:27,590
dt is equal to e.in minus
E dot out of CV 34.

751
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,589
Steady flow. This
is gone, right?

752
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:31,469
So what comes
in here is to

753
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,989
equal to what exits, okay?

754
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:38,850
Um, So we can write that.

755
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,730
So what enters energy

756
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,089
can be carried in
from work, right?

757
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:51,199
So I can have w dot
plus q.in plus dot, um,

758
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,719
dot R one, three,

759
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:57,799
four A times three plus

760
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,119
w squared divided by
two plus G three,

761
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,039
and that's equal
to W dot out.

762
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,919
Okay, plus Q
dot out plus.r1

763
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,039
34ah four plus velocity

764
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,560
four squared divided by

765
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,520
two plus the
potential energy

766
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,279
at state four, right?

767
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,839
Okay, what are we
going to neglect here?

768
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:36,940
Neglect KE and PE.

769
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,220
So this means gone,

770
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,780
gone, gone, and gone.

771
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,979
All right. One.
What about work?

772
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
Do you see
anything spinning?

773
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,000
No, right? So there's

774
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,399
no work transfer
here, no work.

775
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,239
Okay. Well, yeah,
no shaft work here,

776
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,599
right? So we
have no shaft.

777
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,839
Let me see there
no shaft work.

778
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,719
All right. All right.

779
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:09,399
So these are gone.
And what about heat?

780
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:12,360
Do we have any heat
transferred in or heat

781
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,500
transferred out 3-4? Loud.

782
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,619
N and loud here.

783
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:21,579
This side of the room.

784
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,299
Someone not
named Kai? Okay.

785
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,940
Cody.

786
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,979
If you transfer
it out, right?

787
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:29,579
So basically, we
don't have it in,

788
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:30,659
and we have it
out right because

789
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:31,939
the temperature
is lower, right?

790
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:34,019
So we can do then
from this is we

791
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,459
can determine that
our Q dot out, right?

792
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,779
So the heat
transfer rate from

793
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,700
the refrigerant to
the water then here.

794
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,499
So Q dot out is
equal to m.r1 34 A,

795
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,779
which is given
times H three,

796
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,339
which we know minus
H four, okay?

797
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:51,739
So basically
we've answered

798
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:54,379
part B already there.

799
00:31:54,379 --> 00:32:03,779
So this is good. So
answer Good. All right.

800
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,499
All right, now let's draw

801
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:11,300
our control volume
in for our water.

802
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,859
So if we look
at the water,

803
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:16,860
okay. There's the water.

804
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,939
Okay, I have it
coming in here,

805
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:27,289
right? And out here.

806
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:30,249
So this is state
state one here.

807
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:33,009
We have state two here.

808
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:34,890
Let's draw control volume.

809
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,529
So here's the
control volume that

810
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:39,289
I am going to

811
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:40,969
attempt to draw because

812
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,290
it's going to
get complicated.

813
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,890
So the other point is
that I have this pipe,

814
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:51,070
this serpentine pipe,
which is right.

815
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,409
Okay, which is
going there.

816
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,290
And so when I draw
this control volume,

817
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,329
I want to draw around
this pipe, right?

818
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:02,769
I only want to have
the parts that

819
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:06,129
are that are water
there, okay?

820
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:09,849
Difficult to represent
in two dimensions.

821
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:11,809
This is kind of
a mess, okay?

822
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:15,609
So, you know, basically,

823
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,450
everything but the
pipe here is what I'm

824
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,609
drawing the
control volume of.

825
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:20,969
Right? The same
thing, right?

826
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:23,049
So conservation of
mass, it's steady.

827
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:24,449
So we have, right,

828
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:28,609
m.in is equal
to M dot out.

829
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,490
Rate of h2o.

830
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,129
Or let's say we can call

831
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,450
this then as CV 12
to be consistent.

832
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,490
So CV one, two, CV 12.

833
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,969
And what I would
like to just call

834
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:44,009
this is maybe.h2o, right?

835
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:45,489
So that's the
mass flow rate of

836
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:46,329
the cooling water, which

837
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:47,289
is what we're trying
to determine.

838
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,609
So that's one conservation
of energy, right?

839
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:52,010
So we neglect kinetic
and potential energies.

840
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,770
We have no work transfer.

841
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,289
So what we'll
have then is for

842
00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:00,169
the energy transferred
in, right?

843
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:04,169
So we'll have
q.in plus.h2o.

844
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,049
What's the inlet?
The inlet is H one.

845
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:10,490
Okay, and that's
equal to It's Q dot,

846
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,609
Q dot out plus m dot O.

847
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:17,049
All right. And then that's

848
00:34:17,049 --> 00:34:19,090
the enthalpy
that's leaving,

849
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,569
right? That's two, right?

850
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:22,730
So I don't have
work, no kinetic,

851
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,050
no potential energy.

852
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,249
And now we have to
deal with the heat.

853
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:28,209
So do we have q.in
or Q dot out here?

854
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:35,499
Say it again.
Q.in your name?

855
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,579
Had Hayden, q.in, right?

856
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:38,859
So we don't
have Q dot out.

857
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:39,940
We have heap transferred

858
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,619
that makes sense, right?

859
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,899
The water is leaving
hotter than here.

860
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,259
What's the other
assumption

861
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:46,579
for this whole
analysis to work?

862
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:48,099
What's the other
assumption I have to

863
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,500
make about my water
control volume?

864
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,739
So I'm saying that
there's q.in, right?

865
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,099
But q.in could come
from the refrigerant,

866
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:01,859
but it could also come

867
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:02,979
from the
environment, right?

868
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:04,460
So what's the
other assumption

869
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,899
I need to make?

870
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,550
It's insulated.

871
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,909
Basically it's
adiabatic, right?

872
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,669
So basically on the
outside of this, right?

873
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:19,949
So we assume that this is,

874
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:22,669
this is basically
an insulated

875
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:27,229
thermally insulated
there, okay?

876
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:28,749
So we do have q.in, but

877
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:30,309
it's not from the
surroundings, right?

878
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:32,509
So it's coming in
from from that.

879
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:36,469
So we have q.in
then is equal to

880
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:41,069
m.h2o times the enthalpy

881
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:43,029
at state two minus
the enthalpy

882
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:45,004
at state one, okay?

883
00:35:45,004 --> 00:35:47,019
All right. So if I want to

884
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,859
get to so I know H two,

885
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:50,819
I know one, okay?

886
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,980
I want to find dot HO.

887
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,219
I don't know q.in.

888
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,539
I do know all
of this, right?

889
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:01,139
So I know Q dot out.

890
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,700
What is, like, a matching

891
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,219
criteria you think has to

892
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:10,199
happen for this system
to work? Q plus.

893
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,199
That's it, right?

894
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,000
So basically, the q.in,

895
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,279
which I'll make it clear.

896
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:18,240
I'll call this
as q.in h2o,

897
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,759
must be equal to the Q dot

898
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:24,999
out of RR 134 A, right?

899
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:27,079
They what we
would call, what

900
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,119
I call this CV one, two,

901
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,199
right, is equal
to then, right,

902
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,039
the CV 34, okay?

903
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,200
So there's no energy

904
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,440
exchange with
the environment.

905
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,760
There's only
energy exchange

906
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,959
that's happening
within it,

907
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:41,039
heat exchanger. All right?

908
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,439
So the heat is
exchanged then.

909
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:46,359
If it's done right,
then within it.

910
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:47,959
Okay.

911
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,479
That's very good.

912
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:50,199
So if we set

913
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,839
these things equal
to each other,

914
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,599
so I'll have.h2o is
equal to I'm sorry.

915
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:03,319
So, sorry, sorry.
M.h2o times H

916
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:10,479
two minus H one is
equal to m.r1 34 a.

917
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,479
And that's times. So
where's our thing,

918
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:17,539
H three, minus R H four,

919
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,019
just do a sanity check.

920
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,299
So the cooling
water should

921
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:21,459
be hotter leaving, right?

922
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:22,739
So that enthalpy should

923
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,420
be greater than the inlet.

924
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,819
And the R 34 A

925
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,659
is entering hot and
getting colder, right?

926
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:29,980
So this enthalpy entering

927
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,859
will be greater than that.

928
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,980
Both these things then
are positive values.

929
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,579
And so if we
divide both sides

930
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:35,899
by H two minus H one,

931
00:37:35,899 --> 00:37:39,340
we're going to
have.h2o is equal

932
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,499
to.r1 34 a, okay?

933
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:45,519
And that's times H three,

934
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:47,939
minus H four, and that's

935
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:51,219
divided by H two
minus H one, okay?

936
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:53,299
And then that's the other

937
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:55,539
formula that we
need, right?

938
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,619
And we know all
this information.

939
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:58,019
We know one, two, three,

940
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:01,219
four, and the dot
is given, okay?

941
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:04,459
If you want some numbers
to put into this,

942
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:10,019
so for our Q dot out,

943
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:13,780
so essentially the heat

944
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,579
transfer rate from

945
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:15,699
the refrigerant
to the water.

946
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:17,859
If we substitute
our values here,

947
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:24,319
I have 21.3 kilowatts.

948
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:26,680
That's a pretty
substantial chiller.

949
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,599
So a 20 kilowatt
chiller is like,

950
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah, well, it's
like a $20,000

951
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,520
chiller. It's a
nice chiller.

952
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,919
Okay. So you have
you'd have that.

953
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:38,079
That, of course,
would be equal,

954
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,239
right to the q.in,
right, that we had.

955
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,719
The mass flow rate
of the water,

956
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,520
if you substitute
your numbers,

957
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,759
I have here as 0.49

958
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:58,559
basically 0.49
kilograms/second, okay?

959
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:07,089
Good. Yes, kilograms
per minute.

960
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:11,849
1 minute is 60.

961
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,369
Yeah. And one
thing that's kind

962
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:14,930
of instructive
here to compare

963
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,049
is actually the
values between this.

964
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:23,689
So the MO 134ar 134 a,

965
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:25,929
we said was equal to what?

966
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:29,649
Six kilg per minute,

967
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:32,970
1 minute and 60 seconds.

968
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:38,449
So what do I have here?
0.01 kilogram/second.

969
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:41,169
I So what's
interesting about

970
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:44,169
this is that the
enthalpy change, right?

971
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:45,329
So these things have
to be equal, right?

972
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,049
So the MDOT times the
enthalpy change in

973
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:48,649
the refrigerant is
the M dot times

974
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:50,329
the enthalpy change
in the water.

975
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:52,969
And an interesting
feature about

976
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,929
phase change processes is

977
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,609
the enthalpy changes
are massive, right?

978
00:39:56,609 --> 00:39:58,450
So we go from these
liquids to these vapors.

979
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,649
We have very big
changes, and

980
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:00,849
that's the whole
of them, right?

981
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:01,649
So the whole point of

982
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,640
a a vapor
compression cycle

983
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,079
in a refrigerator
is that you

984
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,520
condense a liquid and
you boil a liquid,

985
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,399
and the process of
going from one to the

986
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:13,040
other has a huge
change in enthalpy.

987
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,999
It has a lot of capacity
to absorb heat,

988
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,919
so you don't need to
pump a lot of it, right?

989
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:17,799
On the other hand,

990
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,439
something like
liquid water, right,

991
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:22,280
which we use a lot of
for cooling in systems,

992
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,119
because it's not
boiling or evaporating,

993
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,800
this is only sensible
heat transfer.

994
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,599
You're not going to have

995
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,039
a very large
enthalpy difference.

996
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,679
So it means you
got to crank up

997
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,399
the mass floor
and a lot more to

998
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,599
match the heat
transfer rate

999
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,479
that you're going
to have from

1000
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:37,479
the refrigeration
side, right?

1001
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,559
Um, If you think about,

1002
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,999
like an actual
refrigerator,

1003
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,519
the way that you get
this balance is a lot of

1004
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,119
times it's now with
an MDOT of water,

1005
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,319
and it's natural
convection of air.

1006
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,719
And so what you end up

1007
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,439
really needing is
actually very large.

1008
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:51,440
Maybe this section
where you pump,

1009
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,559
the fluid is small,

1010
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,919
but if you look in
the back of them,

1011
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,520
you're going to see
big, like, radiators

1012
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,679
or a lot of
metal that's on

1013
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,159
there to kind of
enhance the area

1014
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,279
such that you can
get a balance, okay?

1015
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:03,479
All clear? That's
heat exchangers.

1016
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:05,479
Another thumbs
up. Awesome.

1017
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:09,200
Okay. So I have 8 minutes.

1018
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,519
I think I'm doing
it off notes today.

1019
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,439
With notes. Okay. So
the last one I want

1020
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,639
to get into then and look

1021
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,439
at is a bit of
this unsteady.

1022
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:19,999
So this might be a moment
where I would say,

1023
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,809
like We're not going
to do a lot of

1024
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:26,089
practically probably
any unsteady

1025
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:28,609
flow processes
in the course.

1026
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:31,369
But it is interesting,
and I'll show you one,

1027
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:33,329
you know,
application of this.

1028
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:34,809
So one is, like,
here they show

1029
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:37,130
sort of charging
of a tank.

1030
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,569
I mean, one of the
ones that's, like,

1031
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:41,089
most relevant is
pump hydro, right?

1032
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:42,649
So if you think about
pump hydro and you

1033
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:43,369
want to store
something kind

1034
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:44,329
of like a battery, right?

1035
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:45,890
You're going to be
pumping some fluid,

1036
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,049
storing that as like a

1037
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,689
potential energy and
then bringing it back.

1038
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:52,009
That's like one, one
example of that.

1039
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,960
Here they have things
like charging a tank,

1040
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,910
In addition to,
like, pumped

1041
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,549
hydro, another
common way of,

1042
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,830
like, renewable
energy storage

1043
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,669
is essentially
this process,

1044
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:05,269
but imagine like a cavern
underground, right?

1045
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:07,029
So I have my renewable.

1046
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:08,389
I then take that air, I

1047
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:09,669
compress the heck
out of it in

1048
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,230
a huge geological feature

1049
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,789
underground,
compress that,

1050
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:14,109
and then later
on, I take that,

1051
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:16,710
and let's say I
run a turbine

1052
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,190
or something liquid.

1053
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,470
So these are
kind of examples

1054
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,309
of unsteady
flow processes.

1055
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:24,869
The way that we
do this, right?

1056
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:27,869
So I'll erase this

1057
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,419
is the same as

1058
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:31,499
we did the other
things, right?

1059
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:33,619
We have our conservation
of mass, okay,

1060
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,139
and we have our
conservation

1061
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:37,819
of energy, right?

1062
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,819
So it's pretty much
the same thing,

1063
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:40,619
but I'll show you

1064
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,099
kind of one
important difference

1065
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,180
of these devices compared

1066
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,580
to the way we were solving

1067
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,820
steady steady
flow devices.

1068
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,139
And then I'll
hopefully finish

1069
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:51,419
with at least getting

1070
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:53,139
started with an example.

1071
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:55,619
Mm, do do, do,

1072
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:06,049
do. Okay.

1073
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,849
All right, right. So
again, we have this.

1074
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:14,689
Let's say, you know,

1075
00:43:14,689 --> 00:43:16,169
we have our system there.

1076
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:20,009
Okay. Um, Let's
say, you know,

1077
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:23,209
we have some piston
cylinder type device,

1078
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:24,689
but with an opening, okay?

1079
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:25,809
So this thing is kind

1080
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:27,289
of like free to
move up or down.

1081
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:29,089
We have the control
volume here,

1082
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:31,489
where we can bring
mass now in or out.

1083
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,330
So that's kind of like
our piston cylinder,

1084
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,450
but now we can bring mass

1085
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,769
in from one
direction, right?

1086
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:39,249
So let's say here,
we're dealing with

1087
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,729
some amount of mass from

1088
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:43,489
the inlet that's
coming in.

1089
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:46,329
Okay? We can define
an initial state,

1090
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:49,369
which is then M M one.

1091
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:52,290
So we have M one of
this control volume,

1092
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,809
and then we have a final
state, which would

1093
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:55,609
be basically M two, right?

1094
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:58,104
So you're going to have
some change of mass.

1095
00:43:58,104 --> 00:44:01,760
Um, you know, in
this control volume,

1096
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,239
and that's going to
be equal, you know,

1097
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:05,160
just like our
thermal accounting,

1098
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,399
the mass that comes
from the inlet

1099
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:11,959
minus the mass from
the exit, okay?

1100
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:15,720
So that's basically our
conservation of mass.

1101
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,239
Of course, for
this problem,

1102
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,679
we don't have any,

1103
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,640
we don't have any exiting.

1104
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,480
If we look at the
change in the energy,

1105
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,079
so the change in

1106
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,279
the energy of
our system here.

1107
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:31,839
So the E let's
say, uh, you know,

1108
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,689
let's say E
Delta E, Right,

1109
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:39,169
CV is going to be

1110
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:41,209
equal to the
energy that enters

1111
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:46,769
minus the energy
that exits.

1112
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:48,769
Okay? The way that
this can enter is just

1113
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,849
like we had, right before.

1114
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:52,909
So you can have you know,

1115
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:56,630
W in plus our Q in plus,

1116
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,669
you know, M in, right?

1117
00:44:58,669 --> 00:45:01,869
So this could be M
in that M can carry

1118
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:06,229
some, some
enthalpy, right?

1119
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:09,949
That could carry some
kinetic energy, right?

1120
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:13,070
And that could also
come in from a height.

1121
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,669
Okay. So does that look,

1122
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,309
that looks
basically right.

1123
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:20,389
And then plus a negative,
the out, right?

1124
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:23,229
W out. Plus, you know,

1125
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:25,989
Q out plus, you know,

1126
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:29,429
out times the
enthalpy out,

1127
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:32,949
plus the velocity out
squared divided by

1128
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:37,709
two plus G, Z out, right?

1129
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:41,469
This is a minus
sign. Okay.

1130
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:45,549
Um, you know, and
again, the book, right?

1131
00:45:45,549 --> 00:45:47,469
The book tries
to sometimes

1132
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,269
make things more
convenient.

1133
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:50,990
So this enthalpy plus

1134
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,509
kinetic energy plus
potential energy.

1135
00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:57,150
The book we'll call,
right, as Theta.

1136
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,750
So you can call this
basically a Theta

1137
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,909
in if you wanted to,

1138
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:02,309
and then basically the
same thing here as

1139
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:06,869
a Theta as a Theta
out, right? Okay.

1140
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:13,500
Um, So what makes this
kind of impractical,

1141
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,259
okay, is that right?

1142
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:17,539
I just spent all
this time talking

1143
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:18,980
about steady flow devices.

1144
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,460
The steady flow devices

1145
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,659
dealt with rates
of something.

1146
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:23,939
So I have a
rate of, right,

1147
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:29,739
something that's coming
in and coming out.

1148
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:31,519
Um, right?

1149
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:33,839
And that's convenient.
In this case,

1150
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,720
I don't have
anything with rates.

1151
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,479
So I look at this,

1152
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:37,999
and I say, okay, there's
some final state,

1153
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:40,399
maybe it's totally
discharged

1154
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:42,479
is the final state.

1155
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:44,279
Or let's say something

1156
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:45,999
that's totally discharged
the initial state,

1157
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:49,280
and then I charge it
and it's fully primed.

1158
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,239
So I guess you could
go in and do that.

1159
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,039
And you could look at

1160
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:53,999
these things
and say, Okay,

1161
00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:55,359
that's how much
mass changed,

1162
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,520
and that's how much energy

1163
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,159
in the control
volume changed.

1164
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,669
Um, For, like, real
systems, though, like,

1165
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:05,549
the rate that I want
to bring mass in will

1166
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:07,349
probably depend on how

1167
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:08,709
pressurized
this is, right?

1168
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,269
So if I have a device here

1169
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:10,949
that can probably get

1170
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:12,389
something to a pressure.

1171
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:14,349
As I fill this more,

1172
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:15,949
the rate that
I fill it will

1173
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:17,629
probably be less, right?

1174
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:19,149
So you'll probably
end up having

1175
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:21,550
something, you
know, asymptotic.

1176
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,429
And analyzing
and figuring out

1177
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:25,550
those timescales of a
filling a compression

1178
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,909
or sort of decompression,

1179
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:28,989
that's kind of, like,
important, okay?

1180
00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:31,389
And this you know,

1181
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:33,109
approach that's here, you

1182
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:34,309
know, doesn't
totally get you.

1183
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,150
So if you want to analyze,

1184
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,909
you know, systems
that look,

1185
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:39,349
you know, again, like
I said, this one,

1186
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:41,390
you know, here with
the discharge,

1187
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,389
what you'll have
to do is to

1188
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:44,909
think about
these things in,

1189
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:46,389
like, little nuggets,

1190
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:48,069
like in little
steps, right?

1191
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:51,549
So I'll have a control
volume, okay? Right?

1192
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:52,790
I'll have some rate,

1193
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,189
maybe that I'm
bringing it in,

1194
00:47:54,189 --> 00:47:55,149
right, you know,

1195
00:47:55,149 --> 00:47:56,749
let's say there's
like an MI.

1196
00:47:56,749 --> 00:48:03,779
Let's see if there's an
M dot I trash. Right?

1197
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:05,819
So maybe I'll have
a rate, right,

1198
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,539
that I'm bringing, you

1199
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:09,619
know, something in, okay?

1200
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:11,739
And I'll have maybe

1201
00:48:11,739 --> 00:48:13,889
a new rate at

1202
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:16,449
something like an
I plus one, right?

1203
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:17,489
Or maybe another way

1204
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:18,529
of saying this
is that I have

1205
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,209
an M dot I at T,

1206
00:48:21,209 --> 00:48:26,609
and then I have an M dot
I at T plus Delta T.

1207
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:30,249
Okay? And so the way
that you can figure out,

1208
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,849
sort of, you know,

1209
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:36,009
how much mass you have
sort of in the vessel.

1210
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:39,489
So the mass that I
have here at time T,

1211
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:42,249
might be equal to some

1212
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:43,769
original mass
that I have in

1213
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:46,010
there plus the dot

1214
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,249
I times the delta
T. And again,

1215
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:49,009
if you're very interested

1216
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,049
in these things and
you want to see

1217
00:48:50,049 --> 00:48:51,979
how actually to
analyze this,

1218
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:53,619
which I want to ask
on, like, quizzes,

1219
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:55,339
you're going to do
a hybrid between

1220
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:57,139
an unsteady flow problem

1221
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,539
and a steady flow problem,

1222
00:48:58,539 --> 00:48:59,859
and you will
solve this what's

1223
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:01,539
called numerically, okay?

1224
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,619
So, you know, in
between each step,

1225
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:04,579
you'll have something
that's kind

1226
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:05,899
of like quasi equilibrium,

1227
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:07,019
so I fill it a little or

1228
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:08,459
I discharge a
little, right,

1229
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:09,939
to figure out
what my state is,

1230
00:49:09,939 --> 00:49:11,220
and then I go on
with the rest

1231
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,779
of my analysis.

1232
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:14,299
So in order to do this,
right, like I said,

1233
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:15,459
you're going to have
some version of

1234
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:16,779
some M dots there.

1235
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:18,754
You have to know,
like an initial mass.

1236
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:20,009
You have to know
sort of your

1237
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:21,369
initial states that
you start with.

1238
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:22,569
And if you go
on, like I said,

1239
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:23,689
kind of iteratively
with, like,

1240
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:25,249
Delta Ts, you know,

1241
00:49:25,249 --> 00:49:26,769
you can basically
analyze it, right?

1242
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:28,009
And again, in
the interest of

1243
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:29,249
time, I'll take
you through it.

1244
00:49:29,249 --> 00:49:30,569
So in this problem here,

1245
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:31,850
this would be
the experiment

1246
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:32,609
that I mentioned before.

1247
00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:32,849
So,

1248
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:34,529
let's say you have a
refrigeration system,

1249
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:35,889
there's a fire,
you need to

1250
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,329
evacuate this
whole thing, okay?

1251
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:39,010
And you got to
do it safely.

1252
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,449
So you have some volume
associated with it,

1253
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:43,090
some pressure, a fluid,

1254
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,889
a pressure, a quality.

1255
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:46,450
You have some heat that's

1256
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,849
coming in, let's
say, from the fire.

1257
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:49,489
For now, because I'm
not going to teach

1258
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,529
compressible
flow theory yet.

1259
00:49:51,529 --> 00:49:53,089
You'll have an MDOT,

1260
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,239
um you know,
with it, okay?

1261
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,479
And so, again, what you

1262
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,719
can end up with here
as you can see,

1263
00:49:57,719 --> 00:49:59,079
here's my mass flow rate.

1264
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,360
Here's the pressure drop

1265
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,079
that happens with this.

1266
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:02,920
Here's the change
in internal energy.

1267
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,359
And you could go on
and, you know, plot

1268
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:05,759
a process like that on

1269
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:07,479
a pH diagram of what

1270
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:09,479
a relief event
would look like.

1271
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:11,119
But this whole curve
that I produced

1272
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,199
is essentially
Little Delta Ts,

1273
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:14,879
doing a numerical
scheme like

1274
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:16,879
this to figure out
the changes, okay?

1275
00:50:16,879 --> 00:50:18,879
Alright, with that,
I'm going to stop.

1276
00:50:18,879 --> 00:50:20,879
If you have any
questions, I'm up here.

1277
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:23,439
Otherwise, on Wednesday,
we kick off with,

1278
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:24,839
I think, second law.

1279
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,159
Alright, thank
you, everyone.
