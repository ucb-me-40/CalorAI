1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
So I'm going to get
started. So today we're

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,560
talking about
pure substances.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,760
Before I get into that, at

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,520
some point in
the near future,

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,800
please go on to
prairiet.prairietest.com,

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,440
and please log in.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,360
They told me to
tell you that.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,800
So yeah, that way,

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,960
basically, you're
registered and exist.

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,479
You exist, but then

11
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,399
you will exist,
alright? Thank you.

12
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,590
Um, So Goa, today,

13
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,229
we're going to talk about

14
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:25,589
the concept of
pure substance.

15
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:26,870
We already kind
of gave you

16
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,310
a brief explanation
before.

17
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,349
We're going to do
some illustrations on

18
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:31,669
some diagrams that we're

19
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,429
going to use a lot
during the semester.

20
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:34,629
And then we're
going to come

21
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:35,629
up with some
procedures for

22
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,869
how we determine
thermite properties.

23
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:39,469
I'm going to teach
the hand tool, right?

24
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:40,469
And then I'm going to show

25
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,669
you the power tool, okay?

26
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:43,509
And hopefully at
the end of this,

27
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,830
while you will appreciate
the hand tool,

28
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,390
you will only use
the power tool,

29
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,109
hopefully in this class.

30
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,109
Okay, pure
substances, again,

31
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:52,114
sort of a review.

32
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:53,879
So it's a pure substance.

33
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,359
I'd like to talk
about it in terms of

34
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,679
these examples.
It's useful for me.

35
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,799
So a pure substance

36
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,319
here would be something
like nitrogen, right?

37
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,959
Pure nitrogen, air, right?

38
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,639
So, all right, air,

39
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:07,080
right, is mostly nitrogen,

40
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,719
but you also have some
oxygen in it, right?

41
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,800
But there's
nothing condensed.

42
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,640
There's no
condensed phases.

43
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,965
There everything is
basically gaseous.

44
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:15,489
Another example of a pure

45
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:16,889
substance would
be like water,

46
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:18,249
and this could
be water that's

47
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:19,970
coexisting between
its different phases.

48
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,049
So we get a vapor and

49
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,849
liquid liquid and solid,

50
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,450
you know, solid and vapor,

51
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,530
but no other components.

52
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,249
As soon as we
start to create

53
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:32,089
multi species,
multiphase things.

54
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:34,529
So if I took,
for example, you

55
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,130
know, a balloon.

56
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,529
If you took a
balloon filled

57
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:38,769
with air that I
blew it up with,

58
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,329
and I started to put that,

59
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,890
you know, into
liquid nitrogen.

60
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,489
Oxygen will condense
out of that.

61
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:44,850
So I'll end up
having a condensed,

62
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,249
let's say oxygen
phase there.

63
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:52,210
You know, and then
next to a nitrogen,

64
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,289
you know, next to

65
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,689
a nitrogen, you
know, vapor,

66
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,090
and in that case, it's
not a pure substance.

67
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,969
As I say it out loud,

68
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,130
it sounds kind
of complicated.

69
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,825
If it sounds pretty
complicated,

70
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:03,679
you know, probably
is not pure, okay?

71
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:07,320
But again, these
are some examples.

72
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,600
The most important
one that we're

73
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,800
going to deal
with right for

74
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,119
the majority of
this class is

75
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,880
pretty much
this situation,

76
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,360
either this
situation of, like,

77
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,395
air or this situation
of water, okay?

78
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:21,110
All right. So phases.

79
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,310
So we talk about phases

80
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,470
of of a pure
substance, right?

81
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,510
This can be a solid,
a liquid and a gas.

82
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,510
So the gas, we've
talked a lot

83
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,150
about, especially
ideal gases,

84
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,310
which are, you know,

85
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,149
they're like billliard
balls here, right,

86
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:37,549
liquid you know, if we
start with the gas,

87
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:39,230
the most, you
know, let's say,

88
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,349
um, you know,

89
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:42,510
random and moving one

90
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,029
here towards a
liquid, right?

91
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,909
The difference is
that you start to

92
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:49,070
have molecules that
attract each other, okay?

93
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,950
That's what
separates the liquid

94
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,390
from the gas, right?

95
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,989
So this is actually
the most complicated,

96
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,029
let's say, of the three.

97
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:55,630
And then if you

98
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,909
decrease the
temperature further,

99
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,665
you'll end up with
a solid, right?

100
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:00,780
And classical example of

101
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,020
how to visualize a solid,

102
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,140
what makes a solid
different from a

103
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,260
liquid in a gas, right?

104
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,820
The atoms are in
a lattice and

105
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,620
within that lattice,
they do not move, right?

106
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,660
They're fixed,

107
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,979
a little bit of
time out, right?

108
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,940
So, you know, here's
where you are and you

109
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,564
don't you don't move.
You know, position.

110
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:19,910
Okay. But they are allowed
to vibrate, right?

111
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,510
So the way that, you know,

112
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,269
Einstein
visualized this is

113
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,909
he saw it as like
springs, right?

114
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,870
So if I take, like, a
bunch of these atoms in

115
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,910
position and I connected
them via springs,

116
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,710
that ability to
oscillate then,

117
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,749
you know, would
allow it to

118
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:35,070
then store energy, okay?

119
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,069
So it stores it
through vibration.

120
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,300
Um, This type
of solid here

121
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,700
that I'm drawing
is called actually

122
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,340
it's called the
Einstein solid, right?

123
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,820
And the development
of this, this kind of

124
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,860
fun little cartoon here

125
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,580
was a very
important step in

126
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,660
the history of quantum
mechanics, right?

127
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,060
So one important result

128
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,500
at the time, you
know, this is like,

129
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,060
early 1900s is in,

130
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,780
you know, classical
mechanics and stuff.

131
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,700
You know, in their models,

132
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,339
they said the specific
heat was a constant.

133
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:08,139
It didn't depend
on temperature.

134
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:11,020
Awesome. Thank you. I need

135
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,180
more there's people
after me, I assume.

136
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,260
So thank you.

137
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,460
We're like the
buddy now, right?

138
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,739
Actually, they're
not Yeah,

139
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,219
they're not
energizers, though.

140
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,980
Okay. Anyways,
right, so, you know,

141
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,379
but the point is
that in reality,

142
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,099
the specific heat did

143
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,380
depend upon
temperature, right?

144
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,180
And so to explain that,

145
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,339
he came up with
this model.

146
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,819
And what's neat about it

147
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,580
is that in order
to get that,

148
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,539
essentially, you're
quantizing, right?

149
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,399
So basically, um, Also

150
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,719
around that
time, Max Plank,

151
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,279
you know, it had already

152
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,599
sort of stumbled on and

153
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:46,720
it quantized to avoid
the UV catastrophe.

154
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,799
Einstein took a bit

155
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,199
of that and then was
able with this kind of

156
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,439
nice model to predict

157
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:53,400
how specific heat
depends on temperature.

158
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,079
And then after that,

159
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,519
he did his
photoelectric effect.

160
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,999
And then, you know,
after that, those are

161
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,679
basically two pillars
of quantum mechanics.

162
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:58,879
Okay?

163
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,439
So thermodynamics, you
know, was, let's say,

164
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,279
one third one third of

165
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,559
one half of that
sort of development,

166
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:08,079
okay, which then
went much later.

167
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,320
Okay. Okay, so,
right, gases,

168
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,400
liquids, solids,

169
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,560
when we look at
phase changing,

170
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,679
this is very
important for us.

171
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,240
So think about, you
know, boiling of water.

172
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,479
We think about, you
know, right now,

173
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,799
I'm sweating a little bit.

174
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,599
It feels like a
human. I don't know.

175
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:22,840
Anyway,

176
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,599
so I'm not evapating
enough apparently.

177
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:25,799
But the point is that
right a lot of these,

178
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,520
you know, prostates
are very important.

179
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,679
The way to view
this, okay,

180
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,880
let's say we have
a state one.

181
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,999
So, you know, we
have a pressure.

182
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,680
It's like, 1
atmosphere in 20,

183
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,369
um, you know, see.

184
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,689
So let's say this
is, you know,

185
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:36,129
water there,

186
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,729
then it's going to
be as a liquid.

187
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,730
We start to heat
it up towards 100.

188
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,209
At some point around
there, you know,

189
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,490
we're going to
start to vaporize,

190
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,489
we start to heat it up.

191
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:46,569
So this is going to
go from here and

192
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:47,689
it's going to
become hot, okay?

193
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,009
It's going to
become a liquid.

194
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,849
And then at some point, as

195
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,089
we start to introduce
more heat there,

196
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,009
we start to
evaporate, okay,

197
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,009
maybe even boil some
of that liquid.

198
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,889
And, right, because
the gas there

199
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,130
is about 100 times

200
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,450
less dense than
the liquid,

201
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,489
you expect
expansion, right?

202
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,329
You know, and
then beyond that,

203
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:07,290
continue to add heat

204
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,370
in which you need
a lot of it,

205
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,769
right to boil off
all this liquid.

206
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,249
Eventually, you
end up with,

207
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:14,049
you know, a vapor,
saturated vapor.

208
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,850
And then after
that, you know,

209
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,209
we get into a
very hot vapor,

210
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,489
which we call
wet for water.

211
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,240
Louder. Steam. Yeah, it's

212
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,119
basically end up
with steam, okay?

213
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,199
But the volume, the point

214
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,519
is that the volume, right,

215
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,600
is increasing from left to

216
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,599
right in this
process. Okay, one.

217
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,360
Two, um,

218
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,199
If I take for a pure
substance, right?

219
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,839
So one post load
is if I take for

220
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,320
a pure substance two
independent properties,

221
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,599
I will be able to
then determine

222
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,080
a third dependent
property, right?

223
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
We showed this a lot
with the ideal gas.

224
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,800
Are you thinking
about ideal gas?

225
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
PV is MRT.

226
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,200
If I know P and V,
RPV is RT there.

227
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,399
Red if I know P and V,

228
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,040
then basically I
know, temperature.

229
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,640
Sort of a a simple case.

230
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,679
But it also works out for,

231
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,670
um, for water, too, right?

232
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,869
And so here
this is a three

233
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:13,469
dimensional representation
of that, okay?

234
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,149
So what does it
mean to have

235
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:18,190
with two independent
properties,

236
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,429
the ability to compute

237
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:21,429
a third dependent
property,

238
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:23,389
that means there's
a surface, right?

239
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,310
Basically, I
have a surface,

240
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,949
right, where I'd be able

241
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,270
to then, you know,
with these two,

242
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,989
let's say, independent on

243
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:31,469
that surface that exists,

244
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,430
the dependent
property, right?

245
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,530
Um, This is what Gibbs.

246
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,009
So Gibbs was
obsessed with.

247
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:38,329
If you're taking
calc three, right,

248
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,849
multidimensional calculus,

249
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,129
that was developed
for this, okay?

250
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,649
It was developed
basically for

251
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,409
this because not
only do you know,

252
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:46,650
let's say, the
pressure, I know

253
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,970
a specific volume
and temperature,

254
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,089
therefore, no pressure.

255
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,689
But if I start to
take derivatives,

256
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,289
at that point, I
get other things.

257
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,130
I will determine my
other properties there.

258
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,685
So it's very, um,

259
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:59,159
it's a very important,
um, you know, thing.

260
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,480
So again, the
point is that in

261
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
this case, you
know, the map,

262
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,280
so here, here, and let's

263
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,679
say I end up at
this case, right?

264
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,480
This type of
representation.

265
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,039
So apparently,
Maxwell, so,

266
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,999
you know, of
Maxwell's equations,

267
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:14,560
apparently like this a
lot and I guess tried

268
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,839
to make up a version

269
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,160
of this to, like,
give to Gibbs.

270
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,879
So a gift. So
Thermot and Amesis

271
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,400
apparently also
give gifts.

272
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,159
And, so Maxwell had made

273
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,960
up kind of a
three D mockup of

274
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,909
this kind of a surface
here to the right?

275
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,789
But yeah, like I said,
as soon as you can

276
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:31,669
have two of these things

277
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:32,950
for a pure substance,

278
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,870
and you find yourself
on that surface,

279
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,910
you know everything,

280
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,325
everything about
the state.

281
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:42,499
Okay, what are key
points on this?

282
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:43,860
So if we want to
orient ourselves

283
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,420
because this is kind
of complicated.

284
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,060
The one that you
should all know

285
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,499
from chemistry is
the triple line.

286
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:50,820
So what's the triple
line or triple point,

287
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,700
right? It where ice.

288
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,260
So the solid,
the liquid in

289
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,099
the vapor can coexist.

290
00:08:57,099 --> 00:08:58,900
So that's here.

291
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,700
The second important point

292
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,060
is what's called
the critical point.

293
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,299
We'll go into
this a little bit

294
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,740
more today, the
meaning of it.

295
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,899
And then for
this class, sort

296
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,060
of the three phases

297
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,659
or the three regions
that we're most

298
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,579
concerned with
are this liquid,

299
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,845
the liquid vapor and
the vapor, all right?

300
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:20,030
So I can kind of
crop that out.

301
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,190
So if I crop out
that, let's say,

302
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,150
the icy region there
or the solid region,

303
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,870
we can start to
make some of

304
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,669
the PV and PT or VT
diagrams, right?

305
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:32,910
So how do I look
at this plot?

306
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,950
So this is for water.

307
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,910
So P and V, right?

308
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,430
So this is basically a
cut in this plane in

309
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,670
the PV plane along here.

310
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,980
Um, What's in
the dark line

311
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,900
here is the liquid

312
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,060
vapor region, the
saturation line.

313
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,420
That's this kind of
parabolic upside down,

314
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,140
you know, parabolic line.

315
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,620
Here again, you're slicing

316
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,259
you're basically
slicing through that.

317
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,740
So that's the line
that you see.

318
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,620
Alright. One, two, we
have isolines, right?

319
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,069
So if I were to
make, um You know,

320
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:08,630
if I were to
basically look

321
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,270
as a projection of,

322
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,750
in this case,
instead of a slice,

323
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,550
if I did a projection
of PV and I just

324
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,030
look from this direction
towards it, right,

325
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,270
we'd see these kinds of

326
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,829
different isolines,
which are here, right?

327
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,030
The one that's denoted in

328
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,390
this case is the
triple line.

329
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,949
So this kind of
dash line that you

330
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:26,790
see here and shoots
up is the triple.

331
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,389
I also have it
over 200 Celsius,

332
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:30,230
300 Celsius all the way

333
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,435
on up until the
critical point.

334
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:33,480
What you'll see in

335
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,479
terms of the
regions, right?

336
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,760
This is vapor to vapor,

337
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,799
vapor liquid to
vapor liquid,

338
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,199
and then liquid, which
is, which is there.

339
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,800
And again, the
critical point,

340
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,000
which I'll discuss
in a second, right?

341
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,160
And as usual, if you want,

342
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,839
you can generate
all these plots

343
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,640
from that script, right?

344
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,610
Um, This is the
TV diagram.

345
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,289
So if we look then
from this perspective,

346
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,770
so the top view,
basically.

347
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,249
So if we took,
like, a top view

348
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,890
perspective of
this plot, again,

349
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,330
we'd still get
the same dome,

350
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,929
and then our isolines
are then our isobars,

351
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,970
right, lines of
constant pressure.

352
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,330
So here's the triple line

353
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,250
at a very low, you know,

354
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,010
some hundreds of pascals
there all the way on

355
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,370
up until the critical
point for water, right?

356
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,009
And again, vapor liquid,
and then liquid.

357
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:21,969
And then the final one is

358
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:23,329
then the PT diagram.

359
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,130
All right. And this
is important, okay?

360
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,790
So if I look from
this perspective.

361
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,550
So if I'm looking
from temperature on

362
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,550
the horizontal axis
pressure on the vertical,

363
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,949
this kind of vapor
liquid region that

364
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:40,390
we see here looks
like a line, okay?

365
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,950
It looks like
a line, right?

366
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,229
And so if I start
to draw the ochres,

367
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,309
so the lines of
constant volume, right,

368
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,070
when I'm in the vapor
region, you know,

369
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,110
out, you know, here, it
kind of makes sense.

370
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,789
I see them different.
But as soon

371
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:58,430
as I get to the
liquid vapor region,

372
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,749
right, they
collapse, right?

373
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,529
And why is that?
Okay? Why is that?

374
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,569
It's because when I
go from a liquid,

375
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:08,010
which is here, I have

376
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,330
very low specific volume,
right? I'm dense.

377
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,049
I have very low
specific volume.

378
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:13,770
When I go to my vapor,

379
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,289
I have very high
specific volume.

380
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:16,770
I have I have

381
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,810
low density, you
know, with that.

382
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,210
And when I look from
this perspective,

383
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,010
I just see a line.

384
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,970
So I have a huge jump in

385
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,970
specific volume
when I go from

386
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,170
my liquid to my
vapor, all right?

387
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,140
Um, Why does that matter?

388
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,900
So, who cares?

389
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,540
Why am I telling
you about that?

390
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,140
Because if I know

391
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,380
my temperature and my
pressure, all right?

392
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,460
I told you before,
pure substances with

393
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,659
two independent
properties,

394
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:43,940
I know everything, right?

395
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,180
The only caveat I'm
going to give it to

396
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,220
you is that when you're in

397
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,540
the liquid vapor region,

398
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,820
temperature and pressure

399
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,380
are not enough, okay?

400
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,860
In the liquid vapor
region, you know,

401
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,619
you need to know
specific volume

402
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:00,739
and pressure or
specific volume

403
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,260
and temperature, right?

404
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,620
And it has to do
with the fact

405
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,145
that when I
boil something,

406
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,350
it's going to boil

407
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,630
with constant
pressure, right?

408
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,350
You make brilla, you
know, at home, you know,

409
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,710
pasta at home, and it

410
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,230
gives you directions,
you boil, okay?

411
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,949
And you do it for that
it's super repeatable.

412
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:16,430
That's why it's an
instruction on there,

413
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:16,670
right?

414
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,229
The temperature is also

415
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:22,029
constant during
that process.

416
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:23,470
So that whole process

417
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,710
of basically going from,

418
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,590
let's say,

419
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,150
the full liquid at
the boiling point.

420
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,110
So a saturated liquid,

421
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,750
I'll come into what
that means in a second,

422
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,829
all the way to being
completely evaporated.

423
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,829
So a saturated vapor,

424
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:36,790
the temperature and

425
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,950
the pressure are constant.

426
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,030
But obviously,
something is changing.

427
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,310
The specific volume of

428
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,675
that mixture is
changing, okay?

429
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:46,880
So you can use
the, you know,

430
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,160
so when you're liquid,

431
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,920
when you're vapor, when

432
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
you're above the
critical point, right?

433
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,279
Any two of these pairs is

434
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,240
enough for you to map out.

435
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,199
But I want you to

436
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,320
think about this
when you say, okay,

437
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,640
when I have a saturated
liquid vapor mixture,

438
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,639
you think back to this
beautiful, you know,

439
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,999
Maxwell, you know, looking
carved solid here,

440
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,560
and you would
say, okay, look

441
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,080
at the side view
here, right?

442
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,360
I know that PNT is not
enough because there's

443
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,840
a whole bunch of states
into the page there,

444
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,200
you know, where,
you know, so

445
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,800
it's not enough
information to it, okay?

446
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,909
I feel like I
confused you all,

447
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:26,189
but it will make sense
with time. Go ahead.

448
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,269
Are there any
other regions

449
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,550
where two aren't enough?

450
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,670
So, you look at this.

451
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,070
Basically, if you look at,

452
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,270
um, you know, the
diagram here.

453
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,550
I would say that
this is the

454
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,870
only one that I
know of where

455
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,670
you have that,
you know, well,

456
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,990
it's not the only one,
right, because you

457
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,749
can also have
a solid vapor,

458
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:45,709
you know,

459
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,230
coexistence with the
same sort of thing,

460
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,430
right?

461
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,189
You basically go from

462
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:49,190
the low density of that,

463
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,310
but aside from
that, you know,

464
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,550
if you look at then

465
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,909
solid liquids depending on

466
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:56,549
the density of the
phase transition.

467
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:58,350
But for the purposes
of this class,

468
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,790
it's the coexistence
of the liquid in

469
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,790
the vapor region where

470
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,830
you have this
challenge, okay?

471
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,320
But specific volume,
you cannot go wrong.

472
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,090
Specific volume, you know,

473
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,850
you're not going
to go wrong, you

474
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,930
know, with that, okay?

475
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,730
Yes, please.
Name, by the way.

476
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,289
Sorry, I'm. David.

477
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,570
I do not have plasma
on this plot.

478
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,370
The fourth phase. Yeah.

479
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,290
Okay. Cross over
to, you know,

480
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,650
your physics
building for that.

481
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,330
Other questions?

482
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,140
Okay. Yes. So how

483
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,219
does the book denote this?

484
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,060
So what did I tell you?

485
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,859
I told you about
vapor, liquid vapor,

486
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,340
liquid, and I mentioned
a critical point.

487
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,020
And so that's
the terminology

488
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,540
that I like, okay?

489
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,980
The book has other names.

490
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,260
So this region, so I

491
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,780
show you the TV
diagram, right?

492
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,900
So very high density or

493
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,420
low specific volume
high density.

494
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,419
So you have a liquid.

495
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,420
The book a lot of times
calls this, like,

496
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,840
a compressed liquid
region, okay?

497
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,060
All right? I don't know.

498
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,740
Anyways, it's a
liquid, right?

499
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,619
It's very hard to

500
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:14,020
compress actually
a liquid, right?

501
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,780
It's like
compressing a solid.

502
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,020
You can't really
make the atoms much,

503
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,380
you know, a lot
of times it's

504
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,020
incompressible, as
we call it, right?

505
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,130
So you have compressed
liquid, All right.

506
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,170
So the next one is
that, again, this dome.

507
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,129
So we call this a dome.

508
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,290
To the left of the
critical point,

509
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,490
we call this as a
saturated liquid line.

510
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,170
What does it mean?

511
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,610
If you're anywhere
on this line,

512
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,450
it means that you are
a pure liquid, okay?

513
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,250
At the critical point
to the right here,

514
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,930
we have what's called

515
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,290
the saturated vapor line.

516
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,809
The way to
visualize this is

517
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,450
you've just boiled off

518
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,970
that absolute last amount

519
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,810
of liquid into
a vapor, okay?

520
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,650
Saturated vapor, alright?

521
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,320
Um, region in between

522
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,000
it and it is a saturated
liquid vapor region.

523
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The way to visualize
this is almost like

524
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,239
percent evaporated
of the substance.

525
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:04,480
So zero as I have
0% evaporated,

526
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,919
so I'm a saturated liquid.

527
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,839
To here, I have
100% evaporated,

528
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,240
so I'm the the pure vapor.

529
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,559
And then to the
right of this is

530
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,400
what's called the
superheated vapor region,

531
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,310
which for water is Steam.

532
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,509
Steam. It's basically
steam steam here, okay?

533
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,269
And a lot of times on the

534
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:27,670
plots, too, so
additionally,

535
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,149
you see lines, and
these lines are

536
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,469
normally denoted
some constant value.

537
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:32,630
So if I'm plotting

538
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,070
temperature in
specific volume,

539
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,389
this is going to
be an isobar.

540
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,030
So lines of
constant pressure.

541
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,510
You see in the phase
change region,

542
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,590
so the saturated
liquid vapor region,

543
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,990
that the temperature
is constant.

544
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,389
So the pressure
is constant and

545
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,949
the temperature is
constant, okay?

546
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:46,389
Just like we had
said before.

547
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:48,470
And then the same thing
with the PV diagram.

548
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,790
So we have the isobars

549
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,789
are which are
temperature, okay?

550
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:55,269
Okay, so what is
this critical point,

551
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,509
alright? Is there
a question?

552
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,270
This is like the globe.

553
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,550
I don't care what
you call it,

554
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,589
as long as you can get
yourself there, okay?

555
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:08,749
We get different names for

556
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:09,589
different countries and

557
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,630
whatever and languages.

558
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,189
So as long as you
like, you know,

559
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:16,229
are at this GPS coordinates
in flatland here,

560
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,549
then well, curve

561
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:23,149
flatland's enough
for me, okay?

562
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:24,909
All right. Other
questions?

563
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:26,570
That's a fair question.

564
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,310
Okay, so what's
the meaning

565
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,270
of this critical
point, alright?

566
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,990
So we can talk about this.

567
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,070
So imagine so
let's say I'm at

568
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,550
this temperature,
you know,

569
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,150
down here, and let's
say that I'm uh um,

570
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,549
you know, and we
analyze this line.

571
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:44,490
So here, right?

572
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,009
The specific volume
is pretty low,

573
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:49,169
okay, when I'm a liquid.

574
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,530
And then when I'm a vapor,

575
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,970
the specific volume
is pretty high.

576
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,089
The difference
between them is

577
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,129
relatively large,
all right?

578
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:58,169
Now I start to move
up in temperature.

579
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:00,730
The liquid specific
volume it's higher,

580
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,170
and the vapor specific
volume is lower.

581
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,769
And this continues on

582
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,569
and on until
you reach up to

583
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,129
this point where
the difference

584
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:10,010
in the specific volume,

585
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:10,569
the difference in

586
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,330
the density
between the liquid

587
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,490
and the vapor cannot

588
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,049
be detected anymore, okay?

589
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,810
You cannot differentiate

590
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,129
between them, all right?

591
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,969
Does anyone know what
we call that fluid?

592
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,059
Say it again?
I can't hear.

593
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:27,699
Sorry. Liquid vapor?

594
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,859
No, not liquid vapor.

595
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:31,820
What do we call
that substance?

596
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,739
Okay,

597
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,859
it's called a supercritical
fluid, all right?

598
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,220
And you can ask
yourself, who cares

599
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,700
about a
supercritical fluid?

600
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,409
Um You're too young
to care about this,

601
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:44,770
but maybe when
you're older,

602
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,610
you want to drink
decaffeinated coffee

603
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,209
because I don't
know, you're wild.

604
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:48,849
The way that you

605
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,329
decaffeinate
coffee is you use

606
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:52,010
carbon dioxide and you put

607
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,810
it to a high temperature
and a high pressure.

608
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,010
You make it super
critical, right?

609
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,770
It turns out it's

610
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,450
great solvent for
things like that.

611
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,849
For power plants, when

612
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:00,969
you want to get to,
like, to be very,

613
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:02,210
very efficient,
which means

614
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,290
to run at very
high temperatures.

615
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,530
You know, they're for
water. You can heat

616
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,489
water also above this
critical point, right?

617
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,169
To get to basically at
higher temperature and

618
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,330
pressures to more
efficiently,

619
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,169
you know, generate
it, okay?

620
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:17,130
This is not you know,

621
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,490
like a fourth
phase of matter.

622
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,649
It's still a fluid, but

623
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:21,249
it's a fluid
where you cannot

624
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:23,690
differentiate
between a liquid

625
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,249
and a vapor, right?

626
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:28,330
They can't be
distinguished.

627
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,560
Um, The type of
phase transition.

628
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,879
So if I start off,

629
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,320
we'll start off
with the first one.

630
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,559
So if I started
with this type of

631
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,959
transition where
I go from, like,

632
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,279
a liquid to a vapor,

633
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:38,839
we call that as

634
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,199
a first order
transition, right?

635
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,040
It's a big change
in the density

636
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,440
from being one to
the other, right?

637
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,039
It's called first
order. 1 second.

638
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,719
When we talk about
this one going from

639
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,560
a critical point,
and then I'm down.

640
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,240
So if I started at
a high temperature,

641
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,440
let's say constant
specific volume,

642
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,119
and I start to
decrease there,

643
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,919
that's a second order
transition, okay?

644
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:58,199
And if you want to
read more about that,

645
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:01,119
there's beautiful
theories of Lev Landau.

646
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,520
He was a phenomenal
Soviet physicist

647
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,719
who did a number
of things,

648
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,760
but also looked
at these sort

649
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,039
of what are called
second order,

650
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,840
um, you know, transitions.

651
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,439
And the way you visualize
it is that, again,

652
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:13,000
you start out with
very small differences

653
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,880
in the density or
specific volume,

654
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,599
and then basically
they linearly

655
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,600
get larger. Yes, please.

656
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,120
So is that site
more of a smart?

657
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,559
Does it have more of
the properties of

658
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,000
a fluid or more of a gas?

659
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,199
It's a fluid, okay?

660
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:29,119
And a gas and a
liquid are a fluid.

661
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,759
Okay? So I said liquid,
and I said gas.

662
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,199
A liquid and a gas
are both fluids.

663
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,199
Okay. Other questions.

664
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,280
Read about Lando.
Very interesting.

665
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,719
Actually died very
young. It was tragic.

666
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,159
He won a Nobel
Prize, though.

667
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,269
Okay. Um, Okay, yeah,

668
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,110
so we talked about

669
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,509
basically this critical
point where, again,

670
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:53,670
you can't
differentiate between

671
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,270
the liquid and the vapor.

672
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,750
So the PV diagram.

673
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,470
We'll use this one
a lot, especially

674
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,909
later on with some cycles.

675
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,349
PT diagram, not really
used very much.

676
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:05,669
The only reason I show it

677
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:08,309
here is because, right?

678
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,469
Most substances would
look like this,

679
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:14,069
but water is a
tremendously weird, very,

680
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:17,670
very weird substance,
where the ice is less,

681
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,229
you know, its solid
phase is less

682
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:21,069
dense than it's
it's liquid, okay?

683
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:22,229
So basically, that's
the one where

684
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:23,470
it bends backwards,

685
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,989
and we'll use this a
little bit later in,

686
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:27,570
like, we, um, 13.

687
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,929
We want to
estimate, you know,

688
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,089
how much energy it takes
to evaporate. Okay.

689
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,249
Alright, that's all done.

690
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:35,409
We'll come for
a second now.

691
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:36,850
So again, so again, pure

692
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,290
substances, two
independent properties.

693
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,370
You know, we can compute

694
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,649
the dependence and
everything after that.

695
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:45,290
Um, The hand tool.

696
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,650
So the old
fashioned way to do

697
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,170
this is the
property table.

698
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,449
So here you have 34 of

699
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:51,210
them at the back
of your book.

700
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,969
If you were to
pick one of these,

701
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:54,249
let's say table A four,

702
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,570
so saturated water and
temperature table.

703
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,089
What you'll see here is

704
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:01,289
right temperature with it,

705
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:04,049
the pressure
associated with that,

706
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,609
and then things like

707
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:07,729
saturated liquid,
saturated vapor,

708
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:09,650
because remember, the
density will vary

709
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,809
continuously from being

710
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:12,490
the liquid to the vapor,

711
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,090
saturated liquid
internal energy,

712
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,449
and so on and so forth
with that, okay?

713
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:19,370
So again, you have

714
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,769
your temperature
as one of them.

715
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,170
The corresponding
saturation

716
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,715
temperature or pressure

717
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:25,419
your specific volume of

718
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:26,539
your liquid and your

719
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,220
specific volume
of your vapor,

720
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,459
okay? Why is it F?

721
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,740
It's not F because
it's fluid.

722
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,139
It's F because
it's fluykit,

723
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:38,100
okay, which is German
for liquid, all right?

724
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,059
The Germans did all
this, all right?

725
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,019
So not my fault, okay?

726
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,779
So the F there, again,

727
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:46,099
if you want to go and
do an old school,

728
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,059
you know, and use

729
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,340
a saw by hand,
I respect that.

730
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,259
It's going to
take a long time,

731
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,189
but that's the F, okay?

732
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:56,639
The saturated
vapor is G, okay?

733
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:58,119
And the G is then

734
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:00,000
all the properties
of saturated vapor,

735
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,439
and gas east gas.

736
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:05,880
Gas is gas, okay, in
both of them, right?

737
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,320
So you'll see
things like VG,

738
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,199
right, which is then

739
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,375
the specific volume
of the vapor.

740
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:15,069
F, specific volumes
of the liquid,

741
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:15,669
and sometimes

742
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:17,189
you'll see the
difference reported.

743
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,749
Sometimes you'll see FG,

744
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,069
and that's nothing but

745
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:21,630
specific volume of the gas

746
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,190
minus the specific volume

747
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,309
of the liquid, alright.

748
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,230
You'll also see
there then sort

749
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,430
of this HFG. We'll
get to what H means.

750
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,029
It means enthalpy.
But this HFG,

751
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:33,509
the way to think
about this is

752
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:35,825
kind of the difference
at constant pressure.

753
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:38,979
The difference in or

754
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,379
the amount of energy
you need to put in,

755
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,099
the amount of heat you
need to transfer in

756
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,099
or the energy to
transfer in to

757
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:50,579
boil a kilogram of
liquid water, okay?

758
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,180
So for these conditions,

759
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:58,259
it's like 2,200 joules
per gram for water,

760
00:24:58,259 --> 00:24:59,899
which I can tell you
is a lot of energy.

761
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,059
It takes a lot
of energy to

762
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:03,949
boil boil water, okay?

763
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:06,240
Yeah. And so, again,
if you go in,

764
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,439
like,

765
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,480
a typical problem that

766
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,279
we're going to work on,

767
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,520
you'll be given
things like,

768
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,800
let's say, temperature
and quality.

769
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,039
Alright? So you're
going to tell me,

770
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,679
Professor Schutz,
you told me,

771
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,080
like, temperature
and pressure.

772
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,919
You know, these are pretty

773
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,599
much my independent
properties.

774
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,719
Sure. But there's
other ones that

775
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,640
also exist there that

776
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,359
we're going to get into.

777
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,000
One of them is
called quality,

778
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,360
alright? And
there's quality.

779
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,879
Alright? So when I
say the term like

780
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:31,159
saturated vapor and
saturated liquid,

781
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,094
the quality is
like how much

782
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:34,669
Have I gone from being a

783
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:35,949
liquid to a vapor, right?

784
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:37,549
So if I have a
quality of zero,

785
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:39,429
I am a saturated liquid.

786
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:40,709
If I have a
quality of one,

787
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,709
it means that I have
a saturated vapor.

788
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:46,149
I have no liquid left,
mathematically, right?

789
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:48,550
It's inside of, let's
say, a container.

790
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,390
The mass that's the vapor

791
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,589
divided by the
total mass, okay?

792
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:53,990
And it's only relevant,

793
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,549
right when you're
in the saturated

794
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:59,554
liquid vapor region, okay?

795
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:03,560
Cool. So again, we love
graphs here in plots.

796
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,559
So here's again,
TV, all right?

797
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,479
I want to know this
property at B, all right?

798
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:10,839
And for this type of

799
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,160
problem that I've
given you here,

800
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,920
essentially what I've
said is that this is

801
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,680
a temperature of 85
degrees Celsius.

802
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,120
And let's say
at the moment

803
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,400
that this is an equality

804
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,880
roughly sort of
equality of some value.

805
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,480
This looks to me
like less than 0.5,

806
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,359
but let's say
that's the value.

807
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,120
So you can understand
then by giving you

808
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,799
this temperature and
giving you this value,

809
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,119
you could say where
point B is, right?

810
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,599
It's halfway between
A and C there, okay?

811
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,879
Again, like, look
through this and,

812
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,399
you know, and
understand it.

813
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:45,559
Again, C would be
like X is one,

814
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,559
A would be X is zero

815
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:50,080
at this
temperature, right?

816
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,039
So yeah, you can go
through and compute it.

817
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,919
So if you looked
up then, you know,

818
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:55,559
you could look up in

819
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,119
the tables then
at point C,

820
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,279
what would be
the saturated,

821
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,530
um, specific volume of
the saturated vapor.

822
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,449
At 85 C, you could
look up what

823
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,649
is the saturated liquid?

824
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:10,849
Specific volume at 85
C, you would have them.

825
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,410
And this specific volume

826
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,129
in the middle
is nothing but

827
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:18,649
Vg X plus Vf one minus X.

828
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:20,009
To see if that
works out, if

829
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,930
X was one, right,
this is gone.

830
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,090
You have the specific
volume of the gas.

831
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,090
If X is zero,
this is gone,

832
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,730
and you have the
specific volume

833
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,369
of your liquid there.

834
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,800
Okay. Yeah, cool. You
can go in and do it.

835
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,199
Again, this is, you know,

836
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:42,040
my best attempt at

837
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,199
showing you essentially
what it is.

838
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,919
So you find that table.
You click on that.

839
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:46,920
You'd go and find edge 85

840
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,479
C. You then pick out

841
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,679
what your VG
and your VF is,

842
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,699
and you'd have
them there, okay?

843
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:55,639
Cool. When I
was a student,

844
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,159
we, like, programmed
all this in, like,

845
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,679
a TI 83 calculator
to, like,

846
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,879
make it fast on

847
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,719
a midterm. It was
brutal, okay?

848
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,039
Yeah,

849
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,519
so that's what it would
look like, you know,

850
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,920
VFVG you could go in,

851
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,279
substitute that value, and

852
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,840
then you would
end up with 1.4,

853
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,519
you know, kilograms per
meter cubed, right?

854
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,959
And to check
yourself, to make

855
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,639
sure that you did
this right, right?

856
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:16,160
That specific volume

857
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,279
that you determined there

858
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,639
should be
intermediate between

859
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:20,279
a vapor and a
liquid, right?

860
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,719
If it was less than

861
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,600
the liquid or greater
than the vapor,

862
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,999
you did something
wrong, right?

863
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:26,679
You know, with it.
That's the kind of

864
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,879
critical thinking that one

865
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:30,800
can do for such
a calculation,

866
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:36,049
all right? Quality, right?

867
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,890
All right, good. There's
other ones, too.

868
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,569
So you can go in and
do compressed liquid.

869
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:40,929
You can do

870
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:44,169
superheated vapor
for these things.

871
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,850
So this is what a
temperature you know,

872
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,850
enthalpy diagram,

873
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,250
temperature,
internal energy.

874
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,170
These are two
other sort of

875
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,570
independent properties

876
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,649
that we can use.

877
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,849
If you wanted to use

878
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,370
the superheated
water vapor,

879
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,759
you'd go to table A six.

880
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,389
You'd have to know
what your pressure is.

881
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:00,870
You put in your pressure.

882
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,549
You check that your
temperature is

883
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,349
greater than the
saturation temperature,

884
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:05,550
and then you could start

885
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,109
to do what's called
interpolation.

886
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,790
You start to interpolate
between values.

887
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,309
There's compressed
liquid, again,

888
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:13,470
the same drill,
no pressure.

889
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,590
And, you know, find
your temperature,

890
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,949
the closest one and either

891
00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:19,189
select it or
interpolate with it.

892
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:20,389
Your GSIs will take

893
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:21,269
you through
some of that if

894
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:24,389
you have questions, okay?

895
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:28,079
But The same thing
essentially holds.

896
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,160
As long as you
know these sort

897
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,400
of two independent
properties,

898
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,799
you'll be able to
compute everything.

899
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,719
So if you said, I have
a problem here with

900
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,320
like 200 C and 150,

901
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,359
you know, kpA, you

902
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,399
could hazard a guess
that, like, okay, this,

903
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,480
you know, the pressure in

904
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,560
this room is
probably close to

905
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,919
what 110, you know,

906
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,759
order 100 pA. You

907
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,279
can hazard a
guess that, okay,

908
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,890
maybe the pressure
is, you know,

909
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,219
50% higher, but

910
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:53,660
my temperature
is much higher.

911
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,019
200 C. You can hazard
a guess and say,

912
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,259
that's probably maybe
a superheated vapor.

913
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:00,140
And so these two
property values

914
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,699
together are going
to be able to tell

915
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:05,419
me everything about
the system, right?

916
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,859
So then what you
can do right in

917
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:09,140
Python is just put
your substance,

918
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,419
water, put T is

919
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:12,579
that temperature,
P is that value.

920
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,179
And then with
dot notation,

921
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,419
you define this
object, and

922
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,579
then you'd know
everything t dot U,

923
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,659
internal energy, t dot V,

924
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,539
specific volume
and so on and so

925
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,619
forth with that, okay?

926
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:25,739
But they're the same
thing. Actually, doing

927
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:27,700
it this way is going
to be more accurate.

928
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,179
What you'll see
when you try to do

929
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:31,059
these linear
interpretations or

930
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:33,259
when you do interpolation
between values,

931
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:34,860
you're going to see
that it's assuming

932
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,580
like linearity,

933
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,659
which may not be
the case, right?

934
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,819
The curves bend
and all of that.

935
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:44,939
So this would be exact
if you do it this way.

936
00:30:44,939 --> 00:30:47,859
Cool. So to check that,

937
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,019
let's see if you

938
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:49,939
know what you're
talking about here.

939
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:50,259
All right.

940
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,299
So in this problem,
what I want you to do,

941
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:54,500
I'll launch it,
but essentially

942
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,899
look at this plot
here, right?

943
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:58,220
So I have this diagram
of a TV diagram.

944
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,899
I say I have 50
kilograms of

945
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,140
saturated liquid
water at ADC.

946
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,099
And what are the three
answers to this?

947
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,020
Take like 5 minutes for
that and then we'll
