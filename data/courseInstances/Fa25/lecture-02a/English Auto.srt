1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,599
All right, I got 210.

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,040
So today we're talking

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,680
about energy. All right.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,000
So cycles,
internal energy,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,720
heat and energy
transfer by

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,120
heat and work and work
transfer processes.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,199
So where we left
off last time,

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,079
we're talking
about states.

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,320
If we connect states

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,960
together, we can
make a process.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,439
If we string them all

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,039
together and make it
into a loop, right,

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,240
we call that essentially,

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,679
um a cycle, all right?

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,279
And that's really what

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,480
mechanical engineers

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,919
are like chiefly
concerned with, right?

18
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,399
So taking heat
into work, working

19
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,159
to heat like that.

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,039
Yeah, if you want to
see this cycle here,

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,399
most of my lecture
slides from here on out,

22
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,119
I'll have my notes
and work that as

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,679
examples available
through the data hub.

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,960
So if you click
that link, it'll

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,319
pull up a Jupyter
notebook.

26
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,600
It has usually my notes

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,559
and then also
calculations,

28
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:54,479
and you can recreate

29
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,319
plots like that,
all right?

30
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,439
This one just happens
to be an important one,

31
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,359
especially for
aerospace engineers.

32
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,880
So this is pretty
much the basis

33
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,920
of jet propulsion,

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,639
but also how we make for

35
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:08,800
mechanical engineers,

36
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
how we make electricity

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,239
from, like, natural gas.

38
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,399
So how this comes in and

39
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:18,079
produces power
there. Okay? Good.

40
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,079
And then this also gives
an introduction to

41
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,160
some of how we compute
the properties.

42
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,599
So you may or
may not know,

43
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,349
but the old school way of

44
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,909
taking things like
temperature and

45
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,710
pressure and computing
internal energy,

46
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,589
and the other properties
involve tables.

47
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:32,709
If you want to see
these, each of

48
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,430
the homework
problems has a PDF,

49
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,309
you can click on it.

50
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:37,789
I think there's no less
than like 17 of them.

51
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,349
There's the SI, there's

52
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,150
then the imperial units.

53
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,749
It's a lot, okay?

54
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:45,709
You know, when I
was taught and

55
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,310
raised my old
man's a carpenter,

56
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,469
so he taught me
to use the hand

57
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:49,709
tool before the
power tool.

58
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,589
So the hand tool,

59
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:51,909
in this case is
the paper tables.

60
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:52,789
I encourage you to have

61
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,509
a look see what
that's like,

62
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,789
and then probably
the next from there

63
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,310
at that point, that
state onwards,

64
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,350
your future processes
will involve

65
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,709
no paper and essentially
what I would call,

66
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,790
like a thermodynamic
calculator,

67
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,830
in this case, Pi Killor

68
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,029
and really grateful to
Professor Frank Locke,

69
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,550
who's taught this
course for many years,

70
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,310
who took all of his
knowledge that he had in

71
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,110
MAT lab and put this
into the Python.

72
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,430
So you're the
first ones to

73
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,260
benefit from you know,

74
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,340
him being a nice
guy in doing that.

75
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,940
So if you click through
that, you should be

76
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,860
able to see kind of
the basics of it.

77
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,900
And then this week

78
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,060
in the discussion
sections,

79
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,219
the GSI should also

80
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,220
be taking you
through how to

81
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,979
do property calculations
with electronically.

82
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,475
Alright? As Clar.

83
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:37,930
Cool. That's one thing.

84
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,330
The second thing
I want to say,

85
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,810
this has come up in
the homework problems

86
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,850
in that is it's
very important.

87
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,329
So if we do all
the homeworks

88
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,810
online and all that,
it's like, great,

89
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,129
but it's still very
important for you,

90
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,650
right, to be able to

91
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,450
explain your logic, right?

92
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,970
So how do I want to
see that, right?

93
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,609
First, whenever
you do this,

94
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,330
you're going to
take notes, right?

95
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,810
You're going to write
a problem statement.

96
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,290
The first thing you're
going to do after

97
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,690
that is to draw a
schematic, right?

98
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,049
You're gonna draw
your schematic.

99
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,730
You're going to show
me boundaries, right?

100
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,289
You know, that's
what we learned from

101
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,849
the first part,
you're going to draw.

102
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,209
Tell me what
you're assuming

103
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,610
ideal gas behavior,
so on and so forth.

104
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,809
Any physical laws.

105
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,290
So conservation of energy,

106
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,595
the first law of thermo.

107
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,020
Calculate your
properties, right?

108
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,700
So that might be Pi here,

109
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,860
you know, calculations
and reasoning, okay?

110
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,820
And when I grade something
and I still grade,

111
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,059
like a bunch of
your problems

112
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,940
on your quizzes
and your finals,

113
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,419
because I want to
see if you really

114
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,660
know, you might get like,

115
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,660
if a problem is 15 points,

116
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,540
I might give you

117
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,100
one point for a
right answer.

118
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,500
And the other 14 are
how you think, okay?

119
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,940
It works the
other way too.

120
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,140
You might give me
a wrong answer,

121
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,260
but if you look
like you can string

122
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,540
processes together and

123
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,859
you have the
right thinking,

124
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,340
I grade that, okay?

125
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,789
So if you ask yourself,

126
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:51,070
why in my homework, am I

127
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,510
writing out my
work on the PDF?

128
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,390
Because the whole point of

129
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,469
the homework is to get you

130
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:55,309
in game shape for

131
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:56,629
an assessment
and for a quiz.

132
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:57,910
So it's practice, right?

133
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,910
And how you do that on

134
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,830
the homework is going to

135
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,950
be a one to one for
how quizzes do, right?

136
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,669
We're going to run this

137
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:03,750
through Pie Learn, right?

138
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,030
You're going to show
your work on paper

139
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,430
that's going to be in
front of you, right?

140
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,910
It's going to be like
that, all right?

141
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,990
Cool. Also, our
accreditation depends on it.

142
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,490
Okay, um which just

143
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,249
got extended for six
years, I was told today.

144
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:17,089
It was wonderful.

145
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,770
Okay, so that's a
bit about that.

146
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,809
Now, back into
the whole part

147
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,609
about internal energy.

148
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:23,810
Remember before we talked

149
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,769
about energy can come
in many forms, right?

150
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,129
Actually, it's
one of the things

151
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,609
that we still don't know.

152
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,969
There's a great,
like, quote from

153
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,330
Richard Feynman
about that,

154
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,609
but it's like
a weird thing

155
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,170
where it doesn't really

156
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,289
come in, like, packets.

157
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:38,729
We only know it from
formula, right?

158
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:39,569
The most common one is,

159
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,689
like, kinetic
energy, right?

160
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,730
One half mv squared,

161
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,809
you know, like
it's a math thing,

162
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:46,929
and then out of that
you get energy.

163
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:48,009
It's of you
know, it's like

164
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,249
you go and you
weigh it, right?

165
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,129
Um, and you're
going to have that.

166
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,449
You have chemical energy.

167
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:53,650
So we talked
about inertial,

168
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,969
you have kinetic energy,

169
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,689
you know, nuclear, right?

170
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,169
It's kind of like
all over the place.

171
00:04:58,169 --> 00:04:59,970
So it's a very seemingly

172
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,249
simple but actually very
complicated subject.

173
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:03,529
So we say in thermo,

174
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:04,929
all we really want
to care about

175
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,929
is really this
internal energy.

176
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:09,569
And that internal
energy for

177
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:10,809
a simple system really

178
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:11,930
only depends on
something like,

179
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,490
let's say, temperature
and pressure,

180
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,484
right, two sort of
properties there.

181
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,800
And I didn't say too

182
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,040
much about the mechanisms.

183
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,199
The closer we got to
the mechanisms of what

184
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,359
internal energy is was
these ideal gases.

185
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,159
So remember the
ping pong balls or

186
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,439
the billards right?
The balls bouncing.

187
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,680
What type of energy
did that possess?

188
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,039
What type of energy does
an ideal gas store?

189
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,889
Say it again?

190
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,850
Translational, right?
So translational.

191
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,490
But some molecules
that are polyatomic,

192
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,810
meaning they have two.

193
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,170
Not only do
they translate,

194
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,529
but they spin, right?

195
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,889
So they can have
rotational.

196
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,210
Some of them can
have vibrational

197
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,209
energy associated
with them,

198
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,770
and things like electrons

199
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,489
can also possess
spin energy, right?

200
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:01,970
So you start with
the ideal gas,

201
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,730
and the more
sophisticated you get,

202
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,529
you can have different
mechanisms of storage,

203
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:08,769
right?

204
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,810
But at the end
of the day, Um,

205
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,689
you know, so it's
a molecule moving.

206
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,010
It's, you know, it's

207
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,770
vibrating, right?
It's rotating.

208
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,490
But all of these
can contribute as

209
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,889
mechanisms to the
internal energy, okay.

210
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,029
Okay.

211
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,789
One thing, all right?

212
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:27,829
And again, that's
talking about the state.

213
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,270
Now, you can
ask yourselves,

214
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,869
so that stores energy,

215
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:32,389
you know, via
those mechanisms.

216
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:33,749
How does it transfer them?

217
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,189
So how is energy exchange?

218
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:37,389
So, something that's
like hot, all right?

219
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:39,549
Where does that energy
that I see, you know,

220
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:40,829
in terms of them
moving, how does

221
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,509
it, you know, transport?

222
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,070
It's a fair question.

223
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,150
When we get to the second
law in this class,

224
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,510
what you're going
to recognize

225
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,029
is that things
that are hot,

226
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,030
you know, things that

227
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,590
possess sort of a lot of

228
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,189
thermal energy are
going to move from

229
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,189
the regions of high
to low, all right?

230
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,469
You take like a balloon,

231
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:59,949
you got like high
pressure in it,

232
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,229
the high
concentration moves

233
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:02,589
from high to
low, all right?

234
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,350
Um, and then it'll

235
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,789
be the same thing sort
of in the simulator.

236
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,109
So if you go through
and you create like

237
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:08,749
one partition that's,
like, cold, right?

238
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,230
So let's say
they're moving

239
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,589
if kinetic energy is,

240
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:13,349
you know, one
half mv squared,

241
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,509
so they have low mass or

242
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,590
really low velocity,

243
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,749
and then the other
one is, you know,

244
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,750
maybe higher mass or
really high velocity,

245
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,030
you can go in and
look at how it moves.

246
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,310
So, you know, does
the hot region cool?

247
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,749
Does the colder one
actually increase in

248
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,029
temperature until they're

249
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:29,669
essentially at the same
temperature, right?

250
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:30,749
And at that
point, you're at

251
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:31,869
equilibrium, right?

252
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,229
The only equilibrium you

253
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,509
really learned
until now is what?

254
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,769
C 85 who's taking C 85.

255
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:43,049
So what is
equilibrium in C 85?

256
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,849
You know, sum of F is
equal to zero, right?

257
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:50,290
So in thermo,
right, the uh,

258
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,239
um, you know, we have

259
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,200
thermal, basically
thermal equilibrium.

260
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
Everything at the
end of it is at

261
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,520
the same temperature.

262
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
It means that there's

263
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,799
no longer heat being
transferred there.

264
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,679
You can go on and look
at questions like

265
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,839
what does this
basically depend on?

266
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,799
But for a translational
gas, like I said,

267
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,959
this will depend on the

268
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,160
mass of your molecule,

269
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,559
the more that you
have, the more energy,

270
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,079
the square of
the velocity.

271
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,280
So it's very sensitive

272
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,879
to that. The total energy.

273
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,799
So the total internal
energy here is also

274
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:22,639
going to depend
on the number

275
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
of particles
that you have,

276
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,039
and the direction
of heat though.

277
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,279
So what does
that depend on?

278
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
Yes.

279
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,880
And anything else?
You can speak louder.

280
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,439
Name and Zach?

281
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,319
Okay. So we say it depends

282
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:46,720
on temperature and the

283
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,160
fact that they're
in contact,

284
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
okay? Yeah. Okay.

285
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,240
Does it depend on
anything else?

286
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,420
So the direction.
So I would say

287
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,060
the internal energy
definitely depends

288
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,859
on the mass of it,
but the direction.

289
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:09,099
So the direction
of heat transfer.

290
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,260
Would you say that the

291
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,420
direction of heat transfer

292
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,260
depends on the mass?
Make an argument for me.

293
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,600
One has more energy
than the other. Yeah.

294
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,320
So it's an
interesting concept.

295
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,600
It turns out no.

296
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,040
I can have something
that's like,

297
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,360
think about an ice cube.

298
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,560
If I take a
very, very tiny

299
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,360
ice cube and I
put it on Earth,

300
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,680
very large earth here.

301
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,560
You know, if we're

302
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,200
not with the polar
bears, well,

303
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,159
let's say we're in
sunny California,

304
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,640
heat then from California
is going to be

305
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,240
transferred into the
ice and melt it.

306
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,119
If I reverse it
and I say now

307
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,879
that maybe I have a
really hot cup of water,

308
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,200
then there and the
surroundings are like,

309
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,199
you know, colder
than essentially,

310
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,440
right, the heat will flow.

311
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,520
So all that's needed.

312
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,640
The take home message here

313
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,960
is it's just a temperature
difference, okay?

314
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,799
When you take MU
one oh six or 109,

315
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,120
you'll see there that
essentially it's

316
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,599
only the temperatures

317
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,880
the gradient that's
involved, okay?

318
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,400
So your point where
you mentioned

319
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,639
the fact that
the containers

320
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,800
have to be in contact.

321
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,600
That's a fair point.

322
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,760
Here, I obviously
removed that.

323
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,679
If you read your textbook,

324
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,080
sometimes they leave.

325
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,000
All right, these two
things in contact,

326
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,439
but they don't let
the mass transfer.

327
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,800
So this is basically like

328
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:37,990
a thermally conducting
wall, right?

329
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,550
So you have a thermally
conducting wall.

330
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,070
The term for
this is called

331
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,630
diathermal, right?

332
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,870
So you'll see in some of

333
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,830
your homework problems,

334
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,750
sometimes they say, like,

335
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,310
and two partitions are in

336
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,830
contact via a
diathermal wall.

337
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,909
That's what that means.

338
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,270
Basically, you can
transfer heat through it,

339
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,469
but you cannot transfer

340
00:10:57,469 --> 00:10:58,550
mass through it, okay?

341
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,830
Other questions?
Okay. And there

342
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,910
is a homework problem that

343
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,629
addresses Miles'
point about the size.

344
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,550
So it's a good question.

345
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,470
Okay, good.

346
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:16,690
Um, All right.

347
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,770
So again, until now,

348
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,609
we're considering systems
like the one that I

349
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:24,810
just mentioned where all

350
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,170
that we're exchanging is

351
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,010
we have systems that are

352
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,890
basically closed,
all right?

353
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,049
So what does closed mean?

354
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,890
So closed in this class

355
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,290
means that I don't

356
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,730
bring mass in
or out, right?

357
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,250
So if I draw a box, right?

358
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,970
So let's say this
is, you know,

359
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,609
I have a piston
cylinder here,

360
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:46,770
I have this um,
you know, box.

361
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,730
I could go in and
draw my boundary.

362
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,810
So I could go in and
draw and say, Okay,

363
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,530
this is the boundary

364
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,140
of the system that I
would like to analyze.

365
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,990
All right.

366
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,310
So this is a side view,

367
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,069
a cross sectional
view of a cylinder,

368
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:04,270
and then a piston
head, right?

369
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,230
So it's just like your
bike pump from before,

370
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,709
so it can
compress it, gas.

371
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,590
The gas can expand and

372
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,590
transfer workout, okay?

373
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,630
If I look at that
system, so I

374
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,390
don't bring mass
in and out of it.

375
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,530
The only way, You know,
that in this class,

376
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,290
we're going to look
at energy exchange

377
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,489
is through or the
only way to exchange

378
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:27,650
energy with a
closed system is

379
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,370
through heat
and work, okay?

380
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,330
All right? And
a common way

381
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,090
we're going to look at
the work part of it,

382
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,729
especially with
cylinders is

383
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:39,970
expansion and
contraction processes,

384
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,330
all right?

385
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,929
Yeah. And if you

386
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:46,810
want to know it's

387
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,050
a fair thing to
ask yourself,

388
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,770
like, you know,
sometimes you

389
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,210
might see a system
where, you know,

390
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,850
we're doing work
and we bring in,

391
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,750
um, you know,

392
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,629
like a resistor, you know,

393
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,590
into this thing,
and we apply,

394
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,430
like, a potential, right?

395
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,230
We hook that up to,
like, a battery or

396
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,389
something, and, you know,

397
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:06,470
we apply a potential,
and I would ask you,

398
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,630
you know, is that heat
or is it work, right?

399
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,510
So if I turn that on and

400
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,389
I start to transfer

401
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,629
energy into this
control volume,

402
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:13,829
I'm not transfering mass,

403
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:14,949
I'm transferring energy.

404
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:15,510
You could ask yourself,

405
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,630
is that a work transfer

406
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,670
or heat transfer
process, Right?

407
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,550
And the way to
know if it's

408
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,950
a work or a heat transfer

409
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,430
process is to
actually just ask,

410
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,349
is it a heat
transfer process?

411
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:30,150
All right? And what did

412
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,030
we already say
that you need to

413
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,990
have in order for it to

414
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,029
be a heat
transfer process?

415
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,429
Say someone not named
Miles or your name?

416
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,430
Zach. Not Miles
and not Zach.

417
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,630
So what did we say
that we needed for

418
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,520
a heat transfer?
That's it.

419
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,919
If there's a
temperature difference,

420
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,119
it's heat transfer.

421
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,759
If there's no
temperature difference,

422
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,080
it is not heat transfer.

423
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,200
This is a closed system.

424
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,079
So the only other way

425
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,960
to transfer energy
is via what?

426
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,759
Work. Work.

427
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,920
Is this a heat transfer

428
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,559
or a work
transfer process?

429
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,199
Work. Oh, my gosh.
Crushing it.

430
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,120
This is so great.
I could go home.

431
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,120
That's it. That's the
name of the game.

432
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,999
Heat and work.

433
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:14,920
You need a Delta T

434
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
in order for
it to be heat,

435
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,559
and if it's not heat,
then it's work.

436
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,600
In a closed
system. All right.

437
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,465
Okay. So Thank you.

438
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,210
Yeah. All right.
And what's

439
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,689
going to come up
a lot when we

440
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,170
look into engines and

441
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,889
stuff later is we're
going to start to,

442
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,650
like, idealize some of
these processes, okay?

443
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,690
So again, we
talked about heat

444
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,969
as a way to
transfer energy,

445
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,970
and we talked about,
you know, work.

446
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,889
And, right, if
we think to our,

447
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,570
like, first law,
so our first law,

448
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,330
was the change in
internal energy

449
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,610
of our system, right?

450
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,370
The difference
there, right is

451
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,210
the difference in the heat

452
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,249
transferred in minus

453
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,050
the work transferred
out, okay?

454
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,850
And there's like
two cases, right?

455
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,250
So what is if I showed
you this formula,

456
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,090
um, You know, well,

457
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,290
I guess I have
it on the board,

458
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,570
so I'll just say
it, all right?

459
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,690
But one case is
that we have

460
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,570
no heat transferred with

461
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,250
the control volume, okay?

462
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,890
We call that adiabatic,
adiabatic, ar?

463
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,129
All right. So that's
an adiabatic process.

464
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,930
One, all right? Okay.

465
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,170
You may recall
that we wrote

466
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,570
these little deltas there

467
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,490
because work transfer and

468
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,850
heat transfer are what

469
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,290
are called path
functions, right?

470
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,930
We need to know, we
need to think about

471
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,849
all the details,
how the pressure,

472
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:45,010
how the volume varies

473
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,570
throughout the
whole thing to

474
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,050
be able to write
that there, okay?

475
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,770
Internal energy, though,

476
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,290
on the other hand,
is a property, okay?

477
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,489
Properties don't give

478
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,090
a shit, right, about path.

479
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,610
They're just a
point. I use

480
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,890
colorful language when I

481
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,330
want to drive home
a point, right?

482
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,489
So That was a
dad joke too,

483
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:04,930
because it was a point.
All right, fine.

484
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,450
So you have here
the DU with it,

485
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,690
right? So this
difference, right?

486
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,530
This only depends on

487
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,810
the start and
the end, okay?

488
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,290
Now I'm saying I have
no heat transfer there.

489
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,330
I have, you know,

490
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,010
this path function
that's there.

491
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,650
Once I get rid
of this one,

492
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,370
right, what do you think

493
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,970
happens to this
little delta here?

494
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,410
And what does it become?

495
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,729
So I have on the
one side something

496
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:32,410
that only depends on

497
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,410
the start and
the end, right?

498
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,450
I got rid of the other one

499
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,649
that was a path dependent.

500
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,299
So this becomes Yeah, DW.

501
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,140
Okay. All right. We'll
go into a second.

502
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,019
We'll have some derivations
and look into it.

503
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,180
But basically,
you have this

504
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,820
as, you know, thing
that happens.

505
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,500
You can also go

506
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,060
the other way where you
have something with

507
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,900
no work transfer,
all right?

508
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,620
And let's say
only, you know,

509
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,580
heat transfer
associated with it.

510
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,259
There's not like
one term for it,

511
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:03,540
but a very common one

512
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,619
is a process of
constant volume.

513
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,380
So you might have
constant volume heating.

514
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,700
That's how all
your engines run.

515
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,819
Auto cycle runs on

516
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,059
a constant volume
heating of the cylinder.

517
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,599
Um, and in that case,

518
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,679
there is no work,

519
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,000
and there's only
heat transfer.

520
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,199
So you have basically the

521
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,239
opposite situation
there, okay?

522
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:24,840
Okay, final thing
about notation.

523
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,199
So when we write
something like this,

524
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,280
when we talk about a
heat heat transfer.

525
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,240
So I don't say,
like, heat,

526
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,520
I say heat I try to

527
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,079
not say heat. Heat
is not a thing.

528
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,520
So heat transfer, um,

529
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,189
I He transfer there.
I'm going to talk.

530
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:43,989
I'm going to write this

531
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:45,269
as first quarter one, two,

532
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,949
I've actually
like state one,

533
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,349
and I'm going
to state two.

534
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:49,909
So a difference
between state one

535
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:51,749
and state two, right,

536
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:53,749
that process is going
to be a first quarter,

537
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:56,709
two or let's say a
W one, two, right?

538
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,309
There is no W one,
there is no W two.

539
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:05,510
Yes, please. The
equation the negative.

540
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,189
Oh, that's a good
catch. Thank you.

541
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:10,669
I mean I didn't make yes.

542
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,229
Okay. Other questions?

543
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,200
In here example
of a resistor,

544
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,239
wouldn't the
resistor like he

545
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,399
transfers heat transfer to

546
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,050
the But through
the boundary,

547
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,569
let me think about
the boundary, right?

548
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:35,089
So if that basically is
inside of there, no.

549
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,449
Yeah. So if I have
something like outside

550
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,610
my boundary that's hot

551
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,889
and then the
inside is colder,

552
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,010
then through that I'll
have heat exchange.

553
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,649
Yes. But I could imagine

554
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:46,969
a scenario where
you might draw

555
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:48,449
a boundary
differently, right?

556
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:49,809
And there, maybe that's

557
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,730
resistors outside
of your boundary,

558
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,890
maybe out here making
things really hot,

559
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,769
then you would have

560
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,129
heat being
exchanged there.

561
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:57,809
Okay? And another one

562
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,210
we'll get into
is like paddles.

563
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,049
We have that in an example

564
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,250
today where we
basically spin

565
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,610
a paddle and mover.

566
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,809
Okay. Other
questions? Okay.

567
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:09,609
So first quarter
two. The final one

568
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,009
for this slide is

569
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:13,649
that a lot of

570
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:16,809
times so for these
problems here,

571
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,129
we're probably
just going to be

572
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:19,849
talking about Q and,

573
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:22,569
first quarter two,
one, two, like that.

574
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,769
But later on, when
we get to things,

575
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,209
like I said, the
Braden cycle,

576
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,569
the jet engines there,

577
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,569
we tend to deal
with rates, okay?

578
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,730
So we're going
to talk about

579
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,249
the rate of heat
transfer, all right?

580
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:35,439
Um, and we're not going

581
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,559
to follow the beautiful
Leibniz notation.

582
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,760
We're going to
revert to, you know,

583
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,959
Newton, and we're just

584
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,199
going to put a dot, okay?

585
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,559
And the meaning of the dot

586
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,519
then is that, right,

587
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,719
it's joules per second
or watts there, right?

588
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,039
So when I write that, this

589
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,399
is essentially right the,

590
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,079
you know, dq dt,

591
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:02,489
all right? Okay.
Yeah, exactly.

592
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,130
So here, right? So we have

593
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,329
some heat in. It's the
amount of heat in.

594
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:07,609
You know, typical
problem, I

595
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,170
have things like
mass involved in it,

596
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,049
some amount of
time, right?

597
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,769
And so then,
right, if I had

598
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:14,209
that amount of Q
over that time,

599
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,490
I come up with that Q dot.

600
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,209
The final one
that you see on

601
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:20,049
here is sometimes
in the problems,

602
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,529
they're going to
write the amount of

603
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:25,050
heat transferred on
like a per mass basis.

604
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,729
So they might
say something

605
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:29,569
like Q, like little Q,

606
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:33,129
and all little Q is
is big Q divided by,

607
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:34,369
let's say, the
mass, right?

608
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:35,409
So if I have
some amount of

609
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,049
mass that's
inside of this,

610
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,689
um, control volume, right?

611
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:40,929
Then it's just
going to be the big

612
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,169
Q divided by little M,

613
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:43,609
gives you a little Q,

614
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,810
and then the
same for work.

615
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,609
Sometimes you'll
see a little W,

616
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,809
and that's just
big W divided by

617
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,169
the mass involved
there, okay?

618
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,809
This will make more
sense once you

619
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:55,689
start to get into the
homework in that.

620
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,699
All right.

621
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,259
All right.

622
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,939
Okay, so let's analyze

623
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:17,859
the work transfer, though.

624
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,100
So let's focus here for a

625
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,059
second on the compression.

626
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,259
Let's say the compression

627
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:24,499
of I should
keep this back.

628
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:25,820
Hold on.

629
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,739
All right, the compression

630
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:29,859
of our cylinder here.

631
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:30,979
So in this problem, we

632
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,640
have, this
piston cylinder.

633
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,939
It's being moved
down, right?

634
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:38,779
So amount dH, okay?

635
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:40,300
The surface area of

636
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,619
this can this
be seen? Yeah.

637
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:44,100
The surface area then of

638
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,980
this cylinder is S, right?

639
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,579
So we're going to
call that as S.

640
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:50,179
And so there's a
pressure, right?

641
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:51,700
Basically, there's
a pressure

642
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,779
inside of here P, okay?

643
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:57,299
So the force acting,

644
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,380
so the force that we
need to push down

645
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,819
on here is then going

646
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:04,259
to be equal to this
pressure, right?

647
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,099
Or let's say, you
know, um, you know,

648
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:08,099
the pressure that's
inside here times

649
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:11,859
that surface
area of the um,

650
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:18,979
of the cylinder,
okay? All right.

651
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,179
When we move, right,

652
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,899
since the surface here is

653
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:23,979
perpendicular to the

654
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,099
direction that
we're moving,

655
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,979
this area S times dh

656
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,259
represents a
volume, right?

657
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,739
So the dv here, right,

658
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:35,740
is equal to this
S times times dh.

659
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,050
And so the work All right,

660
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,410
dw here is then equal
to the P times,

661
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,130
um, uh, well, I can
write it this way.

662
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:52,729
I can write P dv,
I can say P dv,

663
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:53,969
and then if I substitute

664
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:55,929
the dv into here,
then I'll have,

665
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,849
um, P times S
times dh, right?

666
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,699
All right. We can

667
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:06,259
recall then for
this system,

668
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,059
all right,

669
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,939
this amount of work
we can represent

670
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:10,699
right as being
equal to the

671
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:12,539
integral, let's
say, from state A.

672
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,139
So if this is at

673
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:16,939
this position, maybe
this is state A,

674
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:20,179
and then state B is when
we move it down from

675
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:25,059
A to B, then of PdV.

676
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:31,979
All right? Cool.
All right.

677
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,220
Good. What I'm showing you

678
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,979
here on these plots are

679
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:39,539
a couple of different
variants, right?

680
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,300
So the challenge,
really, the challenge

681
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,819
in this kind of, uh,

682
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:46,140
um, of integral here,

683
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,979
and I guess I could
substitute this in here,

684
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:51,379
so I could go A to

685
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:56,740
B of PS d just
for completeness,

686
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,219
but I want to focus
on this for a second.

687
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:59,819
The challenge of
integrating this

688
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,339
is that pressure and

689
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,739
volume are

690
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:08,499
normally independent
properties, okay?

691
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:10,339
So what can happen
is if you think

692
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,180
about the ideal
gas equation,

693
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,859
pressure and
volume are linked.

694
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,179
And if I think
about this problem,

695
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,740
as I compress this,

696
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,139
so I decrease the volume,

697
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:20,060
what do you expect to
happen to the pressure?

698
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,549
The back of the room.
It increase, right?

699
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:26,589
And so, you know,
in order to

700
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:28,469
execute this then, you
have to be able to,

701
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,149
you know, write
pressure as

702
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:33,389
a function of volume
here, all right?

703
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,789
Say with me, okay?

704
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,189
There's different
cases for

705
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:37,990
how that might happen.

706
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,709
So if we assume,
for example,

707
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,830
that what's inside of
here is an ideal gas.

708
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,429
So PV is RT, we could
say, all right,

709
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:47,229
let's first of all,
just focus on the case

710
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:49,270
where pressure
is constant.

711
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,630
If pressure is constant,

712
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,509
I can pull it outside
of the integral,

713
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,349
and then it's just
PDV, all right?

714
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:55,789
So how does
that look like?

715
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:58,229
PDV constant
pressure process.

716
00:24:58,229 --> 00:24:59,470
On a PV diagram,

717
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,524
it's just a flat
line, okay?

718
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:07,060
Um, and the work
that's transferred is

719
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,340
essentially just
the area beneath

720
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,500
that line because
P is constant,

721
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,460
it's Delta V. So
essentially P Delta

722
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,899
V there then is
just the shaded

723
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:19,819
rectangle below that line.

724
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,259
Right? One.

725
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,979
Next case that could
be interesting is,

726
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:29,580
again, let's say it's
still an ideal gas.

727
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,660
We keep the
temperature constant.

728
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,379
So it's isothermal.

729
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:35,499
If I keep an isothermal,

730
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,379
this is then what my

731
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:39,220
process is going
to look like.

732
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,100
I could write the pv RT.

733
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,739
I could go and say Pv is

734
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:49,139
equal to RT or

735
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,700
this is the specific
gas constant.

736
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,139
This says units of joules

737
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:53,820
per kilogram per kelvin.

738
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,419
I could say P is equal
to RT divided by V.

739
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,699
I could substitute
that into there.

740
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:02,380
Temperature is constant,

741
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,020
so I can pull that
out of the integral,

742
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,740
and what you're going
to be left with is

743
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,219
essentially the
integral of DV over V,

744
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,740
right, which is
the natural log.

745
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,020
So I'm going to
have a natural

746
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,819
log times all that
constant stuff,

747
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:14,979
and you're going to
get this line, okay?

748
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:18,099
Cool. The last one
that you have here,

749
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:19,859
the green line is the case

750
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:22,300
where we don't have
any heat transfer.

751
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,179
I'm not going to go into
deriving that today.

752
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,899
We'll get more
into the future,

753
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:27,499
but it's a really
important case.

754
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:29,979
It's a really
important case, right?

755
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,819
But the take home
message of this,

756
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:33,259
so why I'm spending all

757
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,019
the time, is that, again,

758
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:37,139
this whole point
of being able to

759
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:40,189
execute this
integral is that

760
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,710
you need to know
how pressure

761
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,070
depends on volume

762
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,509
for each part of

763
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:46,070
the art of the
process, right?

764
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,429
And if you get
it right, right?

765
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:49,309
So if I have if

766
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,269
you're able on
a PV, you know,

767
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:52,870
diagram to start
at something like

768
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,669
point A and go to point B,

769
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,190
if you know, you know,
that's pretty bad.

770
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,309
That's like a
parametric plot.

771
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,629
You know, but if you know

772
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:03,189
basically this whole path,

773
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,869
then the work
is nothing but

774
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:07,629
the entire area under

775
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:09,789
that integral, all right.

776
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:20,680
Questions about
that? Cool.

777
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,079
Great. All
right. So again,

778
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,359
that's about the process

779
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,839
there, something
like A to B.

780
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,359
If we then go, you know,

781
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,799
full circle, so
I could say,

782
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,079
okay, let's stick with,

783
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:35,560
you know, things that
are constant pressure.

784
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,680
So this isobaric case
of work transfer,

785
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,320
let's say all my heating

786
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,720
is done, right,
isochorically.

787
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,559
So that's the case where I

788
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,560
don't do work transfer,

789
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,079
and I'm only transferring
heat in and out.

790
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,599
So the du is just
equal to dc.

791
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,720
I can end up with

792
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,399
a rectangle that looks
like this, all right?

793
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,769
And why is this important?

794
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:01,570
So if I think about,
let's say the process

795
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,930
of I bear compression,

796
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,089
you know, if I think
about this is A to B,

797
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,489
C to D, so here,

798
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:14,569
what I have at the
lower pressure is I

799
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,169
have, expansion
process, right?

800
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:19,449
I have some work
below that's done.

801
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,730
I have C to D here, some
compression process.

802
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,499
I could take the
area under that.

803
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:28,069
What's important to
know about a cycle is

804
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:30,829
then the area that's
shaded in between, okay?

805
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,950
So if you take the
entire integral

806
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,749
and you end up on

807
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:35,309
that cycle to
where you start,

808
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:37,790
it's the shaded area
on something like

809
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:42,109
a PV diagram that's
relevant, okay?

810
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:43,149
We'll call that. You know,

811
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:44,309
in the future, we'll
get through it.

812
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:46,629
But essentially, it can

813
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:47,949
tell you about the
network, right?

814
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:49,149
Because again,
this process

815
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:51,189
here on the bottom would

816
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,849
be the network
transferred in, or out.

817
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:57,050
The one below here is

818
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,409
the amount transferred in,

819
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:01,010
and then the
difference is what we

820
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,649
call is the network, okay?

821
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:05,729
In your car, that's
like go, right?

822
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:07,169
So that's like, you

823
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:09,689
know, what you
get out of it.

824
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:11,609
What's more subtle and

825
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:12,809
not exactly
clear, you know,

826
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,129
here at the moment is that

827
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,089
when you do a full
cycle like that,

828
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,369
the network that you have

829
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,409
out must be equal to

830
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:23,399
the net heat that you
transfer in, okay?

831
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,349
And the reason is
that you need to

832
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,669
end up at the same
initial state.

833
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,350
You can't have any
change in energy.

834
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,590
So whatever you
have out must be

835
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,830
equal to ultimately

836
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,469
what's transferred
in, okay?

837
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:35,669
That'll become clear.

838
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,189
Yeah, I can't
emphasize this enough,

839
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:47,469
but heat and work are

840
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:48,949
just transfer mechanisms.

841
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:50,989
These are not properties

842
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:51,629
that should be made

843
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:53,029
clear because
these things are,

844
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,829
you know, properties,
but that whole area

845
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:55,669
under it is what

846
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,829
represents the
work, all right?

847
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,890
Cool.

848
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,730
Again, these things
happen at boundaries,

849
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,409
like I showed you,

850
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,009
um, you know, there,

851
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:05,250
especially with
the cylinder.

852
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,729
This is kind of
an obvious one

853
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:08,489
where this is happening

854
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,050
at a boundary and
it's pushing it down.

855
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,209
These boundaries
can shrink.

856
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,889
So these control
volumes that

857
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:14,889
I show you here,
this dashed lines,

858
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:17,129
just like I did
with the blue,

859
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:19,729
it's just for
completeness, right?

860
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:21,129
I could show that
this is then the

861
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,170
new, um, you know,

862
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,529
blue boundary after,

863
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,790
um, you know,
moving it down,

864
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,790
these things can
basically shrink

865
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,989
and expand, you know,

866
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:31,909
with them, but work in

867
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:33,189
heat then are
always happening

868
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:36,189
at at a boundary, okay?

869
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:37,509
And I emphasize, you know,

870
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:38,949
that they path, right?

871
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:40,390
The way to visualize path.

872
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,230
Why is it a path function?

873
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,869
Because this is
the path, right?

874
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,750
Yeah. I tried to

875
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,589
make that also clear

876
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:52,829
here that the
point is that,

877
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:54,349
you know, until we
know, you know,

878
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:55,749
complete information then

879
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:58,349
about the path, right,

880
00:30:58,349 --> 00:30:59,150
we're going to say

881
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,789
for the path
functions that

882
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:04,659
they're basically little
delta, all right.

883
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,289
I think the book is

884
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:07,369
pretty consistent on this,

885
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:11,769
but if you go on the
Internet and read,

886
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,489
all right,

887
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,289
not everyone is super
consistent with

888
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,609
theta with the Delta
notation, all right?

889
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,049
Okay. I can show
this one again.

890
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,130
So just to remind you

891
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,209
a little bit about sort of

892
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:24,649
these differences
in the past,

893
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,529
why we care
about the path,

894
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:28,930
you know, consider this
expansion process.

895
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,569
So here we're
starting off with

896
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:32,730
the same temperature
and the same volume,

897
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,049
and what I want
you to focus on

898
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,569
is the work
transfer, all right?

899
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,049
Here you have reversible,

900
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:38,329
no heat transfer in,

901
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,970
so reversible adiabatic,

902
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,930
and on the right here,

903
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:45,249
irreversible and
adiabatic, right?

904
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,409
All right. And so, again,

905
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,090
you basically have
the same conditions,

906
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,170
but you have differences

907
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,289
in the final
state, all right?

908
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:55,009
So you have differences
in the temperatures,

909
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,410
differences in the volume.

910
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,690
And as a result of that,

911
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,930
you have differences
in the amount

912
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,409
of work transferred, okay?

913
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:01,769
Someone raising their hand

914
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:03,729
or no? Phantom hand?

915
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:07,409
Cool. All right.
Yes. All right.

916
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:09,089
So just to
really, you know,

917
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,719
uh, be a broken
record here, right?

918
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,559
So here we have same

919
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,079
initial state, same final,

920
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,879
just like I showed
on the other plots,

921
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:18,040
right with these different
process A process.

922
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,600
B, right, in process
A, with the green,

923
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,879
you have less area below
it versus process B,

924
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:25,879
where you have
more area, right?

925
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,079
So in one of them, you

926
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,640
have more work transferred

927
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,119
out of your system

928
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,640
than the other
case, right?

929
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,309
Cool. Yeah, I
think I said this.

930
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,269
Yeah. So here,
you know, again,

931
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:42,709
so we did this with
the Delta Vs, right?

932
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:44,669
So volume rate
is a property.

933
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:46,269
So we can write
it that way.

934
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:48,109
Whereas, you know,
with Delta W,

935
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:49,789
when you integrate
it, it's W one,

936
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:53,709
two, and not Delta
Delta W. All right.

937
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:55,029
Um, let's get to

938
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:56,149
an example because I'm

939
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:57,429
getting a little
bit bored.

940
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:04,019
So, um You know,
here, right?

941
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:06,259
So when you set up
a problem, right?

942
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,819
And we'll get
to the one in

943
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,699
a I'm going start to
draw the one here,

944
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:11,099
and then it'll
help us, right?

945
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:12,019
So the first stage

946
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:14,339
here look at
this problem is,

947
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,659
you're going to
draw this box,

948
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:19,299
this beautiful box that

949
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:20,699
someone put a
propeller in.

950
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:24,779
I guess it could be a
fan, you know, do that.

951
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:25,459
So we have this

952
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:30,020
beautiful, you
know, propeller.

953
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,539
Okay, so I'm following
this part right.

954
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,219
When I analyze this
thing, all right?

955
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:38,939
So I'm going to draw
then within here,

956
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:44,095
this, um Let's
control volume.

957
00:33:44,095 --> 00:33:45,249
With that.

958
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:46,810
So basically with
the control volume,

959
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,650
I'm drawing the
boundaries.

960
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,770
You know, with that,
in this problem,

961
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,169
I'm saying that I have
some Q out, right?

962
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:56,529
So I have some
heat that's being

963
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:59,409
transferred, you
know, out of that.

964
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:01,849
I'm told that
I'm transferring

965
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:05,169
some work into that.

966
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,490
So we have some
work that's

967
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,449
being it's basically being

968
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,689
transferred, you
know, into that.

969
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:14,690
We're told that we have
here, like a fluid,

970
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,289
a known fluid, and

971
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,329
they tell us about
our states, right?

972
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:22,169
So we have this process.

973
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:25,689
So it's state one, Okay?

974
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,889
I'm told that
I know U one,

975
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:34,770
U is equal to 800,
you know, kilojoules.

976
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,769
And I don't think I

977
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:38,409
have any other information

978
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,490
except that the
Q out is 500,

979
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,689
you know, kilojoules
and my n is

980
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:48,129
equal to 100
kilojoules, right?

981
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,769
So how do you analyze
this problem?

982
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:56,089
So you draw this
control volume here.

983
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:57,209
And this is going to

984
00:34:57,209 --> 00:35:00,569
be essentially, you know,

985
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:04,009
any changes in
energy into here,

986
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:11,869
we're going to call
as Delta E S, okay?

987
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:14,849
All right. All right.

988
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,409
So this is, you know,

989
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:18,449
when I teach this
before, this is

990
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,089
like your bank
account, okay?

991
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:23,209
You can have credits.

992
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:25,609
You can have debits.

993
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:27,449
This one sure
looks like a lot

994
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,569
is going out and a lot
less is coming in.

995
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:31,690
That's what happens
when I go to Safeway.

996
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,529
So, you know, so you have

997
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:35,689
a lot more out than you

998
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:37,609
have, you know,
in there, okay?

999
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,289
And just like
accounting, again, yeah,

1000
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:41,170
we're interested
in the credit.

1001
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,769
So for the credits
that come in, right,

1002
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:45,729
we're going to call this
as E in, all right?

1003
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,769
And then this is going
to be subtracted

1004
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:51,849
by E out, all right?

1005
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,630
So I think that's
pretty straightforward,

1006
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,669
the amount that you have

1007
00:35:55,669 --> 00:35:56,869
the change in
what you have

1008
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:59,349
here in this
control volume is

1009
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:01,709
equal to the energy
we transferred

1010
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:05,389
in minus the energy
that we transfer out.

1011
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:06,829
What are the ways that we

1012
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:08,989
can transfer energy in?

1013
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,549
Work in heat. So
we can call this

1014
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:15,229
as like, I don't know,

1015
00:36:15,229 --> 00:36:22,509
Q in Q in plus W in

1016
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:32,749
minus Q out plus
W out? Okay.

1017
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,269
Do we have any heat

1018
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:38,989
being transferred
into this?

1019
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,029
No.

1020
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:43,549
There's no heat
transferred in,

1021
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,509
Is there work
transferred in?

1022
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:48,269
Yes. Is there heat
transferred out?

1023
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:51,229
Is there work
transferred out? No.

1024
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:53,989
What you rewrite this
then as saying, Okay,

1025
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:55,429
the change in the
system is then going

1026
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:57,189
to be equal to W

1027
00:36:57,189 --> 00:37:02,949
in minus Q out?

1028
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:08,209
Cool. All right.

1029
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:09,809
That looks good.

1030
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:12,249
How do we deal with

1031
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:16,889
the energy of this
system though?

1032
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,580
Okay. So we can go
with the initial.

1033
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,259
So the initial would be

1034
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:31,219
what like E one, right?

1035
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:39,339
Okay. Say it again, sorry.

1036
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:46,619
Yes. Yeah. And then

1037
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:52,940
it's state two plus.

1038
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,659
I'm not sure to follow.

1039
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,779
So let's talk
about this. So if

1040
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:04,499
I just say about
the Delta E system,

1041
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,059
and if I wrote E one here,

1042
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:09,139
what would one
naively write here?

1043
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,659
E two, right? Okay.

1044
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:13,979
And how would we

1045
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:15,459
represent let's
stay with E one.

1046
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,179
So what do you think
E one is equal to?

1047
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,659
Exactly. So more
specifically, right,

1048
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,259
in our case, E one is
equal to E one, right?

1049
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:28,019
And you could say,
Professor, why is that?

1050
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:30,179
I could say refer
to lecture one A.

1051
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:33,059
Or what I could say is
that in this system,

1052
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,179
You know, the
only energy that

1053
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:38,299
we can store is like
thermal, right?

1054
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:40,020
I don't have a lot
of kinetic energy.

1055
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,499
Probably actually,
if you look at

1056
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,579
a kinetic energy is

1057
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:44,459
like kinetic energy
means, I don't know,

1058
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:46,899
throwing a rock
or, you know,

1059
00:38:46,899 --> 00:38:47,779
the fluid is only

1060
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:51,140
basically possessing
internal energy.

1061
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,019
But it could be that

1062
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:53,179
if we pump this
really high,

1063
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:54,540
maybe you might have
potential energy

1064
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,699
or kinetic energy, right?

1065
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:58,219
But right now, it's
only, you know,

1066
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:01,779
we don't have,
you know, E.

1067
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,340
No, we don't have
potential energy.

1068
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,019
KE or PE, we don't
have that, okay?

1069
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:09,579
Cool. What about U E two?

1070
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,454
What would E two
be equal to?

1071
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:12,209
U two.

1072
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:14,489
You two, right? Not
the band. All right.

1073
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:16,809
So here you have then U

1074
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:19,889
two minus U
one, all right?

1075
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,969
And if we
rearrange this or

1076
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:23,209
if I write on a
different part

1077
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:24,489
of the board, basically,

1078
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,729
right U two would
be equal to

1079
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:33,164
U one plus W in
minus Q out, right?

1080
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:37,120
And we know one is
800 kilojoules.

1081
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,360
W in is 100 kilojoules,

1082
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,519
Q out is 500
kilojoules, right?

1083
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:52,639
So I have 800 plus
100 is 900 -500.

1084
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,320
So that should be
400 kilojoules

1085
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,439
is equal to
two, all right?

1086
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,649
That's pretty much
the class, okay?

1087
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:07,249
Like, everything else
is just going to get

1088
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:08,970
more I mean,
it'll get cooler.

1089
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,209
Like,

1090
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:10,129
we'll definitely get into,

1091
00:40:10,129 --> 00:40:11,089
like, neater things,

1092
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,249
but, right, that's
pretty much it.

1093
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:15,089
Like this is, again,

1094
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:16,129
thermo accounting, right?

1095
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:17,410
I have this
control volume.

1096
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,930
So the change in the
amount of energy

1097
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,929
stored here is
equal to how much

1098
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,730
I put into it minus

1099
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,539
how much I take
out of it, okay?

1100
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:27,749
Um, all right.

1101
00:40:27,749 --> 00:40:29,469
You'll also notice
here that I started to

1102
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,789
write things like
Qn, Wn, Q out,

1103
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:33,869
and W. That's because

1104
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:35,309
I spent a long time in

1105
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:36,750
a German speaking country,

1106
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,229
and they love things to be

1107
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:39,989
perfectly accurate.
All right?

1108
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,629
So just writing, like,
Delta, you know,

1109
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:44,470
E is equal to Q minus

1110
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,709
W implicitly
means that, like,

1111
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,189
in that case,
so what is Q,

1112
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:51,199
Q, If it's positive
means heat in.

1113
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,679
If Q is negative,
it means heat out.

1114
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,359
If W is positive,
it means work in.

1115
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:58,079
If W is out, it means

1116
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,880
work is positive. It
sounds exhausting.

1117
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,919
I'm like, my face hurts
talking this much.

1118
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,560
So I am going to generally

1119
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,519
be very explicit
about Q in,

1120
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,479
W in and that, okay?

1121
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:08,799
What does this
mean in terms

1122
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,159
of sine convention?

1123
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,519
It means that
these are always

1124
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:12,799
positive
quantities, right?

1125
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:14,439
So if I'm writing it
in this way, right?

1126
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,000
So this is energy in,
right, that's positive.

1127
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,439
This is energy out, the

1128
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:19,679
negative is there, okay?

1129
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,159
So that also simplifies,
you know, with it.

1130
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,799
Yes, please.

1131
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,909
You find a way to get
work out of this?

1132
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:35,030
We can start a company.
I'm I'm at a loss.

1133
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,789
So most of the time.

1134
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,029
No, it's not true. I mean,

1135
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,829
I'm just saying that
this is a thing.

1136
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:42,229
You know, if
you want to get

1137
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:43,830
work out of a propeller,

1138
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,590
you know, how
do we normally

1139
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,830
get work out of
a propeller?

1140
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:54,190
Yes, please. Yes,
you move a fluid.

1141
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,549
You basically hit it,
right? Like, you know,

1142
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:57,270
I got a little more
of the turbines.

1143
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,789
You move a fluid, it

1144
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:00,789
hits that, and then
it moves, right?

1145
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:01,909
That's generally how you

1146
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:02,669
want to learn
more about that.

1147
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:03,910
You take AI 146.

1148
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,710
I usually I taught
that last spring.

1149
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,270
So yeah, you
move the fluid,

1150
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,989
and then from
that, you can

1151
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:10,149
extract work from

1152
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:11,709
the kinetic energy
of the air, right?

1153
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,229
So that moving
energy of the air,

1154
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:14,389
you transfer that into

1155
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,349
the blade, and, you know,

1156
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:17,029
you spin, you know,

1157
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:19,749
a generator and
get that, okay?

1158
00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:21,549
And that's foreshadowing
what's to come.

1159
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:22,709
But in that case,
you need air

1160
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:23,829
to be moving in, right?

1161
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:25,869
Now, I can't bring
air in, right?

1162
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:27,589
I got a I got

1163
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:30,284
a stuffy room here with
a fan spinning, okay?

1164
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:30,939
Yeah.

1165
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:32,659
It's also an interesting
thing because if

1166
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:33,659
you think about
this problem,

1167
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:34,939
this is what
you would have.

1168
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:36,699
Well, on a hot day, right,

1169
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:39,379
you'd have more Q
in, right to it.

1170
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:40,619
But if you just
basically spin

1171
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:41,779
a fan in the room, right,

1172
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:43,580
you're heating up
the room slowly

1173
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,219
because you're transferring
work into that,

1174
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:46,659
and over time,
it might make

1175
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:48,099
you feel cooler,
but over time,

1176
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,899
if you had no way to
get the heat out,

1177
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:51,539
that's not an that's

1178
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:53,179
not a winning
solution, okay?

1179
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:57,899
Alright, cool. Other
questions about this?

1180
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,059
We're crawl. Pretty soon

1181
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:03,819
we're going to be
walking. All right.

1182
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,899
Yeah, that's what I
mentioned before.

1183
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:09,059
Again, when we represent

1184
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:11,419
an entire cycle
on a PV diagram,

1185
00:43:11,419 --> 00:43:14,779
and we take the shaded
area of that there,

1186
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:19,139
that was the net heat in.

1187
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:21,299
I could make an
argument about it with

1188
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,419
this one if I put
this to what's best.

1189
00:43:24,419 --> 00:43:25,859
I put this here and

1190
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:28,059
I put this one
to the side.

1191
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,619
Okay let's erase this.

1192
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,039
All right. And
so we have here,

1193
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:51,079
we wrote our Delta E,

1194
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,320
um, you know,
system is equal

1195
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,119
to E in minus E out.

1196
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,400
We said the E
in is Wn plus

1197
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,159
Q minus W out plus Q out.

1198
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:13,279
We said for the E
system that this would

1199
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:16,609
be, um, there, okay?

1200
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:18,169
So, okay, that's good.

1201
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:20,529
So that's a fact.
I'll write that.

1202
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:23,370
If I have this
as a PV diagram,

1203
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,529
and let's say I have

1204
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:25,969
this state to this state,

1205
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:28,289
to this state,
to this state.

1206
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:30,449
So this is one,
two, three,

1207
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:34,290
and four, okay?
And it's a cycle.

1208
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,209
I'm going to start at

1209
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,529
one and I finish at one,

1210
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:38,209
just like a
track, all right?

1211
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,969
You run around it, you

1212
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,729
end up where you
started, okay?

1213
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:42,849
I love that sport,

1214
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,369
but, you know, it's
kind of weird.

1215
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:46,209
Like you just like syphis,

1216
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:46,889
you just, like, keep

1217
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:48,210
pushing a rock
up, alright?

1218
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,089
The point, though,
is that there is

1219
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:52,969
no change in the system
in a cycle, right?

1220
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:54,329
Because you're
going to have you

1221
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:58,149
one minus, You won.

1222
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,749
It's zero, right?

1223
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:02,429
So then if I
rearrange this,

1224
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,749
then I can define
something for you,

1225
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:06,589
let's say W net
is equal to W

1226
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:10,729
out, minus W in,

1227
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:13,809
and let's say Q
net is equal to

1228
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:18,329
Q in minus two
minus Q out.

1229
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:21,649
So if I rearrange this,

1230
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:23,049
I put that to
the other side.

1231
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:24,729
So this equation,
I'm going to

1232
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:27,609
have W out minus

1233
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:35,649
Wn is then equal
to Qn minus Q out,

1234
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:42,474
which is just W net is
equal to Q net. Okay?

1235
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:44,859
So I can write that
or you can just,

1236
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:46,059
like, look at your
plot and just say,

1237
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:46,940
I'm going to color.

1238
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,659
Like, it's, you know,

1239
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:49,100
kindergarten
and you color.

1240
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,580
You know,
mathematically, it's

1241
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,779
the same as what

1242
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:55,020
I'm saying here,
alright? Cool.

1243
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,259
So then this only

1244
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:57,659
applies then when
we're talking about

1245
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:00,939
heat and work interactions

1246
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:02,619
with a closed system.

1247
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:05,140
So no mass, no mass
there, alright?

1248
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,139
So, that's it. So
you should be able

1249
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,100
to talk about a cycle,
internal energy,

1250
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,379
go to a party
and talk about

1251
00:46:10,379 --> 00:46:12,220
heat and work transfer,

1252
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,420
work transfer processes.

1253
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,139
You're going to
blow them all away.

1254
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,859
So I'm going to
close it here.

1255
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,219
If you have any
questions, I'm up here.

1256
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:19,739
Thank you very much.
