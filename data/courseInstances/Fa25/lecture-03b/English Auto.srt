1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,279
All right, I got 210.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,040
So today we're
talking about

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,920
property tables
and ideal gas.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,160
Before we get started,

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,520
just some words.
All right.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,560
So in the first problem,

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,720
a lot of these problems,

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,139
when you do it Okay.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,180
So when you use problems

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,300
there, a lot of the ones,

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,139
especially when you like

12
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:24,979
property tables in that,

13
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:26,339
you're able to open
this workbook.

14
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:27,779
This workbook is
essentially like

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,339
a constrained
Jupyter notebook.

16
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:32,099
It has, like, pre
installed packages,

17
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,059
like PiKlor and
all of that.

18
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,859
Right? So if you open
that and launch it,

19
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:36,379
you're going to see

20
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,779
the actual Jupyter
Notebook there.

21
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:38,819
If you double click on it,

22
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:39,579
you have this
thing, right?

23
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,859
So in most of the
problems, you have

24
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,339
an identical template to

25
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:43,779
this also in the
practice ones,

26
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:45,259
and this is going to
be the same exact one

27
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,659
that you will see
in a quiz, right?

28
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,099
So the idea is that
you practice on

29
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:49,299
actually what
I'll test you on.

30
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,699
I'm not to trick you.

31
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,739
Like, not in this
class anyways, okay?

32
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,739
So yeah, if you
click on that,

33
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,659
you can then run through a

34
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,219
and see that? That's one.

35
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,659
The second thing is

36
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,459
that I don't see this now.

37
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:05,979
I did out of

38
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,939
these slides and
now I don't see it,

39
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:14,460
is that when you use Pi
Killor with numbers,

40
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,059
it needs units. This
is not a math class.

41
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,180
It may be quite mathy,
but it's engineering.

42
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,459
In engineering, you got
to give a unit to it.

43
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:22,899
And so a lot of the book

44
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,379
problems and all of
that will give things

45
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:28,179
an MPA as an input,
especially on pressure.

46
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:31,499
Calvin is an
input for like

47
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:33,660
a default input
for Pi killor

48
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,390
also as the um
as the output.

49
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,549
Unfortunately,
the default input

50
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,310
or fortunately,

51
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,389
it really depends
on the problem.

52
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:41,749
The default input in

53
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:43,309
pressure is
like KPA, okay?

54
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:44,669
So I recommend, you know,

55
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:45,949
when you work at
these problems, like,

56
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:47,749
declare your
units, you know,

57
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:49,189
if you have them in
there and, you know,

58
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,469
and sort of best
practice with that.

59
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:52,349
So if anyone had

60
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,709
trouble with a
problem like this,

61
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,589
especially a
programming one,

62
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:57,069
that's probably
the source of

63
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:59,190
the errors that you
haven't declared.

64
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,909
The unit for that,
you've just put

65
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:02,429
P equals, you know,

66
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:03,870
P and then not declared

67
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,069
that actually that
pressure variable

68
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,030
is an NPA, okay? Units.

69
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,490
Questions about
this? Okay. The GSI,

70
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,970
Cassiine McCormick
could post

71
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,009
like a YouTube video that

72
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,169
goes along with
the problem

73
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,570
from Homework one,

74
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,650
hopefully that'll
assist you, okay?

75
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,330
All right. So
are we today?

76
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,970
We're going to talk
about ideal gas, right?

77
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,410
Give it go deeper

78
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,130
into that and
how it stands in

79
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,050
contrast to other
equations of state

80
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,209
that you can use
and essentially

81
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,010
get into the ones
where we can

82
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,370
predict, like
phase transitions.

83
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,770
That's what we care
about with water, right?

84
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,929
The fact that
there is a phase

85
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:41,610
transition right
a lot of times.

86
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,410
And we'll also talk
about go deeper

87
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,250
into these two concepts
of this constant.

88
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,610
I said before, like Q
is equal to C Delta T,

89
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,489
the meaning of those C's.

90
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,769
All right? Okay,
so a refresher,

91
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,810
right, for a pure
substance, right?

92
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,890
Before, if I take

93
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,370
two independent
variables, right?

94
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,090
I can compute a
dependent one.

95
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,210
An ideal gas is,
um, let's say,

96
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,889
like air or nitrogen
is a pure substance.

97
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:03,810
So that means that if

98
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,009
I take pressure
and volume,

99
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:05,730
I should be able to know

100
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,809
temperature out
of there, right?

101
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:08,330
So PV I should be
able to get the,

102
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,810
um, uh, the
temperature of it.

103
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,610
If you want to, like,

104
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,849
understand the form
of the equation,

105
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,050
right? It's PV and T.

106
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,490
I put them on the
left hand side,

107
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,210
then that equation
should be equal to,

108
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,420
uh to zero, right?

109
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,870
Okay. There's
two ways that

110
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,390
you will see
the ideal gas.

111
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,870
Normally, how
it's taught in

112
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,110
chemistry is
like this form,

113
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,190
PV equals N, right,

114
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,750
which is moles, all right?

115
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,030
RU, which is

116
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,950
the universal gas
constant right in

117
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,110
joules per mole
per degrees

118
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,430
Celsius N times
temperature, all right?

119
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,830
So when you see it
in this form, right,

120
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,950
you need to take
care of the fact

121
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,230
that that N is in moles.

122
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,190
And remember that the
temperature here that

123
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,334
you're dealing with
is in what unit?

124
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,440
Kelvin, okay?

125
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,720
The way to check
yourself is, like,

126
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,320
put in Celsius at

127
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,200
the freezing point of

128
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,879
water or the melting
point of water.

129
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,280
And then, like, what is

130
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
the pressure that you

131
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,840
would have at
that condition?

132
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,239
What are, like, the two
potential solutions

133
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,320
to pressure that you could

134
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,639
have for substituting
zero degrees

135
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,560
Celsius into that formula?

136
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,079
Zero or Infinity, you
know, and beyond, okay?

137
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,800
So to avoid Buzz Aldrin

138
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,200
and whatever, you know,

139
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,039
type stuff there,

140
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,799
basically stay with
Kelvin, all right?

141
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:29,539
Um Okay, that's one thing,

142
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,739
right? It is related.

143
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,380
This universal
gas constant

144
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,499
in joules per mole per

145
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:39,300
keelvin can be defined
also in physics.

146
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,019
If you've seen it in
a physics context,

147
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,259
sometimes you
will see pv is

148
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,060
kt where N is the
number of molecules.

149
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,859
The K there is
Boltzman's constant.

150
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:49,259
Boltzman' constant, I told

151
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,859
you before it is jule
Kelvin Actually,

152
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:53,179
it's joule per
something per keelvin,

153
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:55,499
joule per molecule,
you know, with it.

154
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:57,789
And it's related to the

155
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:58,949
universal gas constant

156
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:00,389
through Abagro's constant,

157
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,270
right, 6.02 times
ten to the 23rd.

158
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,470
I learned that in
second grade I think

159
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,949
if I haven't forgot
that shit since, right?

160
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,749
So it's like in here
burned in. All right.

161
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:08,070
So you've got, you know,

162
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,749
this thing that you can

163
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:09,750
use to interchange between

164
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,910
the chemists approach and

165
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,989
the physicist approach,

166
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:14,389
namely with RU
and KB, right?

167
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,749
Um, Great. All right.

168
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:20,109
If we want to write the

169
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,789
chemist approach in
this class, right,

170
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,470
a lot of times

171
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,550
we're going to
be dealing with,

172
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,470
you know, maybe
specific volume.

173
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,869
When I have something
that is like,

174
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:32,829
a specific per mole,

175
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,669
I'm going to put a
bar above it, right?

176
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,589
So if I have my V
bar here, right,

177
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,109
this is going to mean
that it's meters

178
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:41,829
cubed per mole, right?

179
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,230
I'm not really going
to use this very much.

180
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,509
It's not really going
to come up again,

181
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,790
I think, until, like,

182
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,430
I don't know, combustion,

183
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,189
whenever that's a
distant future problem

184
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,789
for us, very distant.

185
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:52,429
But for now, right,

186
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:53,830
that's what the
bar will mean.

187
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,149
It doesn't mean,
like, a mean value.

188
00:05:55,149 --> 00:06:01,149
It means that it's on a
per mole basis, okay?

189
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,749
One thing. The second
thing is that,

190
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,919
um, a lot of

191
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,040
times, we're not
going to use this.

192
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,880
So how do we use it?

193
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,159
How do we typically
would use it?

194
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,159
Let's say we're going to

195
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,359
have P little V, right?

196
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,839
So that's going to
be meters cubed per

197
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,359
kilogram is equal to,

198
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,199
you know, let's say,

199
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,119
R times T, right?

200
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,519
This is one way or
we're going to see

201
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,079
P capital V is

202
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,324
equal to mass M
times R T, okay?

203
00:06:27,324 --> 00:06:32,449
Now, this R is not
universal, okay?

204
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:35,770
It depends on the
substance involved.

205
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,849
Actually, that was like a

206
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:38,569
problem historical
development of

207
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,969
the ideal gas equation is

208
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,809
no one could figure
out exactly what R is.

209
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,690
Also, interestingly,
in my reading,

210
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,249
no one is quite
sure why we use

211
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,549
R. Maybe a French guy,

212
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,149
you know, but, like,

213
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,669
so there's the
universal R,

214
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,629
and that is universal,
and that's per mole.

215
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,149
But as soon as we
get into this R,

216
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:59,549
at the unit of
this R is right,

217
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,270
it's going to be energy.

218
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,709
So it can be joule
or let's say,

219
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,069
a lot of times in the
book, you'll see,

220
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,229
like kilojoule per
kilogram elvin okay,

221
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:10,950
or kilojoule per
kilogram degree Celsius,

222
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,709
are the same, um, um,

223
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,629
right, one degree
change in Kelvin is

224
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,660
one degree change
in, uh, in Celsius.

225
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,539
So there's going to be

226
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,019
this value for
water, right?

227
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,899
There's going to be this
value for, you know,

228
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,779
whatever substance that
exists there, okay?

229
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,179
And obviously,
like in a quiz

230
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:27,459
or something,

231
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,419
I would just give
you this value.

232
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:30,019
I don't expect you
to memorize it.

233
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,579
I didn't learn that
in elementary school,

234
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:32,899
so I don't
remember it, okay?

235
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,609
Um, Cool.

236
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:37,049
So but that's basically
the difference.

237
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:37,849
So like I said,

238
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:39,129
we're going to be
using pretty much

239
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,449
for most of the time
this form of it.

240
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,049
You're gonna have

241
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:43,450
the specific gas
constant rate,

242
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,890
which depends on
the substance.

243
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,810
And these things
exist, like in a table

244
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,009
or in a you know,

245
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,049
you'll just have a
value, and it'll be

246
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,889
given normally in
the problem, okay?

247
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,890
Questions about
that? Yes, please.

248
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:06,669
Name in question.
An M. Okay.

249
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,549
The reason why I use an
M is because there's

250
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:09,789
an M in mechanical
engineering

251
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,109
and we are biased, okay?

252
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:13,029
The real reason is
that it's mass, right?

253
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,629
A lot of times we're
going to be dealing

254
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,589
like this problem
later on when we work.

255
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:17,909
Maybe there's some on a

256
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:19,630
mass of air
that's in here.

257
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,069
I'm a mass of water.

258
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,389
Don't my ruler stick
is not moles, right?

259
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:24,630
If told me to
tell you how many

260
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,629
moles of, you know,
stuff in here,

261
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,149
I wouldn't know
what to put, okay?

262
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,949
So we use M because
it's practical.

263
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:34,710
And a lot of

264
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,110
problems in mechanical
engineering.

265
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,710
Like, if you measure,
um, You know,

266
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,829
a lot of the systems and

267
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:40,949
instrumentations
are going to

268
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:42,149
be about weighing
things when

269
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:43,270
you're in the
industry, right?

270
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,189
I measure, like,
a mass flow rate.

271
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:46,750
You know, I don't
measure like

272
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,030
a molar a molar
flow rate, right?

273
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,190
Does that answer
your question or no?

274
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,670
Good. Other questions?

275
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,190
Okay. Cool.

276
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,150
Okay. Yes. Yeah, and

277
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,229
you can go back and
forth, right, you know,

278
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,229
from being in a molar,

279
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:10,550
from a molar basis to

280
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,749
a kilogram by using
the molar mass.

281
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,950
So that's exactly
how you get to

282
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,630
an R value like
this is you

283
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,389
would take the
universal gas constant,

284
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:21,390
you know, RU, right,

285
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,030
and transform it
using molar mass.

286
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,470
So that's the value for

287
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,070
carbon dioxide
there, okay?

288
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,350
Mostly informational,
but, you know,

289
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,190
I have to say it

290
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,630
because if there's
one equation,

291
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,789
the most abused
equation in this class,

292
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,789
it is this equation.

293
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,590
Okay? You're
going to do shit

294
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,790
like I want to use
this for water, okay?

295
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,349
And you shouldn't
do that, all right?

296
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:48,630
That's like a
no, no, alright.

297
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,310
We'll get into why you

298
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,469
don't use that
basically for water.

299
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:52,470
But the other way
that it's abused is

300
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,790
people are using
basically the right,

301
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,150
the wrong value for
the gas constant.

302
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,989
Allright? Yeah, so
where is this valid?

303
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:02,670
This equation,
right, is valid for

304
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,750
things with very
low density, right?

305
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,150
Is a liquid low
density? No, okay?

306
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,430
A liquid is about
1,000 times

307
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,910
denser than it's
like vapor form,

308
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,329
okay? One. So liquids?

309
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:19,010
No, definitely out
of the question.

310
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,849
When it comes to
gases, you know,

311
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:25,930
usually it's sort of
okay as long as you're

312
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,490
not approaching the point

313
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,250
where a gas will
condense, okay?

314
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,970
So that's exactly why

315
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,290
water vapor doesn't
work, right?

316
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,970
There's an attraction,
to it, okay?

317
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,889
And so, really the
conditions where you have

318
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:39,970
low density is you have a

319
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,209
vacuum, right,
low pressure.

320
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:42,730
So lower pressure
conditions

321
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,210
or at very high
temperature.

322
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,050
It's a pretty
decent equation.

323
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,329
And then these are
the substances

324
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:48,849
it works for right,
air, nitrogen,

325
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:52,170
oxygen, and so
on and so forth.

326
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,570
You probably haven't
seen like well,

327
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,090
maybe you've seen
a liquid version

328
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,450
of this. You've
seen a rocket.

329
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,770
I don't know about CO two.

330
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,530
But otherwise, you know,
most of these ones,

331
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,410
you never would have
seen a liquid form.

332
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,770
And water vapor and

333
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,610
refrigerants should not be

334
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,910
used because you know,

335
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,990
a lot of times
in our systems,

336
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,230
when we put in
the values of

337
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,069
pressure and temperature
that are relevant,

338
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:15,030
we're near a
saturation point.

339
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,189
We're basically
near a point

340
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:17,469
where they're
going to condense.

341
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,349
And this model doesn't

342
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:22,630
include an attractive
term, okay?

343
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,430
Yeah, so let's think
back again a bit.

344
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,069
Like, what is
an ideal gas?

345
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,230
An ideal gas is, like,

346
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,150
molecular dynamic
simulations you did, right?

347
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,509
A bunch of billard balls

348
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:32,390
that all they do is they

349
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,509
crash into each other
and they never stick,

350
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:37,490
right? They never
stick, right?

351
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,370
All you're doing
is writing, like,

352
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,249
you know, the
sum of forces,

353
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,009
you know, with
some point mass,

354
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,490
and they hit, but there's

355
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,810
never like a transfer of

356
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,170
that kinetic energy or

357
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,650
an attractor where
basically they

358
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,050
start to stay together.

359
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,490
And because of that, it

360
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,810
will not work for
water, right?

361
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,090
You need a different
equation of

362
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,729
state if you
wanted to then add

363
00:11:57,729 --> 00:12:02,170
an attractive term
to that, okay?

364
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,769
Yeah, so if there's
phase change

365
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,130
involved, no.

366
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,089
And by default,
in this class,

367
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,350
I swear to you
know, whatever.

368
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,350
You write the
ideal gas equation

369
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,790
for water, and
it's like a zero.

370
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,549
Like, I'm not even
I'm sympathetic.

371
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,109
I'm sympathetic
in so many ways.

372
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:17,629
But, like, you do
that, and it's like,

373
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:18,869
I need to send a message.

374
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,270
I've sent a message today,

375
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,230
but, you know, it's
just don't do it.

376
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,030
And especially don't
do it because you have

377
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,590
a thermo calculator to

378
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,390
deal with water, right?

379
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,550
Yeah. Okay.
Cool. All right.

380
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,390
Any questions about that?

381
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,830
Otherwise, I'll dive into

382
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,670
this beautiful
example here.

383
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,430
All right?

384
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,110
Okay. So what problem
are we looking at here?

385
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,830
We're looking at
a problem where

386
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,590
initially we have

387
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,430
some container of
volume V one, okay?

388
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,230
So I'm declaring,
like two containers.

389
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,310
One is container,
let's say,

390
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,630
capital I to the left,

391
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,350
Roman numeral
one to the left.

392
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,829
Then let's say
Roman numeral

393
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:00,070
two, you know,
to the right.

394
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,070
The volume of
Roman numeral one.

395
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,229
So this container
on the left is

396
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,670
equal to V one, all right?

397
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,710
And the volume on
this side is equal to

398
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,230
five times the
volume here, right?

399
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,990
So we'd say basically
five, five V one.

400
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,149
This side contains
mass, right?

401
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:20,150
So we have basically
some mass,

402
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,515
some gas or whatever
that's, um,

403
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:25,760
you know, ideal gas
that's in here.

404
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,400
And on this side, we
have a vacuum, alright?

405
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,320
The left hand
side, we say is

406
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,199
at 460 degrees Celsius.

407
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:34,560
Why not? And a pressure

408
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,120
P one that we don't know.

409
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,960
Alright? And what we're

410
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,840
going to do is we're

411
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,920
going to take
this partition.

412
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,000
So the thing separating

413
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,640
the left from the right,

414
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,680
we're gonna
remove it, right?

415
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,120
We're suddenly
going to remove it.

416
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,360
We're going to
let this gas

417
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,200
expand to the right
hand side. Fine.

418
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
And at the end
of this, what

419
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,920
we're going to do
is we're going to

420
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,720
transfer some
amount of heat into

421
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,440
this combined
system such that

422
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,680
the final pressure is

423
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,774
equal to the
initial pressure.

424
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,910
I'm exhausted saying that.

425
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,270
So who would bother

426
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,510
in their right mind
with doing this?

427
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,429
I asked myself as I

428
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,070
wrote all that
out and said it.

429
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,790
Jewel, right?

430
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,030
So I'll put this
to the side

431
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,510
so maybe it's easier
for everyone to

432
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,429
see Jewel James Jewel,

433
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,990
this was a problem
that really concerned

434
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,789
him, his thoughts, right?

435
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,470
Um, and it had to

436
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,630
do with the fact that if

437
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,629
you think about
sort of, you know,

438
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,590
these kind of ideal gas
relations and stuff,

439
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,590
and we're thinking
about how properties,

440
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,149
maybe like
internal energy,

441
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:33,750
might depend upon
temperature.

442
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,470
He was coming up with

443
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,789
kind of clever experiments

444
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,150
where he would keep,

445
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,469
you know, have a big
change in volume,

446
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:42,520
um, you know,
associated with,

447
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,320
you know, with
a process or

448
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
maybe a big change in

449
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
pressure associated
with the process.

450
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,680
And he wanted to see if
there was a change in

451
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,240
temperature with
that, right? There.

452
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,760
And I'll get to,
you know, in

453
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,720
the following part of
what his result was,

454
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,160
what he basically
learned that

455
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,000
ideal gases depend
on, all right?

456
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,640
Okay, so what can we do?

457
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,919
So I've got the values

458
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,520
here that I've
written, okay?

459
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,760
I've got, you know,

460
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,240
what I want to determine
what I've well,

461
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,639
maybe I can put
it to the middle.

462
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,580
Okay, into the middle.

463
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,540
But what I want to
determine is T two here.

464
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,860
I've got some
assumptions, right?

465
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,260
The other assumption
is that I'm going to

466
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,660
assume that this
is an ideal gas.

467
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,740
Okay. Now get rid of this.

468
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:36,260
We don't need this
anymore. Right?

469
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,860
Okay, I feel good
about this, right?

470
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,180
And we know that we have
this initial state,

471
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,860
in the final state
that we want to go to.

472
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,660
So the step one with
this is we'll go

473
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,579
to our, our physical laws.

474
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,339
So we'll say for the
initial state, right,

475
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,660
I'll have a P one
times a V one,

476
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,139
which is equal to the mass

477
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,979
one times the ideal
gas constant.

478
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:03,379
Um. I'm not sure

479
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,939
if we're told the
gas, but it's okay.

480
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:07,219
So we have some
value R, and then we

481
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:11,179
have T one there, okay?

482
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,819
And what we can also do is

483
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:16,179
we can write the
same equation at

484
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:17,939
state two when we're
in equilibrium.

485
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:21,459
So I can do p2v2 is equal

486
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:25,899
to two R times T two,

487
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,419
and we assume it's
the same gas,

488
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,379
so it's the same value of

489
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,819
R. We can do a
substitution, right?

490
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,059
So we know the volume

491
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,819
two as a function of
volume one, right?

492
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:42,180
So I would have,
P two times five.

493
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,860
You know, V one, that's

494
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,299
the partition that's on
the right hand side.

495
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,779
But if it's an
expansion process,

496
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:50,330
what's actually my total
volume? All right.

497
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,450
So if this is right, my

498
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,729
initial control volume

499
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:55,329
that I've drawn here
with my boundary,

500
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:57,649
and then I'm going to
allow that to expand.

501
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,850
You'll get some
nice colors.

502
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,249
So that's my state
control volume

503
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:05,569
from one if I then
expand that out,

504
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,450
you know, is basically
where we're at

505
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,729
that at state two.

506
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,610
And then this control
volume is what we,

507
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,489
you know, the size
of it for state one.

508
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:21,090
What's then the volume

509
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,809
at state two? So let
me write it this way.

510
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:28,279
So V two is equal to what?

511
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,309
661, right?

512
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:33,909
Yeah. Okay, so 61 there.

513
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:36,869
So this is plus
V one, right?

514
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,589
So six V one, and again,

515
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:43,949
that's equal to
R T two, okay?

516
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:48,390
So that's a pretty
decent equation.

517
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,469
And we have this one
here. What do we

518
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:54,799
know about P
two? It's P one.

519
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,120
Then we have
here P one times

520
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,919
six the one is
then equal to two.

521
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,479
Sorry, two R T two.

522
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,839
Now in this
process, we don't

523
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,360
have any mass transfer.

524
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,600
The amount of
mass that I have

525
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,279
here my initial state

526
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,960
is equal to the amount

527
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,159
that I have at
my final state.

528
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,479
So what I can do
then is I can just

529
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,599
call this I can leave it

530
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,439
as one or two or I can

531
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,879
just call it as if
I wanted it, right?

532
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:29,219
Now to compute T two
from this Let's see,

533
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:30,100
what we're going to do is

534
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,299
I'm going to take
equation one.

535
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:32,899
Let's call this
equation one.

536
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:35,099
And let's call this
then equation two,

537
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:36,619
and I'm going to take
the ratio, right?

538
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,500
So I'm going to take
the ratio of equation

539
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,939
two divided by
equation one.

540
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,499
And so what I'll
have here then,

541
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,619
right is P one,

542
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:56,779
six, V one is equal to
two R T two, right?

543
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,460
And both sides
are then divided

544
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,379
by P one times,

545
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:02,859
right? This is V one.

546
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,499
And then on the right
hand side, right,

547
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:09,380
I have one R T one, right?

548
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,460
Is this visible?

549
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,180
No, not visible.

550
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,339
Yeah, that's visible.
This part is.

551
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:17,579
Okay. Maybe I'll just go

552
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:20,219
to full screen
for a second.

553
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,149
Hmm. Okay. Now,
what cancels here,

554
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:27,029
right is we're going
to lose the V one,

555
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:28,789
which is out, right?

556
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:30,070
There's no mass transfer,

557
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,070
so the M's are the
same. Idel gas.

558
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,189
We assume that
there's no change

559
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:36,829
in the composition of

560
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:38,309
the ideal gas that
we have there.

561
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:39,670
So the R goes away.

562
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,589
And so then if we
rearrange, what do I have?

563
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,829
And also the
pressure, right?

564
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:49,709
So here, the pressures
also drop, right?

565
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:52,309
So the pressures drop,
and it's like that.

566
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:54,189
And so then what
we'll have is that T

567
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:56,829
one or T two is going

568
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:02,509
to be equal to six
times T one, right?

569
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,989
I think. Yeah.
Pretty right.

570
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:09,389
Sure. Yes, please.

571
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,869
So what did I say was
on this side, though?

572
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:23,390
The vacuum,
right? So vacuum,

573
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,109
you know, here
and you do that.

574
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,110
Okay. The other way
that this experiment

575
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,230
is done is if you've seen,

576
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,229
like, a shock tube.

577
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,670
So if you ever
want to study

578
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,109
the species that
come out of, like,

579
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,950
the end of a rocket
nozzle and all of that,

580
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,549
they do these really
cool experiments

581
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:37,750
where you basically
generate,

582
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,629
like, a shock wave there.

583
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:40,909
And the way that you
can do that is you

584
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:42,429
have really high pressure
up here and then,

585
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:44,149
like a very thin
membrane that you like,

586
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:45,469
blow open, and then you

587
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:47,070
can watch the
shock and measure,

588
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,550
like, evolution and
cool stuff like that.

589
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,589
So for the aero
students in the room.

590
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:54,789
Yes. Yes, please.

591
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,230
Yeah, I mean, it's math.

592
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,029
You can do that, but
then at the end of it,

593
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:07,989
you wanted T two as
some form of that.

594
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:11,029
Yeah. Other questions?

595
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:17,380
No. Okay. Yeah,
and I'm assuming,

596
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,140
right, that you can
do the substitution.

597
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,179
It's just important
that for T one, right,

598
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,580
when we do the
substitution,

599
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,260
that T one, what
is it equal to?

600
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,819
We said two or
460 degrees C

601
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:35,499
plus 273.15 there,

602
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:38,539
and then that'll get
you into Kelvin, right?

603
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:39,419
So you basically have to

604
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,700
multiply six times that,

605
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,659
and then you'll
have actually a

606
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,340
very large that's
a pretty six,

607
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,460
it's like seven, that's

608
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,500
like a number approaching

609
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,820
the temperature
of the sun.

610
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,140
That'd be a fun
experiment.

611
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,179
Okay. Great. All right,

612
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:56,340
so if there's no
other questions

613
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,379
then with that,
we'll move on.

614
00:21:58,379 --> 00:21:59,739
So what I'll do now with

615
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,499
this while I get
myself set up is,

616
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:02,579
again, kind of
repeating on

617
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:04,820
the property value
determination.

618
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,619
Hopefully, some of you
had had a chance to

619
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:09,459
try with the
PCulor otherwise,

620
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:12,620
you're free to go, you
know, with the table.

621
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,379
So in this problem,

622
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:14,580
what you're going
to start off with

623
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,579
is a superheated vapor
at this condition.

624
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:19,699
You're going to
cool it down with

625
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:20,819
constant pressure until

626
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,259
it's a saturated vapor.

627
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,859
And the question
here, there's two.

628
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,339
The first is, what

629
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:26,980
is T two for the
water vapor?

630
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,779
And then what would T

631
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,060
two be for the ideal gas?

632
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,099
And the idea out of
that second part is to

633
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,299
compare and contrast
what the ideal gas is

634
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,299
able to do for you
versus what is

635
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:38,299
actually the ground
truth for that, okay?

636
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,339
I have to launch
this, so just

637
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,100
bear with me of
any substance.

638
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,980
In this case, the
equals to one,

639
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,379
an ideal gas equation

640
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:46,459
is not going to
cut it, right?

641
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:47,419
How much air did I

642
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:48,819
say was allowed
in this class?

643
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,899
2%, okay? That's
much more than 2%.

644
00:22:51,899 --> 00:23:00,499
Okay? Great. Any questions
about this? Okay.

645
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:03,099
Cool. So if you

646
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:05,459
do want to use an equation
of state, though,

647
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:07,739
to get at this process of

648
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:11,939
interaction and
condensation there,

649
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,699
you can add an
attractor term.

650
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:16,060
So you can take the
ideal gas equation,

651
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,219
go in and put a
term that says,

652
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:18,580
Hey,

653
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,419
the molecules now like
each other, right?

654
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:23,780
They're not indifferent
to each other.

655
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,099
They like each
other. And this

656
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,780
was the work of
Vandervals, right?

657
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,820
So Vander Walls,

658
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,300
maybe you've heard
of it before.

659
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,979
But he did his like,

660
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:33,059
doctoral dissertation
on this,

661
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,659
which actually, if
you look at it,

662
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:36,779
is kind of
unbelievable, right?

663
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:38,499
I mean, So what?

664
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:40,140
Like, 26-years-old,
you know,

665
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,739
going in there and
then writing this up.

666
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,419
And all at a time

667
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:45,699
when people weren't
really sure that,

668
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,019
like, Adams
existed, right?

669
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,340
So if you read about,
like, people like

670
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,419
Ernest Mach of
the Mach number,

671
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:52,379
Mach didn't believe
in the Adam, right?

672
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:53,619
So he was a positivist.

673
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:54,579
He thought if you couldn't

674
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:56,100
measure something,
it didn't exist.

675
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,979
Or, you know, it
can't you know,

676
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,660
it's not even a question,

677
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,299
you know, worth
asking there.

678
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,540
But Vandervo' probably

679
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,659
because he was
young, you know?

680
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:05,860
He's like, Okay, I don't

681
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,180
care what those
old guys think.

682
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,989
But, um, you know,

683
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,749
so you went in
and did it, okay?

684
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:11,989
So that's one part. So you

685
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:13,149
had, like, an
attractor term.

686
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:14,910
The other thing is that
with an ideal gas,

687
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,429
the gas molecules
don't occupy a volume.

688
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:18,950
Even if I show you
that Biller bolt

689
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,949
simulation, they
don't have a volume.

690
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:22,189
They're point
sources, okay?

691
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:23,469
So if you want to
get this right,

692
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:24,349
especially when you

693
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:25,670
look into the condensation

694
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,189
and processes like that,

695
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:27,709
they have to have

696
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:29,819
a finite volume
to them, okay?

697
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:33,249
Okay. So B is
the volume term.

698
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:35,530
So that says that
there's a finite volume

699
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,369
to these atoms
or molecules.

700
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:41,849
And the AV squared
term is the attractor.

701
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:42,849
This is basically what

702
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,729
says that at some point,

703
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:47,089
there's some amount of

704
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,089
that we like each
other, right?

705
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,090
So if I plot a PV diagram,

706
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,875
so let's say I take, um,

707
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,660
you know, a high
temperature,

708
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,379
let's say I take

709
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,099
the temperature at
the critical point

710
00:24:57,099 --> 00:25:02,259
for for water,
okay, right?

711
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:03,739
I can produce a plot

712
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:05,140
that shows this
behavior, right?

713
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,700
This is nothing but Pi
killor and computing,

714
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,260
and that's like
how my isotherm

715
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,179
would look like in
a PV diagram, okay?

716
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,379
If I now take Vander
Wall's formula,

717
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:17,099
which I had before, okay,

718
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,859
I take that and I
can compute A and B.

719
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,459
I'll go into a second
how you compute

720
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:23,539
those A and B constants,

721
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:24,580
but I can compute them.

722
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,459
And the red line,
so the blue line

723
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,620
is Pi killor the
water properties,

724
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,364
and the red line is
Vandervals, okay?

725
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,189
Right? So, without, like,

726
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:35,949
any knowledge of an atom,

727
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:37,469
right, math and, like,

728
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,029
a bit of creative thinking

729
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,590
and some understanding

730
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,749
on things that were
measured, right,

731
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,349
he produced a line
that looked like that,

732
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:45,549
which I write a
lot of papers,

733
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,150
and that's pretty like
that's pretty not bad.

734
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,429
That's like our
better than our

735
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:51,029
2% error kind
of, you know,

736
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:52,309
without knowing
anything, getting to

737
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:54,469
that level is
pretty good, right?

738
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,189
Captures the trends
and all of that.

739
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,310
So that's pretty neat.

740
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,079
One, So that's the
super critical point.

741
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:03,999
Now, you can go in

742
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,319
and start to look
at this process.

743
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,439
You can analyze

744
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,519
this equation
when you actually

745
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,720
get near the
phase transition,

746
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,279
which I mentioned

747
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,600
before is what's
interesting.

748
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,920
So the blue line
here, so we'll

749
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,159
go to a lower temperature.

750
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,480
Let's say 90% of the
critical temperature,

751
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,119
which is 647
Kelvin for water.

752
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,919
I can plot the
blue line, right?

753
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,119
So I have the
blue line, right?

754
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm decreasing my
specific volume.

755
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,240
I hit a quality
of one of vapor.

756
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,839
I get to quality
of zero, right?

757
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,200
It's a saturated liquid,

758
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,199
and then I shoot up.

759
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,354
That's all fine and well.

760
00:26:32,354 --> 00:26:34,189
You go through your
Vandervals, right?

761
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:36,309
That looks pretty good
until we get kind

762
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:38,550
of to the
saturated regime.

763
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,990
It overshoots.

764
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,590
It then undershoots,

765
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,429
and then it shoots
back up, okay?

766
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:45,550
And you could
say to yourself,

767
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,429
that's a pretty, like,
shitty model, right?

768
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:47,990
I look at that.

769
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,709
Like, actually, you,

770
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:49,669
you were raving
about this,

771
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,469
and maybe that guy
shouldn't have passed with

772
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:53,949
his PhD, you know, there.

773
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:54,510
But there's

774
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,669
some interesting
features of this.

775
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:57,590
So the first is that
at least he tried

776
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,629
to hit the dome here,
you know, with it.

777
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:02,099
Um, And

778
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:03,460
one thing that's
interesting about this,

779
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,660
and now this is
just me being

780
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,939
like an older guy
telling stories.

781
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:07,179
So if you want
to go to sleep,

782
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:08,620
you can, but I think
it's interesting.

783
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,980
You can go from this point

784
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,739
C to D, okay, right?

785
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:12,979
It's still kind
of moving with

786
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,179
a similar slope that
you had here coming in.

787
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,859
And B to A, right?

788
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:18,739
It's moving with kind
of a similar slope as

789
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:20,819
it exits from
the dome, right?

790
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,179
But from B to C,

791
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:24,099
you have an
inversion, okay?

792
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,580
And what's the consequence

793
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,699
of this, all right?

794
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:29,539
So from A to B and C to D,

795
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:31,620
so the change in pressure

796
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,899
divided by the change in

797
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,140
volume for a constant

798
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,099
temperature is
negative, okay?

799
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:37,619
Now, that makes
sense, right?

800
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:39,339
If I take something and

801
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,619
I increase the
volume, right?

802
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,419
So let's say that
experiment we did before,

803
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:44,620
I increased the volume.

804
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,179
Without heat addition, I

805
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,860
would expect a
decrease in pressure.

806
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,259
That's a negative
slope, right?

807
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,139
So DPDV should
be negative.

808
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:54,060
However, this shows
positive, right?

809
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,499
So that means, like, as I

810
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,060
would increase the volume,

811
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,585
the pressure should go up.

812
00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:00,589
And that makes no
fucking sense, right?

813
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:02,069
That doesn't make
any sense, okay?

814
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:05,029
So this, probably B
to C, is not allowed.

815
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:08,149
Thermodynamically, it
is unstable. All right?

816
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:13,060
Um, Yeah, so that's
kind of neat.

817
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,299
But the other two
parts, A to B,

818
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,539
and C to D aren't
they're stable.

819
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:19,539
That's allowed, right?

820
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:20,899
That still follows
what we said.

821
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,299
And so what makes
this kind of

822
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:24,179
neat is that with this
kind of procedure

823
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,459
with Vandervals
defining point B

824
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,620
and point C for
substances,

825
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,019
you can produce
regions of what

826
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,739
we would call
metatability, okay?

827
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:35,139
And again,
you're not going

828
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,259
to be on an examine stuff,

829
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:37,140
but some things you should

830
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,179
just know, like water,

831
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:39,459
for example,
does not freeze

832
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,779
at 0 Celsius, right?

833
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:41,860
If I wanted to freeze,

834
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,250
you need to cool
it much below.

835
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,159
Much below zero, okay?

836
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:46,399
So when you have
liquid water,

837
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,440
that's a liquid water
below 0 Celsius,

838
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,079
that's a meta stable
liquid, right?

839
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,079
If anyone watches, like,

840
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,439
the Buffalo
Bills, you know,

841
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,600
play football, it's

842
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,920
like actually,
they're good now.

843
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,479
They're very good. But
for a long time, not.

844
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,839
But the point is,
you'll see like

845
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,840
sometimes there's
these videos

846
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,600
in like the fridge,

847
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,839
and they'll take a
water bottle out of

848
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,740
a fridge at a game.
It's like hilarious.

849
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,479
Fridge in a place
where it's like,

850
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:08,000
minus, you know, whatever
degrees Celsius.

851
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,240
They'll take the
water out and

852
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,320
then they'll
like flick it.

853
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,280
And then all of a sudden,

854
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,240
you see, like
solidification.

855
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,040
Like, suddenly that
otling it caused

856
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,920
it to freeze and that's
a metastable flu.

857
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,239
It's like beautiful tube.

858
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,440
You want to come
my lab I'll show

859
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,599
you some wacky stuff.

860
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,200
But that's a
metastable fluid.

861
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,160
It's the same
when you boil.

862
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,720
If you boil
something, it doesn't

863
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,399
happen at 100
degrees C here.

864
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,159
You need to push
way beyond that.

865
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:27,720
You have to make

866
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,320
the surface much
hotter in order to

867
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,999
get the liquid to

868
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,440
transition into
being a vapor.

869
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,039
And the same also
in condensation.

870
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,359
It doesn't happen
at the dew point.

871
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,079
You usually got to
cool it below, there.

872
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:39,719
And anyways,

873
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,640
the take home message

874
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
out of this is
that this kind of

875
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,519
pretty smart young guy in

876
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,720
his graduate studies,

877
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,319
not too much older
than you, you know,

878
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,519
went in and wrote
this kind of

879
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,079
seemingly simple
formula that

880
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,840
produced this kind of,

881
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,800
you know, results,
this insight,

882
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,319
which to this day
we look into.

883
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,080
So in my lab,

884
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,199
we look into a lot
of what we call

885
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,679
these metastable
transitions.

886
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,800
When does water boil?

887
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,519
When does it condense?
How does it freeze?

888
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,959
I'm going to
talk like we got

889
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,960
Boeing executives below
us at the moment.

890
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,080
So in like 30 minutes,

891
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,440
I'm going to go
talk to them about

892
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,039
some of the problems
and icing that

893
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,199
we have that are you
know, that exists there.

894
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,079
But it's kind of like,
you know, A, B, C,

895
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,479
D, it's kind of it's
kind of neat, okay?

896
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:19,999
And again, all
from young man

897
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:22,479
doing grad school
with it, okay?

898
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,639
It's also interesting to

899
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:24,600
look at the ideal gas.

900
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,759
So, you know, again, we
had property tables,

901
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,679
we had Vandervals you

902
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:31,119
can also put on

903
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,679
the same plot on
the ideal gas.

904
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,759
And from this, you'll see,

905
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,254
again, so very, um,

906
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:38,549
low densities out here,
very low pressures.

907
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:39,949
Everything aligns, okay?

908
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:42,749
So that's all valid.
But who cares?

909
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:44,270
I mean, like, who cares?

910
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,829
Like, that's not where a

911
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:46,949
lot of the action
happens, right?

912
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:47,710
A lot of the action

913
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,869
happens over when
you get here.

914
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:49,670
And at this point,

915
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,069
you see a strong
divergence of

916
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:53,030
the ideal gas equation

917
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,039
from the other
two cases, okay?

918
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,329
Great. What I want to

919
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,489
wrap up with here and
let's see if I have,

920
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:01,689
you know, the amount
of time for it.

921
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,369
Otherwise, I can
continue next week

922
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:05,370
is this business

923
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,369
into these constants so

924
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:09,689
these specific
heats, right?

925
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:11,689
So in that problem
we did before,

926
00:31:11,689 --> 00:31:14,330
right, we took
basically a container.

927
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,210
We defined a mass.

928
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,009
We transferred
some heat into it,

929
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:21,049
and we wanted to know what

930
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,170
was the change
in temperature.

931
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,450
We knew the change
in temperature,

932
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,050
and we wanted to know

933
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,290
how much heat
that we put in.

934
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,050
We did a conservation
of energy.

935
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,130
We said the
change in energy

936
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,249
of this control volume is

937
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:31,690
equal to how much enters

938
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,729
minus how much is out.

939
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:35,250
These are little E, so
this is like per mass.

940
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,849
Um Right,

941
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:38,089
this system is kept at

942
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:39,170
constant volume, right?

943
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,329
So the change in
the energy of

944
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,209
the system is nothing
but the change in,

945
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:45,370
um, uh, the
internal energy.

946
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,409
The E and then the E
out of this are only

947
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:49,529
going to be heat
transfer processes.

948
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:50,330
And so what you're

949
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,250
going to end up
with is that

950
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,369
that heat in is this
constant times dt.

951
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,169
And we'll call
this a CV, right?

952
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:56,449
So it's constant volume,

953
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:58,529
we'll say C,
little V times dt,

954
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,170
and then that's going
to be equal to d,

955
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:05,049
um, to little D,
you know, little U.

956
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,450
And then, by definition,

957
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,730
so the definition then of

958
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,889
the specific heat at
constant volume, right,

959
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:11,249
is the partial
derivative of

960
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:13,169
the internal energy
of your control,

961
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:15,410
you know, of the
system with respect

962
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,809
to temperature for
constant volume.

963
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:19,609
We're going to
use this like

964
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:21,449
a ton, like a ton, okay?

965
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:23,529
So like this,
Oh, it doesn't.

966
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:24,649
We're going to use
it a lot, okay,

967
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:25,849
especially with
the engines

968
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:28,299
and and fun
stuff like that.

969
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:29,859
So this is kind
of like let's

970
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:31,219
call it factual, okay?

971
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:33,459
Factual, right? And we

972
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:34,819
do the same heat
addition process,

973
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,140
but not constant volume,

974
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,459
we have constant pressure.

975
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:38,699
You expect there,
there's going

976
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,059
to be not just
the warming,

977
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,419
but potentially
work, right?

978
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,179
I have a P Delta
V. So what

979
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:44,179
you're going to
expect is that

980
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,340
that value should
be higher, right?

981
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,819
Because when I
transfer some heat in,

982
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:48,620
I'm going to do
some work at

983
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,379
the same time that
I'm heating, right?

984
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:52,929
Um, We'll get into,

985
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,049
like, what this term
means as a little H,

986
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,610
but essentially
its definition

987
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,370
is the partial
derivative of enthalpy,

988
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,249
essentially kind
of energy with

989
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:02,649
respect to temperature
for constant pressure,

990
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,729
and we're also
going to use that

991
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:05,489
one a ton, okay?

992
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:08,289
Their units are
energy per mass per

993
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,530
keelvin or energy energy
per mass per degree.

994
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,250
So it could be degree
Kelvin degrees Celsius.

995
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,569
It doesn't
matter. A lot of

996
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:16,650
times, actually,
all the times,

997
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,290
it's going to be
a Delta T. We're

998
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:18,889
always going to be working

999
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:20,129
with differences
in temperature.

1000
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:21,850
So it can be differences
in temperature,

1001
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,609
Kelvin temperatures
and temperature,

1002
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:24,770
Celsius, as long as you're

1003
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,089
consistent, you're
good, okay?

1004
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,289
But again, it's like heat.

1005
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:28,449
Because I put heat in, I

1006
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:29,809
expect the temperature
change, right?

1007
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,569
And the constant
in front of it is

1008
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:34,849
the specific heat, okay?

1009
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:37,450
And so, coming back
to Jules experiment,

1010
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,729
right, he was
basically very,

1011
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:40,090
you know, very
concerned with

1012
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,409
how this thing here.

1013
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:45,769
So basically calculating,
especially CV here.

1014
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:46,849
So if I kept things at

1015
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:48,889
constant volume and
I made changes,

1016
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:50,449
you know, will I actually

1017
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:53,369
measure a change in
temperature, okay?

1018
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,649
And it turns out,
I'm going to

1019
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:56,050
foreshadow. We'll
get into it.

1020
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,849
But for an ideal
gas, um, You know,

1021
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:00,369
this internal
energy, you know,

1022
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:03,369
is only dependent upon
temperature there,

1023
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:03,610
right?

1024
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,850
So when you get to the CV,

1025
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,609
it only depends on that.

1026
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:07,409
It doesn't depend on
temperature or it depend

1027
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,569
on pressure or
volume, okay?

1028
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:10,529
With 4 seconds ago,

1029
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:11,369
I'm going to
close it there.

1030
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:12,329
If you have questions
I'm up here.

1031
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:13,770
Otherwise, I got
to run downstairs.

1032
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,609
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

1033
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:19,049
Thank you.
