1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,240
All right, I got 210.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,880
So I'm going to
get started.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,400
Today, we're going
to continue with

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,320
mass and energy analysis

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,880
to control volumes, okay?

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,280
So after today, you

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,720
should be able
to start solving

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,359
some of these energy
balance problems

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,639
for steady flow devices.

10
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:18,720
So the problems
basically in

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,759
Homework five there, okay?

12
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:27,900
Um Last lecture, we
derived flow work, right?

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,459
We talk about
flow work there,

14
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,099
just to remind you
what that was, right?

15
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,899
Imagine we have a
control volume,

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,779
defined here by the
dashed red line.

17
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:39,259
Let's say we have a
single inlet and we

18
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:41,539
have a single
outlet there.

19
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,260
At this inlet, let's

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,219
say we have some
specific volume,

21
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,829
a pressure, And we
can imagine then a

22
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,269
fictitious or an
imaginary piston, okay?

23
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:53,189
So we kind of, like,

24
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:56,469
push push this
in some amount.

25
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,389
That is an area and a move

26
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,029
a distance, that's
displacement, right?

27
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,389
And if there's a
pressure there,

28
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:03,269
there's a work associated
with that, okay?

29
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:04,790
What's the take
home message?

30
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,949
The take home message is

31
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:07,670
that sometimes it requires

32
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,469
work to bring a fluid
into a device, right?

33
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,349
Or alternatively,
maybe there's work

34
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,749
transferred out
from it, right?

35
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:17,189
And if we do our kind of

36
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,709
traditional energy
analysis where

37
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,829
we just talk about W,

38
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,829
that total W is going to

39
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,829
have that in
it, all right?

40
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,669
And so what we did
is we took out

41
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,109
the flow work from
the total work,

42
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,309
and we got, you know,

43
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:33,149
useful work and flow work,

44
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:34,989
and we basically
merged that flow work

45
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,509
with internal energy to

46
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,249
form what property?
Phenthropy.

47
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,729
Yes. I can go home.

48
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,490
I don't need to be
here today. Cool.

49
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,809
Yes, so we had
this, right?

50
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,329
And so what was
the way that

51
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:52,809
these fluids could
carry in energy, right?

52
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:55,690
Right? It can possess
internal energy,

53
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,530
it can possess
kinetic energy,

54
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,810
and it can possess
potential energy,

55
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,759
um, there, okay?

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,279
And we write that as like

57
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:06,639
little E. Just
to remind you,

58
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,800
this, you know, beautiful
equation, right?

59
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,560
The conservation of
energy written in

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,400
rate format where we

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
work with specific
enthalpy, right?

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
So we can write the
rate of change of

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
energy in the control
volume is the net heat

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,800
transferred in minus

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,520
the net useful work
transferred out.

66
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,040
M dot, right in

67
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,159
the enthalpy kinetic
energy potential,

68
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,120
that's in and then
basically out, right?

69
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,680
But the point is
that because we have

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,120
enthalpy internal
energy plus

71
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,160
pressure times
specific volume,

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,724
this is the useful.

73
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,010
On the other hand,
in this summation,

74
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,769
you go with
internal energy,

75
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:44,410
this is going to
be overall work.

76
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,410
And an example that
we did last week,

77
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,010
if you do the
overall work,

78
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,769
you're going to have
an answer that's off

79
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,010
by about like
20% there, okay?

80
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,409
So really with
steady flow devices,

81
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,490
so when you can bring
mass in and out

82
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,730
of the device, you know,

83
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,490
we're going to be working

84
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,290
with enthalpy only with

85
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,290
enthalpy changes
to figure out if

86
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,570
heats transferred is work

87
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,850
transferred and so on
and so forth, right?

88
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,490
Okay, and that's
what we'll work

89
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,810
on today. I'll
show that to you.

90
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,850
Um, Yes, right?

91
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,569
And so when we
talk about steady,

92
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:18,329
so when we talk about

93
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,569
steady in these processes,

94
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,450
steady didn't
mean, you know,

95
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,249
so when I talked
about steady here,

96
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:26,290
we were saying, I have
some control volume.

97
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,530
The change in the mass in

98
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,730
the control volume
as a function

99
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,810
of time was equal to m.in,

100
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,050
you know, minus, you know,

101
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,650
M dot out, right?

102
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:45,539
This is dm in dt minus
dm out. Right, dt.

103
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,579
And when we talked
about steady,

104
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,580
we don't mean that

105
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,019
all of these
terms are zero.

106
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,580
What we mean is that

107
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,740
this term goes
to zero, right?

108
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,100
So what does this imply?

109
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,419
DM in dt is equal to
dm out dt, right?

110
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,300
So I don't know,

111
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,500
the amount of mass then in

112
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,100
the control volume
does not change.

113
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,980
It's constant. And
the same applies

114
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,979
then for conservation
of energy.

115
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,980
So our conservation of

116
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,380
energy would then
be the rate of

117
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,040
change of energy in

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,439
the control volume, right?

119
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:23,839
Dt is equal to e.in
minus E dot out.

120
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,559
When it's steady, right,

121
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,119
this is zero, right?

122
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:31,239
And so then
basically D E in

123
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:37,689
dt is equal to
d out DT, okay?

124
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,529
And I think all

125
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,930
the examples I'm
going to work

126
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,169
on for the next couple

127
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:44,890
of lectures are going
to be for this.

128
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,489
I'll have one example
where I can show

129
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:48,450
you a process
that's unsteady,

130
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,089
and actually,

131
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,489
it's a problem
from some of the

132
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:53,409
research that we do, okay?

133
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,729
This case here
is one inlet in,

134
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,449
one inlet outlet or one
inlet and one outlet.

135
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,609
But you can also have
cases where you have

136
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:03,649
one inlet and two
outlets here, right?

137
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,890
One example of that is,

138
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,730
Sometimes you want to
separate like a stream.

139
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,650
You can have a stream

140
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,689
that's like a mixture of,

141
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,289
like, liquid and vapor.

142
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,049
Something like this
could be a separator.

143
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,369
Only vapor goes through
and then liquid,

144
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,089
you know, comes out
the bottom, right?

145
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,049
So that's a common thing.

146
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:20,969
But the point is that

147
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:22,289
it's still
conserved, right?

148
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,490
I could say, you
know, that's

149
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,929
still satisfied
in the sense of,

150
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:28,249
right, the m.in is
equal to the M dot out.

151
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:31,769
It's just that M
dot two plus M

152
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,129
dot three is going
to be equal to

153
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:36,409
M dot one there, okay?

154
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:41,329
Questions? This is
all very clear.

155
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,329
Cool. All right.

156
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,880
I forgot my water
today, so devastating.

157
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,359
Alright. So examples of
some devices, right?

158
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,399
So turbines, basically
how we still

159
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,519
produce most of our
power, propulsion.

160
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,160
So you think
about nozzles,

161
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,879
heat exchangers, you know,

162
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,560
compressors, and so
on and so forth.

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,200
These are all steady flow,

164
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,439
right, steady flow
devices, okay?

165
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,399
Just for

166
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,880
some terminologies,
for some notation.

167
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,159
So when we were where
to begin with this?

168
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:22,849
Um, Right?

169
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,489
So when we were
talking about our,

170
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:26,689
you know, conservation
of energy, right?

171
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,049
So if we think about
like our piston,

172
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,169
it's instructive I think

173
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,370
to think about
the piston here.

174
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,609
So the mass in this case,

175
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,649
right, with the
piston was equal to

176
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,210
a constant. So
that didn't vary.

177
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,129
The way that we wrote

178
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,130
the energy equation here,

179
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,449
right, was Delta E,

180
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:45,049
CV is equal to E
in minus E out.

181
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:47,170
The way that energy
can change here is

182
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,089
we can have Delta U plus

183
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:54,419
Delta E plus
Delta P, right?

184
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,059
And then this is

185
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:56,219
equal to the
ways that we can

186
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:58,179
transfer energy in
and out, right?

187
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:02,499
So this could be
Q in plus W in

188
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:08,219
minus Q out plus
W out, right?

189
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:13,419
Okay. I'll put
this to the side.

190
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:15,859
Now, what side should
I put this to?

191
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:17,580
All right. Maybe I'll

192
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,820
put this here and
bring this back.

193
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,409
Oh, okay.

194
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,689
So in the case of the,

195
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,409
um, you know, energy
transport by mass,

196
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:40,849
so we can, you
know, again, write,

197
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,290
uh, we have

198
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,369
two conservation
equations now, right?

199
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:48,729
So dm CV dt is equal

200
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,529
to what I would call.in
minus m dot out,

201
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,049
and then we have
our energy, right?

202
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:59,210
So d CV dt is equal to

203
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:05,809
e.in minus E dot
out. All right.

204
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:10,329
Um, Let's focus on

205
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:11,649
the right hand
side for a second.

206
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:12,529
So we think about

207
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,849
the way that we can
bring it in, right?

208
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:16,289
We still have our Q in.

209
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,609
We call it Q dot because
it's a rate, right?

210
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:21,610
We can still have w.in.

211
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,289
And now we have
the flow, right?

212
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,009
So here on this side,

213
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,409
we only had heat and work,

214
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:27,369
but now we can bring

215
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:30,050
in energy associated
with flow.

216
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,849
And then that's going
to be let's call

217
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,209
it dot I or.in.

218
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:39,009
And that'll be times,

219
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,430
the, uh, you know,

220
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,630
U plus PV, right,

221
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,629
plus velocity
squared divided

222
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:55,430
by two plus GZ, right?

223
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,189
And then this
is all applying

224
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,550
to the in case, right?

225
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,830
And then plus a

226
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,790
negative associated
with the out, right?

227
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:10,480
So Q dot out
plus w dot out,

228
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,319
plus dot, what should
we call it here?

229
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:18,240
We can call it M
dot O for out,

230
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
U plus PV plus W

231
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,040
squared divided
by two plus G Z.

232
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,360
And again, we
can call this as

233
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,760
like an out term.

234
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,679
So it's instructive
to basically

235
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,320
compare the right hand
sides that you have

236
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,400
here with the heat in the

237
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,840
work with here where you

238
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,079
have the rate versions

239
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,679
of heat and work transfer,

240
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,640
and then plus the
flow work term, okay?

241
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,000
Because I have the
PV written here,

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,159
what does this mean
about the work terms?

243
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,400
Go ahead, okay.

244
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,680
Second. Do you want
something else?

245
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,240
That's the
question I asked.

246
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,200
GZ, what do you think
GZ is G is what?

247
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,760
Not a wrapper.
Okay. So it's

248
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,560
gravity and then
what's Z? Or Z.

249
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,440
Yeah, height.

250
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,239
So basically it's
potential energy?

251
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,519
It's potential energy.

252
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,040
W right here I'm
writing is velocity,

253
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,239
it's kinetic energy

254
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,720
as we derived
it last time.

255
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,200
PV pressure is
pressure via

256
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,599
specific volume and U
is internal energy.

257
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,920
So what type of

258
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,359
work is this then for
a steady flow device?

259
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,079
I think I heard it,
right, hallucinated.

260
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,720
Shaft Shaft work,

261
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,959
right? This is
useful work here.

262
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,800
And it's a useful
work term, right?

263
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
And this U plus PV,

264
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,560
right is then internal
energy, okay?

265
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,200
And the point is, if
you read the book and

266
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,080
you look at it,
this U, right?

267
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,720
So basically,

268
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,239
maybe I'll do the
top one like this.

269
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,960
Now I can do it with
red. All right.

270
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,600
So if you see it in
the book, right,

271
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,479
you're going to see, um,

272
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,979
But essentially,

273
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,259
this term that
I've highlighted

274
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:08,460
here is what they define
as being little E,

275
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,460
right? Little E, okay?

276
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,299
So it's like internal
energy, kinetic energy,

277
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,820
potential energy on a
per mass basis, right?

278
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,980
That's essentially
what the

279
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,300
little literally is.

280
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,620
If you add to this also
the PV term, right?

281
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,139
So again, maybe I'll
take the Oca here,

282
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,420
then this is going to
be equal to what they

283
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,580
write as Theta, right?

284
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,740
So Theta is then little
E plus PV, okay?

285
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,980
Again, this is just to
make life easier in

286
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,660
terms of the math

287
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,299
because it can
get exhausting.

288
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,460
Um, You know, it can
get exhausting to

289
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,180
write that a bunch
of times, okay?

290
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,940
And then on the
left hand side,

291
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,220
you can still have the
same things, right?

292
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,780
So you can have, you know,

293
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,299
you can still have
internal energy,

294
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,220
the kinetic energy and
the potential energy

295
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,819
that's that's
stored there.

296
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:02,980
And we'll get into this
analysis next week.

297
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,580
So we'll get into how to

298
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,020
deal with the unsteady
case on Monday, okay?

299
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,220
Informational.

300
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,740
Okay. Yeah, so the
second important thing,

301
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,020
there was a student
who had raised this

302
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,420
to me before that you
can have cases, right?

303
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,660
So when we did, maybe it's

304
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,740
instructive to
come back to here.

305
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
So how do we write
the work term here?

306
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,140
So when we talk about
boundary work term,

307
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,739
what's the, let me

308
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:35,899
write it another way,
I can write basically.

309
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,740
So when we talk
about boundary work,

310
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,980
how do we write
it for like a

311
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,639
piston expansion
or compression?

312
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,900
PDV, right?

313
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,580
So you have PDV
like that, right?

314
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,899
Okay. In these processes,

315
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,219
so you think
like a turbine.

316
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:53,020
A turbine produces
a ton of work,

317
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,899
but it doesn't
change volume.

318
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,620
It doesn't change
volume. Okay?

319
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,900
How would you write
that work term?

320
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Okay, let's think,
like, to the basics.

321
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,020
So what makes a fan blow?

322
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,779
Never had one of
those as a kid,

323
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,060
like the spinning wheel?

324
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,820
What do they call those?

325
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,660
The Oh, my God,
my brain today.

326
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,060
Pin wheel things,
right? You blow.

327
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,340
Okay? So what
does that mean?

328
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,799
Tanential but simpler.

329
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm a kindergartener,
you know?

330
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,199
Yes. Okay. And
then a fluid,

331
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:43,679
how do we call

332
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,039
those constant
kinds of forces?

333
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,560
A steady flow or a
pressure, right?

334
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,040
Basically, I have
a higher pressure

335
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,120
in front of it than
I do behind it.

336
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,040
So I have a Delta P. And

337
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm telling you that

338
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,960
the volume doesn't change.

339
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,000
So how would you write
work in that case?

340
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,670
It's dimensionally
the same, guys.

341
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,110
It's Friday, so

342
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,310
I'll give it to
you, all right?

343
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,790
But you can get
into, right?

344
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,270
You can have basically
a V and a DP, right?

345
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,830
So if I keep
that, you know,

346
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,429
if I basically
have the specific

347
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,670
volume that I know,

348
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,230
and it's a constant
volume there,

349
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,429
it's steady flow, so the
mass doesn't change.

350
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:29,789
So the volume is constant.

351
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:30,870
The mass doesn't change.

352
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,550
Specific volume is
the same, right?

353
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,310
So that means
that's a constant.

354
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,000
I right?

355
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
And so write this little W

356
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,680
just to, you know,
keep it like that.

357
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,080
Basically, it's a VDP.

358
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,599
You end up basically
with a VDP.

359
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,599
So it's PDV when
it's expansion.

360
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,960
And then when it's a
device like, you know,

361
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,639
our pinwheel there,
you'll end up with a VDP.

362
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,560
I think I saw a hand
raised on this side.

363
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,239
Yes, please.

364
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,370
Yeah, so energy,
unfortunately, is confusing.

365
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,970
Feinman, when he
used to teach,

366
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,610
said, like,
entropy was easy.

367
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,849
You're going to
learn entropy.

368
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:12,890
Not today, okay?

369
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,370
But energy was
hard because

370
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,690
there's all kinds of
forms of it, right?

371
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,010
So what you need to
do is you need to

372
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,129
start to classify,
right, in your mind.

373
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,010
So this is a boundary
work, right?

374
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,450
It's an expansion process.

375
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,970
You can call it
whatever you want.

376
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,289
Feinman was also
a fan of that.

377
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:28,450
Have it this name
and that name and

378
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,810
that it doesn't
matter, right?

379
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,529
This ps and expanding

380
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,570
is going to be a PDV term,

381
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,049
okay? We had other
kinds of work.

382
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:38,810
What's another way that
we had work transfer?

383
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,930
Remember this?
Electrical, right?

384
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,570
We have electrons
that can flow

385
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,970
in and transfer work
into the system, right?

386
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,330
I have a voltage and
I have a current.

387
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,010
The electrons flow in.

388
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,690
They kind of heat up
that resistor there,

389
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,970
and that energy is

390
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,009
transferred into
the control volume.

391
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,490
That's electrical
work, right?

392
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,010
So you have kind of a
W electrical there,

393
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,770
okay?

394
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,130
We had flow work,
you know, right?

395
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,450
So when we had this
open system and we

396
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,649
tried to bring the fluid

397
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,210
in, it was kind
of flow work.

398
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,050
It resembles, in a sense,

399
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,299
something like,
um, PDV here.

400
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:17,500
Actually, it was the
same, right? It's a PDV.

401
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,820
It's just that
in this case,

402
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,699
there's no real piston.

403
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,300
It's just like
this is the work

404
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,780
necessary to
actually bring

405
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,580
you into the system, okay?

406
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,500
So that was a flow you

407
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,860
know, a flow work term.

408
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,380
And then the
final one that

409
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,740
we've talked about so far,

410
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,500
I believe, is then
shaft work, okay?

411
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,140
So I would say boundary,
electrical, flow,

412
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,780
and shaft work are

413
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,940
probably most of the forms

414
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,460
of work that we'll deal
with in this class.

415
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,295
It's a good question.
Other questions?

416
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:53,210
Building on these.

417
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,210
Now, just the
front row today.

418
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,610
Cool. All right. Yeah, so

419
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,610
you can produce
work, right?

420
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,410
Remember before when we
had this case and it

421
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,329
was kept at constant
volume, right?

422
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,569
No work transfer
possible here.

423
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,530
However, when you if you

424
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,329
allow a fluid to
flow in, all right?

425
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,089
Again, just like your
pinwheel example,

426
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,929
if you allow a
fluid to flow in,

427
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,289
you can keep
your system at

428
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,889
constant volume and
produce work, all right?

429
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,170
And that has to
do with the fact

430
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,609
that there's a pressure
difference, right?

431
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,369
Basically, that
pressure difference

432
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,769
across the device
that's making it spin.

433
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:28,170
No different than
a wind turbine

434
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,049
and that, okay?

435
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,880
Yes, blah, blah, blah.

436
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,479
Yeah. And again, in order

437
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,759
to make this
the shaft work,

438
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,960
right, we need to separate

439
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,520
out the flow work, right?

440
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,640
Basically, we
got to take PV,

441
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,399
you know, out of out
of the work term,

442
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,719
bring it here,
and then write it

443
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:55,039
essentially in this
format, all right?

444
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,479
Cool. So with that,

445
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm going to now actually
do some examples

446
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,679
because I feel like

447
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,839
it's a lot of
math and talking.

448
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,839
So I want to go through

449
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,399
and analyze this problem.

450
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,799
And then once we've
done that, I want

451
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,280
to throw it to you guys to

452
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,560
go through and
try to clarify

453
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,439
any misunderstandings
we have, all right?

454
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:14,679
Great. Have you been

455
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:16,039
recording? Yeah,
I have been.

456
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:22,289
All right. I'm probably

457
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:23,649
going to regret
erasing that.

458
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:26,769
Sorry. All right. That do.

459
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:30,529
This can go here.
This can go here.

460
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,649
All right,

461
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,210
so what do we have
in this example?

462
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,169
In this example,
we're looking

463
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:42,010
at analyzing a compressor.

464
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,889
Okay. So how does
the compressor work?

465
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,209
Compressor works by

466
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,290
taking we have
shaft works.

467
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,810
We have, like, a motor
that's spinning,

468
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,810
and it draws air in
or a gas in that's

469
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,620
at a higher a
specific volume

470
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,099
and compresses it, right?

471
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:01,299
So expectations out of

472
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,499
this device is that
at the end of this,

473
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:06,619
the pressure will
be basically

474
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:08,460
the pressure will be
higher. That's the goal.

475
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,579
It's basically the goal of

476
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:13,944
your of your
compressor. Okay?

477
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,989
Great.

478
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:16,469
And for those who want
to follow on, we can,

479
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,909
what I'm going to
assume is that we have

480
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:20,110
ideal gas
properties of air,

481
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,550
and here we're
going to neglect

482
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,110
kinetic and potential
energy changes.

483
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,470
As I mentioned
before, there will be

484
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,429
devices when we start
to care about this.

485
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:27,269
The one that's most

486
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,549
important is the
nozzle, right?

487
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,189
The nozzle that I
mentioned before, okay?

488
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:34,629
So like anything
else, at this point,

489
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:36,429
I'm just going to do
things with, like,

490
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:38,030
painfully detailed

491
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,230
and show you my
assumptions,

492
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,469
and as time goes on,

493
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:41,989
I'll skip through
those, right?

494
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:43,789
So we have two
conservation equations.

495
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:44,589
So the first is

496
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:45,989
our conservation
of mass, right?

497
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:48,830
So DM, CV, dt

498
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,429
or the control volume is

499
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,519
drawn here with our
dashed red line.

500
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:58,889
Is equal to m.in
minus m dot out.

501
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:00,970
We're going to
assume steady,

502
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,609
so we're going to

503
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,050
assume steady
operating conditions.

504
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,529
So what this
implies is that

505
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:08,649
dot N is equal
to m dot out,

506
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:10,689
which I'm usually
just going to write

507
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:13,449
as dot, okay, dot.

508
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:15,289
Now conservation
of energy, right,

509
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:19,649
DE CV dt so the change
in the energy in

510
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:21,610
the control volume
is equal to

511
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,369
e.in minus E dot out.

512
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:27,769
Again, we're going to

513
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,170
assume steady conditions.

514
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:36,159
So e.in is equal to
e dot out, right?

515
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,359
We can we can

516
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,080
separate this into its
different components.

517
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,319
So for the e.in, right,

518
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:51,399
I can have w.in plus
q.in plus dot, right?

519
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:52,599
So it will be m.in,

520
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,799
but I'm just writing
it as M dot.

521
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,719
I'm going to
write then H one.

522
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,199
So we're state one.

523
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,639
State one is defined here.

524
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,280
So I'm defining
this enthalpy

525
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,909
at state one here.

526
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:09,220
Plus velocity one squared

527
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,499
divided by two
plus G Z one,

528
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:13,899
where G is the
acceleration

529
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,620
constant due to gravity,

530
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,139
and Z one is then
position, okay?

531
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:19,260
And then this is equal

532
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,179
to exactly the same thing

533
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,820
here that I'm going
to write except

534
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,659
it's going to be out
and the number two.

535
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,939
So then what I
have here is W dot

536
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:32,099
out plus Q dot out plus M

537
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,819
dot times H two plus

538
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,739
W two squared divided
by two plus g z two.

539
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:43,219
What can we get rid of?

540
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,289
Name? Arturo.
So Connecticut

541
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,329
and Potential are out.

542
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,009
What else on this
side of the room?

543
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:00,689
You have a brave soul
in the back there?

544
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:05,560
No. Okay. Yes,
please, Maya?

545
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,269
Qn.

546
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:08,429
Q. Yeah, because we
don't have a Q in,

547
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:10,909
so Qn is out.

548
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:11,749
What else?

549
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:15,830
K workout, workout
is also not there.

550
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,709
Work in has to

551
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,109
remain because that's
the whole point, right?

552
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:19,869
We have some work
we're transferring in,

553
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:20,949
and that's ultimately what

554
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:22,229
we want to determine.

555
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:24,469
The dot is a given.

556
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:28,110
H one will determine
from properties.

557
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,390
Q dot out on a per
mass basis is given,

558
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,229
so I can redefine that.

559
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:39,429
The Q dot out here

560
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:42,589
is let me think
about this.

561
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:46,599
So Q dot out is

562
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,959
equal to m dot
times little Q out.

563
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,159
This is like a
definition, Q out

564
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,399
here is kilojoules
per kilogram,

565
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,600
mass fluorid is
kilogram per second.

566
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,039
So I multiply those

567
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,359
together kilowatts, right?

568
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,679
So what this means
is that we can

569
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,159
just write we can

570
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,839
substitute into this
term dot times Q out.

571
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,760
So both of those
things are known.

572
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,240
The dot is known,

573
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,799
and the tube will know

574
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,559
from from
properties, okay?

575
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,729
Cool. So we can
simplify this.

576
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:28,129
Let me just simplify
it. So what do we have?

577
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:37,489
We have w.in, is equal
to our M dot Q out.

578
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:38,889
What's on our
left hand side,

579
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:44,489
two plus dot times
that's H two, right?

580
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,889
And then this will be
subtracted by one.

581
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:51,049
And why does this
make sense, right?

582
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,209
Why does this
arrangement make sense?

583
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,009
So this arrangement
makes sense

584
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:01,205
because if I transfer
work in the system,

585
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:04,519
Uh, I would
expect, and again,

586
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,280
because I've written
this in notation,

587
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,999
this is going to be a
positive value, right?

588
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,560
This is positive values.

589
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,960
My expectation is
that the enthalpy

590
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,479
at the exit will

591
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,079
be higher than
the inlet, right?

592
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,480
Because I'm
putting work in.

593
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,959
If I'm going to
put energy in,

594
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,599
I would expect
that the thing

595
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,640
that also means
kind of energy,

596
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,119
you know, should basically

597
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,479
be larger than that.

598
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,960
If this wasn't the
case, if it was less,

599
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,319
then this would end up if

600
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,519
we forgot that
for a second,

601
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,999
if this was less
than H one,

602
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:32,400
then the work in would be

603
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,924
negative, which
means what?

604
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,009
Work out, right? Okay.

605
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,810
Because remember, when
I write ins and outs,

606
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,289
I'm not doing anything
with signs, right?

607
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:41,889
So if I write
in, I'm going to

608
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:42,969
stick with the magnitude

609
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:44,489
for that term, all right?

610
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:47,569
Super. All right.

611
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,049
So let's see
how I did it in

612
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:53,459
my um Notes
here that I do.

613
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,979
Yeah. Okay, so for
H two and H one,

614
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:58,579
we can do this two
different ways to start.

615
00:24:58,579 --> 00:24:59,659
So for H two,

616
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:01,219
let's focus on
this for a second,

617
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:02,180
because we need to

618
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,419
know this is a
question mark,

619
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,739
and this is a question
mark, this we got,

620
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,619
this we got, this
we got, okay?

621
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:11,699
So for H two, all right,

622
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:13,459
we can focus on State two.

623
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,179
So at state two,
we know that P

624
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,455
two is equal to 600.

625
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:22,689
KPa, and we know
that T two is

626
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:27,329
equal to 500
Kelvin, right.

627
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,249
What this means
is if you went to

628
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:30,489
property tables or Pi

629
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,449
Kilo or whatever
and did it,

630
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,809
you have complete
information here, right?

631
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:37,409
So you'll be able
to determine H two,

632
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,409
V two, V two, right?

633
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:39,689
Like,

634
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:42,409
all these things you
could know from this.

635
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:44,809
We care at the
moment about H two.

636
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,929
The same for
state one, okay?

637
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:52,199
For state one, P one
is equal to 100 kPa.

638
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:59,870
All right. And T one is
equal to 290 kelvin.

639
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,869
It's the same
thing, right?

640
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:02,629
You'll be able
to know H one,

641
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:06,629
U one, and V
one from that.

642
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,109
For the purposes
of this problem,

643
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:12,269
we only care about
H one, okay?

644
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,429
Great. Yeah, so if

645
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:19,070
you go in and
you substitute

646
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,349
values for these things,

647
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,429
so we know, right,

648
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:25,659
the M dot So the
M dot there,

649
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:30,100
we have a 0.02
kilogram/second.

650
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,259
The Q out, we have as

651
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:38,220
one kilojoule
per kilogram.

652
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,539
If you substitute in,

653
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,420
you know, you click on

654
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,459
the notebook
and go through,

655
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,179
but substitute in
the values from H

656
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:45,339
one and H two,
that you'd have.

657
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:50,699
What I end up with
as my w.in in

658
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:57,300
watts is 4278 watts,

659
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:04,379
which is equal to
4.278 kilowatts, okay?

660
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:07,139
So this is one way
to do it, alright?

661
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,979
Maybe I will
move it to this.

662
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:11,219
What's the best
thing to do?

663
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:12,259
No, I'll keep this here,

664
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,259
and I'll move to
the left hand side.

665
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,739
What's another way
that we could do

666
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:18,460
this that might
seem easier?

667
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,579
I mean, I think this
is pretty easy.

668
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,259
I like this.

669
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:25,579
But what's another
way that I taught

670
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:29,899
you changes an enthalpy
for an ideal gas?

671
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,719
Okay.

672
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,520
So if I transfer

673
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,159
heat into something,
what changes?

674
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,480
The temperature.
Okay? All right?

675
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,359
When we did a
closed system

676
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,920
at constant volume,

677
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,800
and I transferred
some heat

678
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,880
into that, what
was that equal to?

679
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,400
So constant volume,
closed system.

680
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,369
Okay, right?
So we had Q is

681
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:15,369
CV, Delta T, right?

682
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,609
So Q is CV Delta T, right?

683
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,129
What I showed you
is because this is

684
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:21,170
isochoric for a
closed system,

685
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,609
there's no boundary
work, right?

686
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,009
And from the first law, if

687
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,570
I don't have any
work transfer,

688
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,129
d is going to be
equal to Q, right?

689
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:31,969
So then what we
could say, right,

690
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:35,289
was that CV was
equal to, um,

691
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:39,629
right, d, Oh, sorry.

692
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:42,510
Yeah, basically du dt

693
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,949
for constant V.
The point was

694
00:28:44,949 --> 00:28:49,390
that changes in
temperature times CV

695
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,550
would give you changes
in internal energy.

696
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,509
All right? Does
anyone remember

697
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:57,430
an analogous formula
for enthalpy?

698
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,710
Louder.

699
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,789
Name high, and high,
and then a name.

700
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:15,349
Yes, please. Name? A Yes.

701
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,000
Or constant pressure.

702
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,120
And that's it,
right? So changes

703
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,560
in enthalpy can be

704
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,599
related to changes in

705
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,279
temperature by CP, okay?

706
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,999
All right.

707
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:35,559
And then for an
ideal gas, right,

708
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,919
the internal energy only

709
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:38,759
depends on temperature.

710
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,359
So the point is that for
a problem like this,

711
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:43,159
what you could do
is we could write H

712
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:49,479
two minus H one
as being equal

713
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:56,919
to Cp times T two
minus T one, right?

714
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,759
It's possible, okay?

715
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,239
So this is another
way to do it.

716
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:06,039
It's less precise than

717
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,280
looking up right exact

718
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,159
properties in this way.

719
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:11,279
But over the
temperature range

720
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:11,840
that we have here,

721
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,160
so 290 to 500,

722
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,679
probably taking a value
of specific heat at

723
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:20,880
room temperature
and multiplying

724
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,760
it by the Delta T
would get you within,

725
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,119
like, you know,
a couple of

726
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,919
percent of the
answer, okay?

727
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,270
Yes. And this is

728
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,269
like kind of the old
school way of doing it.

729
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:32,510
So when you see
in the textbook,

730
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,109
a lot of the stuff that
was done before with

731
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:36,270
enthalpy changes
of ideal gases

732
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,110
are usually specific heats

733
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,549
times temperature
differences.

734
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,190
I think nowadays with

735
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,709
electronic tables
and stuff,

736
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,949
these approaches like
this are just as

737
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:50,469
convenient as
doing that, okay?

738
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:54,349
Questions? That
all makes sense.

739
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,319
Cool.

740
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,639
So, since you have
no questions,

741
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:01,039
I'm sure this will be
a walk in the park.

742
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,399
So what I'm going
to give you here,

743
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,599
give me a second
I'll launch it.

744
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,800
But in short, you're given

745
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,199
an adiabatic
steam turbine.

746
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,359
What does adiabatic mean?

747
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,879
No. No heat. No heat
transfer, right?

748
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,200
So it's only
work transfer.

749
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,199
You're prescribed
the upstream state,

750
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:14,879
and you have the
downstream state.

751
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:16,319
And what I want
to know is what's

752
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,359
the rate of work
transferred out?

753
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,599
We'll continue with
this then on Monday.

754
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,400
I hope you have a great
weekend. Thank you.
