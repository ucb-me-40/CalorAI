1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,480
Yeah, so we choose to use

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,600
PICLor to get to

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,000
the states and
these properties.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Or, again, we can navigate

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,960
using the isentropic
relations.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,000
I use your steady flow
processes, right?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,440
So the change,
right, if I draw

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,520
control volume on each
of these devices,

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,119
there's going to be no
change in energy or

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,679
mass inside of each of
those devices, right?

11
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,440
And if I draw
control volume

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,559
around the entire thing,
it's the same, okay?

13
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,280
The energy that I
put in is equal to

14
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,520
the energy that
I'm taking out.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,279
To.

16
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,109
Yeah, and the heat
exchangers are

17
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:41,950
treated isoberically.

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,229
So let's start
with, again,

19
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,589
the steady flow analysis

20
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:45,629
of each of these devices,

21
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,669
develop our relations
for heat and work,

22
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:50,310
define efficiency,

23
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,710
and then let's get
into how we're

24
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,429
going to use

25
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,389
the isotropic
relations to get to

26
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,469
the actual enthalpies
there, right?

27
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,749
So again, maybe I'll
draw the first one,

28
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:04,249
and then Yeah.

29
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:07,129
Okay. All right.

30
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,010
So for our compressor,

31
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,330
right, our compressor
here is our inlet.

32
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,929
This is our
outlet, our state

33
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:14,649
one to state two.

34
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:17,729
My control volume
here looks like this,

35
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,329
do, do, do, do.
There, right?

36
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:26,090
Right? The change in
energy of the CV,

37
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,809
the change in the mass in

38
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:31,169
this CV are both
equal to zero, right?

39
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:36,729
So the DE CV dt
is equal to e.in,

40
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,449
minus E dot out, right?

41
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:43,290
And dm CV dt

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,449
is equal to m.in
minus M dot out.

43
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:50,129
Steady, steady,
gone, right?

44
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,314
So our e.in is equal
to our E dot out.

45
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:59,059
And our.in is equal
to M dot out,

46
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:02,059
which is equal to
M dot. All right.

47
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:04,459
Was that we can bring
energy in, right?

48
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,419
Work, heat, and then

49
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:09,660
dot enthalpy will
neglect kinetic,

50
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,980
and we'll say Delta
E and Delta changes

51
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,500
in potential energy are

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,740
both essentially
zero here.

53
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,459
So we'll have is aw.in.

54
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,219
We will not have a.in
because it's adiabatic.

55
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,779
We'll have our.in,
which is just dot,

56
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:30,400
and then that'll
be times H one.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,540
We could have heat
transferred out,

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,780
but it's adiabatic, no.

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,180
We don't have work
transferred out.

60
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,659
It's a compressor.

61
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:37,860
And so that's
just going to be

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,220
the enthal PH two, okay?

63
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,460
And so our w.in is
just going to be our

64
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,340
m.h2 minus H one, right?

65
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,380
We can do the
same thing now

66
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,740
for our heat
exchanger, right?

67
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,180
So our heat
exchanger like this.

68
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,779
Again, our control volume.

69
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,500
I guess I should
have indicated,

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,240
I didn't indicate
here, but hold on.

71
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,540
All right. So I have a W

72
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,620
dot write aw.in like that.

73
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,740
Okay, our heat exchanger
is a state two to

74
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,979
state to state
three, right?

75
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,220
We have aq.in,
which is here.

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,060
Again, it's the
same thing, right?

77
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,379
We don't have changes

78
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,180
in energy or mass of
the control volume,

79
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,500
neglect changes in kinetic

80
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,979
and potential energy.

81
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,699
There is no work transfer

82
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,100
associated with
this device.

83
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,860
So if we write our e.in
and our e dot out,

84
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,700
our e.in, right,
we're going to have

85
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,580
aq.in plus an m.h2.

86
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,060
Is then equal to.

87
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,900
There's no workout,
there's no heat out.

88
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,020
So that's just going to
be dot times H three.

89
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,620
So then q.in, is equal
to m.h3 minus H two.

90
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,860
We do a sanity check.

91
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,940
I'm putting heat in.

92
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,099
This should be
getting hotter.

93
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:59,780
I'd expect then
that my enthalpy

94
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,299
exiting the heat exchanger

95
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,540
is greater than
entering, right?

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,700
That makes sense.
All right.

97
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,540
All right, onto
our turbine.

98
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,220
So our turbine here.

99
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,459
Okay, here's our turbine.

100
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:29,959
Okay. Here. All right.

101
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,159
I've got, like, you know,

102
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,519
work going in
two directions.

103
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,760
I'll just call
this in general,

104
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,439
then as a W dot out.

105
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,000
There's a portion
of the W dot

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
out that goes to
the compressor,

107
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,999
and then the
portion that is

108
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,959
transferred out
and is used.

109
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,199
We'll call that all
as dot dot out.

110
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,640
What's entering here
and exiting here

111
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,439
is then at state
three and state four.

112
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,519
Again, steady flow device.

113
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,240
We don't have heat in,
right? It's adiabatic.

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,519
We don't have work in,

115
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,779
but we do have an m.h3,

116
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,259
neglecting kinetic and

117
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,699
potential energy changes.

118
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,979
And that's going
to be equal

119
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,579
to the shaft work out,

120
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,979
W dot out, no heat out,

121
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,779
and that's dot
times H four.

122
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:19,619
So W dot out is equal
to m.h3 minus H four.

123
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,899
And again, that
makes sense because

124
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,060
I'd expect the enthalp

125
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,140
at stay three to be higher

126
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,819
than four, so that's good.

127
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,459
Okay. And then
our final one

128
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,700
is another heat exchanger.

129
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,460
So here's our last
heat exchanger.

130
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,659
Okay. So the
control volume,

131
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:38,219
do do do, do, do
do do, do do.

132
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:41,659
All right. Q dot out.

133
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,039
State four to state
one. All right?

134
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,919
Again, steady flow device.

135
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,320
No neglect changes

136
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,880
in kinetic
potential energy.

137
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,839
I don't have heat in,
I don't have work in,

138
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,559
but I do have a fluid
entering, right?

139
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,679
I have an M dot
times H four,

140
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,279
and that's equal
to my heat out.

141
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,880
I don't have workout.

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,640
I do have mass out,
and then that's

143
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,759
leaving with an
enthalpy of one, right?

144
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:13,679
So Q dot out is equal
to m.h4 minus H one.

145
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,200
And that makes sense,
right, because I'd

146
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,399
expect the gas here
to be colder and

147
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,879
the enthalpy
specific enthal will

148
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,759
be less at state
one, all right?

149
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,909
That is pretty good.

150
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:27,029
Let's define now
our backward ratio.

151
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:30,589
So our back work ratio
was equal to the

152
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:36,909
w.in divided by
the W dot out.

153
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,349
So the W dot out was

154
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,869
dot times H three
minus H four,

155
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:50,349
and the w.in was
then.h2 minus H one.

156
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:53,549
The dots cancel, so
you just have H two

157
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:58,434
minus H one divided by
H three minus H four.

158
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,599
All right. Then the
last thing that

159
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,720
we need to define is
the thermal efficiency.

160
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,919
This is, you

161
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,120
know, what I already
wrote before.

162
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,200
There it is, right?

163
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,040
So the thermal efficiency,

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,759
here's the W dot out minus

165
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,719
w.in divided by
q.in, right?

166
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,999
So the W dot out, again,

167
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,919
was dot three
minus four minus

168
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,199
M dot times H two minus
one, that's network.

169
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,119
And then this
is M dot times

170
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:30,919
H three minus H two.

171
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,830
Mm dots would cancel,
could also, um,

172
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,779
Yeah, your end dots

173
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:39,820
would cancel and you'd end

174
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,499
up with let's see.

175
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,339
Three to four, two to one,

176
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,139
three to two. Yeah,
that's right.

177
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,419
Okay.

178
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:01,969
The two We

179
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:06,089
could also write
this as the net,

180
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:17,250
the net heat in 34.

181
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,850
Let me think for a
second. So that's 32.

182
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,970
I wrote something
wrong in my notes,

183
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,170
but this is right because
this is basically

184
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,569
network out minus network

185
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,249
in divided by heat in.

186
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,570
You could also write this

187
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,970
as net heat in, right,

188
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,130
which would be MDOT
times H, right?

189
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,970
Our heat is coming in
at H three minus H two.

190
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,730
Minus the heat out,

191
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,010
which is then H
four minus H one,

192
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,610
and then this
is divided by

193
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,650
M dot times H
three minus H two.

194
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,050
We can rearrange this,

195
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,410
and then this would
essentially be

196
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,210
one minus H four minus H

197
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,170
one divided by H three
minus H two, okay?

198
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,290
And this is
possible because

199
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,050
it's a cycle, right?

200
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,689
All right, there's
our formulas.

201
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:13,929
So now what we
need to do is

202
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,330
we need to figure
out our states.

203
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,530
So we need to
figure out of

204
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,210
all of these
states. All right.

205
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:33,489
All right, do, do, do.

206
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,410
Okay. All right.

207
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,210
State one, we're good.

208
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,730
State one is like this.

209
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,050
State one, we have 100
and P one is 140 pa,

210
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,330
and T one is equal to
40 degrees C, right?

211
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,650
From this, I know H

212
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,210
one and I know this one.
Is there a question?

213
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,970
Yes, please.

214
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,410
And it. So this

215
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,769
has to do with
the fact that

216
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,170
this is a cycle, okay?

217
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,330
It means that I return
to where I start.

218
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,770
If that's a cycle and

219
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,010
I return to where I start,

220
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,010
the net energy
that I put in must

221
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,370
equal to the net energy
I take out, right?

222
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,680
So in this case, I right?

223
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,200
The net work that

224
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,960
I take out is w dot
out minus w.in, right?

225
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,880
That's going to be my
net workout, okay?

226
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,360
My net energy
transferred in

227
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,200
is going to be right
from my heat, right?

228
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,320
That's q.in minus
q dot out, okay?

229
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,159
So three minus
two is my q.in,

230
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,560
or little Q in here.

231
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,040
H four minus one, right?

232
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,080
Is going to be then
my little Q out.

233
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,640
I multiply that by dot.

234
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,200
I've got q.in minus

235
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,589
q dot out divided by q.in.

236
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,100
So both are valid, okay?

237
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,020
And just to show
you that they're

238
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,940
the same thing, I
didn't need to do that.

239
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,620
H three minus H two
is here, right?

240
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,940
Minus H four plus
H one is here.

241
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,420
So you could go
from here to here

242
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,179
with simple
rearranging too.

243
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,620
But what I'm describing

244
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,100
is that in the
numerator here,

245
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,420
right, it's the network

246
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,140
out divided by
the heat in.

247
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,420
That's the definition
of the therm

248
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,700
efficiency of an engine.

249
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,460
The network out is equal

250
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,260
to my net heat in, okay?

251
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,180
And what I've written
here in this way is

252
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,100
that w dot out minus

253
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,460
w.in q.in minus Q dot out,

254
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,060
but they're the same
thing because it's

255
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,260
a cycle. Now
the questions?

256
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,479
Okay. And since that
wasn't on the video,

257
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,440
yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

258
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
Okay. The question
was about that.

259
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
All right. So we're

260
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,160
going to navigate
states now.

261
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
We got to navigate states.

262
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
All right. So
here we're good.

263
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,560
We now state one
to start with.

264
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,040
State two, State Two.

265
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,400
We're going to
start first with

266
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,680
dealing with State
two S, right?

267
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,640
State two S. State
two S is going

268
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,000
1-2 assuming

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,039
the compressor operates
isentropically.

270
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,680
I need to do that first
before I can then use

271
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,440
my isotropic efficiency of

272
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,520
the compressor to
determine my actual state,

273
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,920
right? This is the
way you do it.

274
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,280
So you write State
two S. State two S,

275
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,480
S two, Li S two is
equal to little S one,

276
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,950
and you know that P

277
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,950
two is equal to RP
times P one, right?

278
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,270
So where RP was the
pressure ratio.

279
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,190
And this problem, I'm

280
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,390
just giving you
pressure two.

281
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,309
So you wouldn't need
to know the RP.

282
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,030
You could determine
the pressure ratio,

283
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,710
but that's there.

284
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,510
So from this, I
now know my h2s.

285
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,629
I put a little S
there to denote that

286
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:56,510
this enthalpy is for
an isotropic process.

287
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,190
Okay. All right.

288
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,270
To get to state two A,

289
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,760
state to A,

290
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
I need to recall
the definition of

291
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,119
the isotropic efficiency
of the compressor.

292
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,640
Isotropic efficiency of

293
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,120
the compressor
is the ratio

294
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,440
of the minimum work

295
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
in divided by the
actual work in.

296
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,320
What is the
minimum work in?

297
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,239
What is that process?

298
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,660
Don't make me call on
Alex, right? All right.

299
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,060
It is isontropic, right?

300
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,299
It is the minimum organ

301
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,979
is with the one that's
done reversibly.

302
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:36,340
So here, that would
be h2s minus H one,

303
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,860
neglecting changes in

304
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,259
kinetic and
potential energy,

305
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:40,620
which we do for
these devices,

306
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,295
divided by H two
A minus H one.

307
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:46,170
If I rearrange then,

308
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,490
what I could have is
what H two A minus H one

309
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,130
is equal to H twos minus H

310
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,569
one divided by

311
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:00,209
the istropic efficiency
of the compressor.

312
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,810
And then this is all
plus H one, okay?

313
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,930
I know H twos. I just
determined it here.

314
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,730
H one we determined
up here, H one,

315
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,210
and E to C,

316
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,930
the isentropic
efficiency of

317
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,370
the compressor is given.

318
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,095
I know H two A,

319
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,780
P two is still
P two, okay?

320
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,300
And so with this
information

321
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,380
of H two A and the
pressure at state two,

322
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,300
I now know H two actual.

323
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,740
I can also then

324
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,180
compute the actual
temperature,

325
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,460
I use Piclor, right?

326
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,300
I can use this with
that notation and call

327
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,940
the enthalpy and
the temperature

328
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,460
because I know the
state, all right?

329
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,500
So that's how you use

330
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,340
the compressor
there. All right.

331
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,180
State two A. Let's
go with state three.

332
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,279
State Three.

333
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,559
Again, the heat
exchanger isoberic.

334
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,399
So what does it mean you

335
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,920
know about the pressure?

336
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
It's P two, P
three is P two.

337
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,760
Okay, so you know that,

338
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,280
and T three is given.

339
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,840
T three is a given.

340
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,400
So with this, you know,

341
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,320
S three, little S three,

342
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,930
and you know and
you know H three.

343
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,579
Again, just like we
did here with first

344
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,620
determining the
isontropic state

345
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,180
and then the actual state,

346
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,940
we'll start off
with state four S.

347
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,700
For state four S, S

348
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,420
four is equal to
S three, right?

349
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,940
And again, there's
another heat exchanger,

350
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,020
it means that the
pressure at state four

351
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,140
is equal to the
pressure at state one.

352
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,699
And so from this,
I know now H 4h4s.

353
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,140
All right.

354
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,899
The isotropic efficiency
of a turbine is

355
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,419
the ratio of the
actual workout

356
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,419
divided by the
maximum workout.

357
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,834
What is the
maximum workout?

358
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:07,489
Isotropic, okay?
All right.

359
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:12,169
So H three and H three,

360
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:13,770
right? And this is minus.

361
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,369
So the maximum workout

362
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:16,369
would be then if I was at

363
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:17,530
state four and I

364
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,809
arrived there
isentropically,

365
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,530
and the actual
one is H for A,

366
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,769
where a means
actual, right?

367
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,010
So then we can rearrange.

368
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,650
So then I have
what do I have?

369
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,929
I have H four
negative H for A plus

370
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:36,370
H three is equal to E to

371
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,570
T H three minus H four,

372
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,970
um, Okay, if I move
that to the other side,

373
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,850
then I'll have
minus H three,

374
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,249
okay, but there's a
negative sign here.

375
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:54,530
So then I have
to make this

376
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,169
negative and
that positive.

377
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:58,370
So the actual enthalpy
at state four

378
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,730
is equal to the enthalpy

379
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,410
at state three minus
isentropic efficiency

380
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,170
of the turbine times
H three minus h4s.

381
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,569
But the point is
that I know this.

382
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:15,389
So now I know state for A,

383
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:20,589
because I know H A
from this, all right?

384
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,429
And I know that P four

385
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,349
is equal to P one, right?

386
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,710
Just as I wrote it here.

387
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,709
And so from this,
I can determine

388
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:35,949
T I can basically

389
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:40,749
determine T for
actual, okay?

390
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:42,269
Yeah, and then obviously,

391
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,709
since I use it
as an input,

392
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:47,149
I also know my H
for A, all right?

393
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,519
Okay. And that's
pretty much it.

394
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,760
So for the case of using

395
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,839
pie color, All right.

396
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,399
So if I come back
to my efficiency,

397
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,599
so I have to modify
this a little bit.

398
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,879
So the thermal
efficiencies here,

399
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,599
H three is unchanged,

400
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,720
but H four is HA,

401
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,399
H two A minus H one,

402
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:15,159
H three is unchanged,

403
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,319
but then I have
H H two A, okay.

404
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,359
And each of those, right,

405
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,399
we could determine
by substituting

406
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,239
in from here at H
two A I have here,

407
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,799
H four A I have here,

408
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,439
H three I have here,

409
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,924
and H one I have here.

410
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,289
What's the one
thing that I

411
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:35,849
don't know, though, okay?

412
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,009
I guess I don't need
it to determine that,

413
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:39,410
but the one thing
that we didn't

414
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,290
determine yet was
the mass flow rate.

415
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,249
If you want to do that,
you need to know also

416
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:45,170
the specific volume one

417
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,849
or at the entrance
at state one.

418
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:49,410
So the specific volume

419
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,969
at state one you
could call here,

420
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:56,000
and then MDT, right?
Let's say MDT.

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,910
Is then going to
be equal to V dot,

422
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,349
the volumetric flow
rate given above,

423
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,589
divided by the specific
volume at state one.

424
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:10,189
Why at state one?
Because this

425
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:11,269
is going to typically be,

426
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:12,550
right, the volumetric flow

427
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,829
rate of air that comes in.

428
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:15,470
If air is coming
into this device,

429
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,589
it's entering
from the outside.

430
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,669
It means it's entering
from state one, okay?

431
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,470
Yeah, so it does matter,

432
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,429
you know, where
you take that up,

433
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,469
but you would call
it in this case,

434
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:27,710
it's stay one
because that's

435
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,305
where it's
entering, right?

436
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:32,259
All right. The
backward ratio,

437
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:33,539
again, we could
modify that.

438
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,659
That'll be H two
A minus H one,

439
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,899
and then H three
minus H four A.

440
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:41,740
In terms of the
temperatures

441
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,019
at the exits, again,

442
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:46,779
you can call that one
pi killer like that,

443
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:48,819
and where's my state two?

444
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,179
You can call the
other one like

445
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:56,749
that. Do do do.

446
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,990
All right. Are there
questions about

447
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,590
this before I show
you ideal gas?

448
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,429
So, for me, I personally

449
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,829
find this a rather
intuitive way of,

450
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:11,629
you know, going through.

451
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,110
So even if I could choose

452
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,269
to do ideal gas here,

453
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,509
my personal
preference is to

454
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,029
write down my
formulas and then,

455
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:20,990
you know, work
through my states

456
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,149
in this manner, all right?

457
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:25,310
Yes, please.

458
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,770
So that's in

459
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,249
this efficiency
that's given, right?

460
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:36,969
So before we had
talked about

461
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,569
the isotropic efficiencies

462
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:41,770
of compressor to turbine,

463
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,729
essentially,
devices that can

464
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:46,530
compress or
transfer workout.

465
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,410
And they are
by definition,

466
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,330
if you neglect changes

467
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,130
in kinetic
potential energy.

468
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,729
This for the
turbine, right?

469
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,809
So the ratio of the
actual workout of

470
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:58,049
that device divided by
the maximum possible,

471
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,169
all right? What is
the meaning of this?

472
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:01,609
The meaning of
this is that

473
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,529
you recognize that
in the real world,

474
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,690
things don't operate with

475
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,449
100% of their capacity.

476
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:08,529
It's Friday afternoon.
I'm up here.

477
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:10,049
I don't know
what my ETA is,

478
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,530
but I don't feel,
you know, it's

479
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,249
not 100, all right?

480
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:15,570
That's the meaning
of this, right?

481
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,189
So it tells you
that you know,

482
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,749
in a convenient way,

483
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:23,589
how to determine the state

484
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,509
at the exit of
these devices while

485
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:26,469
giving you
something that's

486
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:27,709
kind of real, all right?

487
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:29,030
But that's where it comes

488
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,509
through is with this.

489
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:31,789
And you would be

490
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,149
given this piece
of information.

491
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:35,309
The upstream condition
is always known.

492
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,869
So the inlets are going to

493
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:38,869
be given, okay,
for both of them.

494
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,389
You determine the
isentropic property,

495
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:44,909
via the way that
I did right

496
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:46,189
via the way that
I did here,

497
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:48,070
where the entrance entropy

498
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,429
is equal to the exit,

499
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:51,949
and by knowing
another property,

500
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:52,709
then you can determine

501
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:54,309
the isentropic enthropy.

502
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:55,470
And then from
that you solve

503
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,115
for the actual enthropy.

504
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:04,800
Okay. Other
questions? Cool.

505
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,359
All right. We're going

506
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,599
to stay with this
because why not?

507
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,720
What should I erase?

508
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,959
I feel like that I want

509
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,279
to keep and this
I want to keep.

510
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,159
This I'm going to

511
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,479
erase because we're
going to work

512
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:21,959
through our
properties now.

513
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:25,239
So this right?
I know that,

514
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:30,230
um All right, whatever.

515
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,949
We'll kill this,

516
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:37,149
we'll kill this.
We'll kill this.

517
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:41,669
State three will
leave like this.

518
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:43,750
State four S we'll get rid

519
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,149
of State four A will
also get rid of.

520
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,870
This will also get rid of,

521
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,390
but we'll keep
that, alright?

522
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,350
Okay, let's start with
this, first of all.

523
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,669
Changes in enthalpy for

524
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:56,829
an ideal gas can be
approximated as what?

525
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,559
Cp Delta Ts, okay?

526
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,760
So Cp Delta T here,

527
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,199
Cp Delta T here.

528
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:07,759
This for an ideal gas
can be approximated as

529
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,199
T three minus T four A

530
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:16,959
divided by T three
minus T four, okay?

531
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:20,359
The same thing
here. Cp Delta T.

532
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,279
This is then going to
be T two minus T one

533
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:30,734
divided by T two A
minus T one. All right?

534
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:33,350
From the TDS relations

535
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,989
that I wrote before, okay,

536
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:40,509
here, in this
notation is T two.

537
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,830
So the isotropic
temperature,

538
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,229
the exit of the compressor

539
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:46,510
is equal to the entrance

540
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,749
one times the ratio of

541
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:49,990
the pressures in the
antibatic index.

542
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,789
So you know t2s, right?

543
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:55,389
So you know t2s,

544
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:56,830
you know T ones,

545
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,149
and you're given this.

546
00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:01,709
You solve for T two A.

547
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,870
That's it, okay?
And vice versa.

548
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,029
You can do the
same thing for

549
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,950
right for the turbines,

550
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:21,270
tt4s is equal to
T three times

551
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,549
P four divided
by P three to

552
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,069
the kappa minus one
divided by Kappa, okay?

553
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,749
Again, you know T three.

554
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:33,110
You know this pressure
ratio as it's given.

555
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,604
You know your Kappa,
so you know T four.

556
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:39,940
All right. And so,
you know, T three,

557
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,019
you know, T
three, you know,

558
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,139
t4s from that,
you know, E to T.

559
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:46,699
And then what
you solve for

560
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:49,259
is T four A, okay?

561
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:51,060
Yes, please.

562
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:01,379
1.4. Other questions?

563
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:03,900
You can also figure
it out with PICO.

564
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,699
If you have a state, if

565
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:07,299
you have a state,
you can go,

566
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:10,179
let's say one dot cpp,

567
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:12,139
and then I'll call
that or dot CV,

568
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:13,220
and then we'll call that.

569
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,260
Chandler told me to
update the documentation,

570
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,099
but like Mario and stuff,

571
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,309
there's cheat codes.
So, say it again?

572
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:21,589
I didn't tell you.

573
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,629
Kindly, he did. He
asked me kindly.

574
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:25,509
He did ask kindly.
He did ask kindly.

575
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:25,709
Okay.

576
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:26,589
But that's how
you could call

577
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:27,750
it and then you
take the ratio,

578
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,350
but 1.4 is what
it is for air.

579
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,429
Okay? Other questions?

580
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,429
Right? And then
when it comes into

581
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:36,269
these efficiencies
for the same thing.

582
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,109
So if I want to know

583
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,829
the efficiency
here, right,

584
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,670
this is going to be
one minus T four minus

585
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,149
T one divided by T
three minus T two.

586
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:49,509
This is going to be H A

587
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:52,069
for A and T two A, okay?

588
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:53,269
And again, we're
allowed to

589
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:54,350
do this for an ideal gas.

590
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,789
It's an approximation
of changes in

591
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:58,389
enthalpy or CP
dTs, all right?

592
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:03,280
Um, if you want
to do some math,

593
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,760
okay, like we did for
the auto cycle, right,

594
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,160
this Eta H of a
Brayton cycle

595
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,079
can be shown to
be equal to one

596
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,240
minus one over the RP,

597
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,279
that compression ratio to

598
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,600
the kappa minus one
divided by Kappa, right?

599
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,159
And that's kind of nice.

600
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,640
Again, with an ideal gas.

601
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,039
Instead of going
through all of that,

602
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,520
I could break this down
into two parameters,

603
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,680
the adiabatic index
of the fluid,

604
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,160
which is an ideal gas,

605
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,039
and the ratio of
the pressure at

606
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,519
the exit to the inlet
of the compressor.

607
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,079
So P two divided by P one.

608
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,399
And with that, you

609
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,219
can get a number,
all right?

610
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:46,439
But this number
here is, again,

611
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,920
would be assuming
it will be

612
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,439
slightly different
from what you'll

613
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:56,159
compute here because in
this derivation here,

614
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,600
there is nothing
about T for actual.

615
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,680
What you would
have here is

616
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,519
the isentropic
temperature at

617
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,079
state four and
the isotropic

618
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,759
temperature at state two.

619
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:07,639
So something like
this would be, right,

620
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:09,440
an approximation there for

621
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,159
an ideal cast for the
ideal Brayton cycle.

622
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,479
And that's
analogous, remember

623
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,960
to what we did
for auto, right?

624
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,080
The auto cycle and
the diesel cycle,

625
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,600
that's the one you
would have for Brayton,

626
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,419
okay? And what
does it mean?

627
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:23,780
It means that essentially,

628
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,500
if I have a huge
pressure ratio,

629
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,020
then I'm going to
have this approaching

630
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,420
one, and that kind
of makes sense.

631
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,219
A? If I take something
and I compress it,

632
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:31,139
the temperature is going

633
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:32,539
to go up like hell, right?

634
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:34,260
You're going
to have a huge

635
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,139
temperature
increase with that.

636
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:38,379
And so intuitively,
that would make

637
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:40,340
sense to me that in
increasing that value,

638
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,940
you'll get to a
higher efficiency.

639
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,819
Alright. Yeah, and

640
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:46,539
the back work ratio,
also the same thing.

641
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,219
You know what here,

642
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:48,299
but this could
also just be

643
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,779
the temperature
differences if you

644
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:52,379
assume the ideal
gas. Alright?

645
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,029
All right. Good.

646
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:57,669
Yeah, and if you want to,

647
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:59,269
you can click on that
and follow through.

648
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:00,430
I will just caution

649
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,669
you that at
least one of the

650
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:03,110
I think the one efficiency

651
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,429
formula I looked at
is wrong for now,

652
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:05,629
but I'll update it

653
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:07,149
probably the next
time I teach.

654
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:09,549
So that'll be fun
to see next year.

655
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:13,439
All right, um, Okay,

656
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:15,759
so in terms of where
are we at in terms of

657
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,680
efficiencies as a function

658
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,800
of the pressure ratios?

659
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,880
Again, just
like we did for

660
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,440
the auto and the
diesel cycle,

661
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,759
these are the
typical values

662
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,560
you'll have for
pressure ratios,

663
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,680
and then these are
the efficiencies.

664
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,599
So somewhere between
0.35 and 0.6,

665
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,800
so 30 to 60% efficiency.

666
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,239
60%, if that was true,

667
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,679
that's a pretty
big number, okay?

668
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:38,519
Thermo electric power
plants are somewhere in

669
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,320
the neighborhood
of 50%, 45, 50%.

670
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,039
So for the
theoretical one,

671
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,119
that's a rather high,

672
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:46,499
um, If you were able
to attain that,

673
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:49,179
that would be a
rather high value.

674
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,740
Again, applications,

675
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,900
electric power generation,

676
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,820
and then aircraft
propulsion.

677
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,580
Alright, sadly, I'm not

678
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:58,979
going to have time to

679
00:28:58,979 --> 00:28:59,939
do jet propulsion today.

680
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,459
It'll be Monday,
but I want to tell

681
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:03,379
you one interesting
thing, all right,

682
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:05,419
about the Brayden
if you do want to

683
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:09,019
increase the efficiency
of the cycle, okay?

684
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:11,859
And it is called a
regenerator, all right?

685
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,659
A regenerator.
I'm going to

686
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,820
let you look at
that while I erase.

687
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:26,779
All right. All right.

688
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,659
All right.

689
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,909
All right.

690
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:53,789
All right. Before I

691
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:54,989
get into the
details of it,

692
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:57,189
I just want to tell I
want to describe this,

693
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:59,149
all right, then it will
make sense to you.

694
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:01,909
So we have this
compressor, which is here.

695
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:03,549
So something coming in.

696
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:05,429
This leaves the
compressor.

697
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,709
It goes through
this device, which

698
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,390
I'm calling a regenerator.

699
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,910
It goes from here into
a heat exchanger,

700
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,630
so a combustion chamber.

701
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,269
This then goes
down into Right.

702
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:20,749
My turbines connected
via the shaft here.

703
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:23,149
I've got some, you

704
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:25,389
know, work
transferred out.

705
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:27,549
I then have this exit,

706
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,109
which is then passing
through, again,

707
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:33,469
this regenerator, and
it's leaving, okay?

708
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:39,109
All right. Yes, please.

709
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,069
Number five.

710
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:47,574
I number things
intelligently, okay?

711
00:30:47,574 --> 00:30:50,439
Let's leave it at
that. All right.

712
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,360
So let's draw
control volume.

713
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,839
Okay? Well, let's
say something here.

714
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,279
So the fluid coming out of

715
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,439
the compressor
is warm, okay?

716
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,919
But it's not as hot
as State three.

717
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,800
So State three
is the hottest,

718
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,560
and state two is lower.

719
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,960
Out of the turbine,

720
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,120
let's say you have
gases that are hot.

721
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,680
If you ever put your
hand near a muffler,

722
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,240
hopefully not too
close, you'll

723
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,599
feel it can be warm, okay?

724
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,920
If you ride a bike behind
these, like, buses,

725
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,599
you feel warm
and you're also,

726
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,599
you know, getting
smug there, right?

727
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,999
So you have this as a
higher temperature,

728
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:22,119
and this is going out to

729
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,279
atmosphere at State six.

730
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,359
So probably this
temperature here is higher

731
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,739
than this one,
okay? All right.

732
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:29,059
And without this device,

733
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,259
you would just
be exhausting

734
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:31,379
this into the
environment, right?

735
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:32,940
So this is something
really hot.

736
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,859
Okay. And the idea here

737
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:35,899
is maybe I could

738
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:37,259
take some of the
hot, you know,

739
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:40,179
the heat out of the
exhaust and warm

740
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:41,860
up the fluid before

741
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,019
it enters the combustion
chamber, right?

742
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:47,099
Right? Now, why is that
an interesting idea?

743
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:50,979
I'll show you now
with a drawing, okay?

744
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:53,620
So let's say I draw
my control volume

745
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,779
around Um, let's see.

746
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,219
I can draw it. Let's see.

747
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:03,299
I draw it like this. Okay?

748
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,459
So I've drawn it around

749
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:06,380
the compressor,
the turbine,

750
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,820
the heat exchanger,

751
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,019
basically, the compressor,

752
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:10,460
and the regenerator,

753
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,740
right? So what do I have?

754
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,739
I have a network
w.net out,

755
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:19,780
which is leaving,
and I have Q dot,

756
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,780
which is going into
the combustor.

757
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,994
1 second. Is energy

758
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:27,489
entering or
leaving the system

759
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,529
through that regenerator
as I've drawn it?

760
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:33,410
No. So it's like
you're heating

761
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,489
your fluid without
putting any heat in.

762
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:38,969
That's it. That is it.

763
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:41,209
That's why you do a
regenerator, okay?

764
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,449
It's like for free, ar?

765
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:44,690
And very rarely are

766
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,249
things free in
thermodynamics,

767
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:47,529
but that's something
that's for free.

768
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:48,489
So you can do that.

769
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:49,729
And so it means you need

770
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:51,689
less q.in, all right?

771
00:32:51,689 --> 00:32:53,489
And if my whole efficiency

772
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:56,490
is Q dot N is in
my denominator,

773
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,369
if I make that smaller,

774
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:00,329
because I'm
preheating here,

775
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:01,609
I'm going to
automatically end up

776
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:03,734
with a higher
efficiency, okay?

777
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:06,539
All right, how does
the book talk about?

778
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,219
So what's the trick
that you need to

779
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,219
know to be able to
handle this device?

780
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:12,379
The book will talk about

781
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:16,379
regeneration
efficiency, right?

782
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:17,899
And again, I said here,

783
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:20,419
this was State
two entering it.

784
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:22,819
I have State five here.

785
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:25,819
I have State four,
which is here,

786
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:30,459
and I have State
six, which is there.

787
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,329
Five, two, and four,

788
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:36,370
right, which is there.
So I have that.

789
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,849
So there's five.

790
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,569
There's two and
four and two.

791
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:46,809
Okay. All right, so I
don't need state six.

792
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,529
All right. Okay, the

793
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,329
efficiency here or
the effectiveness.

794
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:51,809
I'm sorry, it's
called effectiveness.

795
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:53,009
So the effectiveness of

796
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:55,370
this regenerator
is the enthalpy

797
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,529
at state five minus

798
00:33:57,529 --> 00:33:59,209
the enthalpy at state two,

799
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:01,129
right, entering
the regenerator.

800
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:06,414
H four minus H two, okay?

801
00:34:06,414 --> 00:34:09,699
So five to two, that's
kind of clear, right?

802
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,859
That would essentially be

803
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:13,699
how much heat
is transferred,

804
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:18,459
right through this
process to warm you up.

805
00:34:18,459 --> 00:34:20,419
And you want that to
be a large number.

806
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:24,059
So a more effective
regenerator is increasing

807
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:25,379
the enthalpy at state

808
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,459
five without heating
from the outside, right?

809
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:31,859
That's an effective
regenerator, right?

810
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:35,589
Um, On the other side,

811
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:38,229
we have H four, right,

812
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:42,269
minus H two, right?

813
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:45,109
This is essentially H
four would be like,

814
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:47,269
kind of like the
potential, right?

815
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,709
That's the higher
enthalpy state

816
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:51,549
that's exiting
the turbine.

817
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:54,019
Um, I don't you

818
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:54,899
could say that maybe

819
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,139
you want this
to be a really,

820
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,779
really high value
because that

821
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:00,259
will or if you
had a really,

822
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:02,139
really high value
here, it may not

823
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:05,059
be as effective
of a device.

824
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,699
And because it's
leaving a turbine,

825
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:08,139
it won't be particularly
high, okay?

826
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,579
But you have something
here, H four,

827
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,419
and you want to take
enthalpy out of

828
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,379
that on the way
to six, right?

829
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:15,539
So 4-6, you're going
to cool that down,

830
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:17,779
and you're going to
transfer it in, right?

831
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:19,139
But you're not going

832
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:20,179
to be able to transfer in

833
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:21,499
more enthalpy
than what you

834
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:23,619
started with, okay, right?

835
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,579
So you're not going to
be able to get more

836
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,459
out of this than H
four minus H two,

837
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,859
since this is what
you start with.

838
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,499
And this is the
effectiveness, right?

839
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,529
Okay, so that's all you

840
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:37,810
need to know about
Braden, literally,

841
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,369
how you solved it, and

842
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,970
then this little
twist and any quiz

843
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,049
I'm going to give you
on a gas power cycle,

844
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:44,249
you should be good to go.

845
00:35:44,249 --> 00:35:45,169
There are other
things like

846
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:47,369
reheat and other
little things.

847
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:48,849
We'll probably get
into those when we do

848
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,689
vapor power cycle.
Yes, please.

849
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:54,249
So with combustion
chambers and engines,

850
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:57,329
don't you want the
highest concentration?

851
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:03,639
Like combustion Carno,
all I want is it hot.

852
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,759
The hotter it
is, the better.

853
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:06,279
That's all I care
about in Carnal.

854
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:08,159
Okay? Yes. But
you could get

855
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,479
hotter by having
more fuel,

856
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:10,479
right, and things
like that.

857
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:13,119
Enthalpies of vapor
enthalpy of combustion?

858
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,439
Yeah, you could have
that. Okay. I'm going

859
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,919
to close it here. That
was a good question.

860
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:19,199
Go bears. Sam
