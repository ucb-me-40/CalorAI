1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,040
Okay. I'm going
to get started.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,720
So today, we're
going to continue

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,480
with our entropy analysis.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,120
Why is this like?

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,030
Better? Better.
Okay. So we'll

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,310
continue with that.
Learning objectives.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,790
So after today, you'll
be able to apply

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,510
the general entropy
balance now

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,190
to heat exchanger
and also a nozzle.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,390
Okay? But first, let's

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,230
see where you're at and

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,830
your understanding
of this.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,270
So you're given the
following experiment.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,230
We have a container here,

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,910
which is kept
at 300 Kelvin

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,630
in contact with
the reservoir.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,910
The initial pressure is

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,790
1 bar, substance is air.

19
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,830
You have 1 kilogram.
So you know the mass,

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,390
and you also know

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,470
the specific
gas constant in

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,840
kilojoules per
kilogram Kelvin.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,610
This is connected to
another container,

24
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,770
which was initially
evacuated, right?

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,570
So it is zero
bar of pressure,

26
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,770
and you have this as
a volume, all right?

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,210
This is also kept
at 300 Kelvin,

28
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,130
and then you open this
valve, all right?

29
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,250
And the question is,
what is the change in

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,010
entropy after you open

31
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,290
the valve and this
system goes equilibrium,

32
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:20,650
okay?

33
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,010
So take 5 minutes,

34
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,130
look it through, and let's

35
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,330
see if we understand
this very well.

36
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,810
If we don't, we'll
go through it again,

37
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,050
and we'll do another
repetition after that.

38
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,015
Any questions before
we get started?

39
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,820
Okay, let's go.
Problem. This is

40
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,460
not the first time
you've seen this, okay?

41
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,820
Literally not
the first time

42
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,140
you've seen this.

43
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,540
So what you have here

44
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,660
is steam that's
entering into

45
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,620
a heat exchanger at this
temperature, right?

46
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,860
And it's exiting at
this temperature here,

47
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,940
and you have this
mass flow rate

48
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,860
in kilograms per
hour of it, right?

49
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,420
That steam is heating air.

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,740
Air is coming in at
20 degrees Celsius.

51
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,735
It's exiting at 30
degrees Celsius.

52
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:03,250
And you're given
also the properties,

53
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,050
so you don't have to
do PICOor for this.

54
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,570
You know the
specific enthropy

55
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,810
and specific entropy of

56
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,370
the steam entering
and exiting.

57
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,210
You're also given
the specific heat

58
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,770
of air. You have
three questions.

59
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,890
The first is what's
the heat transfer rate

60
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,570
from the steam to the air?

61
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,890
So it's a Q dot out.

62
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,210
What's the Q dot out

63
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,185
from the steam to the air?

64
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,960
What is the mass flow
rate of the air, okay?

65
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,080
And what is the rate of

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,880
entropy generation,
all right?

67
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,560
Now, to make this work,

68
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,000
the one assumption that

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,920
you have to make is that

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,000
the outside of this heat

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,720
exchanger is adiabatic.

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,320
So I do not have
heat exchange

73
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,400
happening from
the environment

74
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,480
to the heat exchanger.

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,160
I only have heat
exchange happening

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,980
between the steam
and the air, okay?

77
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,280
This one should be
straightforward,

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,240
you know, for you.

79
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,480
I would say it's already

80
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,640
launched. Go through it.

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
I said 10 minutes,
but, you know,

82
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,680
maybe a little bit less.

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,080
We'll talk
through that one.

84
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,320
And then at this
stage, after

85
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,000
you've done this one,
you've seen, like,

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
the two types of N

87
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,240
should be problems
I can ask,

88
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,400
one in the closed system,

89
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,640
one in the open system.

90
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
And from that
understanding,

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,440
you should be able

92
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,320
to generalize that to
either of the cases,

93
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
okay? Questions?
All right.

94
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,000
Round two, let's go.
