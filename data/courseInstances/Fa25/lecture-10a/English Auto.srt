1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,640
Today vapor power cycles.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,080
So after today, we're
able to analyze

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,600
a vapor power cycle

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,520
in which the fluid is

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,280
boiled and
condensed, right?

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,919
In the previous part,

7
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:17,879
we were looking at

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,079
the case where
the working floor

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,759
remaining gas
the whole time.

10
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:23,399
All right. So the

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,399
most So why do we
care about this?

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,559
We care about this because
most of our energy

13
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,920
and electricity
is produced by

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,839
this device here, right?

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,759
So what does it look like?

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,480
It doesn't look too

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,999
dissimilar to

18
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,239
the Brayton cycle
that we saw before,

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,360
which operated with gas
as a working fluid,

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,239
which didn't change phase.

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,519
The only real
difference is that

22
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,160
instead of a compressor,
we have a pump.

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,079
The heat exchanger
where we

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,724
put heat in, we
call a boiler,

25
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:52,449
turbine is the same,

26
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:55,449
and the device that

27
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,850
takes heat out is
called the condenser.

28
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,850
Of course, in Brayton,

29
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,009
we idealize it as

30
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,609
a closed loop cycle,
even though it wasn't.

31
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,009
In the case of Rankin,
it is closed loop.

32
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,049
It is closed
loop, all right?

33
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:11,789
Um, The most commonly
used working fluid

34
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:13,149
that's in here is water,

35
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:16,590
and people go to great
pains to characterize

36
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,749
and know the state of this

37
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:20,069
water through the
cycle, right?

38
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:22,989
So it's very pure stuff.

39
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:25,549
Okay, so again, work
in through your pump,

40
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:26,709
heat in through
the boiler,

41
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,070
work out from the turbine,

42
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,950
heat out from
the condenser.

43
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,029
This is how it's
represented in the book on

44
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:34,229
the TS diagram, right?

45
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,629
So the work
transfer process

46
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,975
in the ideal rankin cycle,

47
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:41,080
is isotropic, so
it's vertical.

48
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,759
The heat addition
here is two to three.

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,039
This is not right,

50
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,919
like when we did Carne
and we looked at it,

51
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:48,799
we expected this to

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,759
be and also
Sterling, right?

53
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,400
This is like a flat
line. We introduced

54
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,800
heat at a constant
temperature.

55
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,119
That does happen during

56
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,360
the heat addition
during boiling,

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,479
but when it's a sub
cooled liquid and then

58
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,599
a superheated vapor,

59
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,199
this does not
happen, okay?

60
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,640
Isotropic workout,

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,280
and then the
heat out, right?

62
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,800
One way to visualize

63
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,040
rankin or to think
about rankin again,

64
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,440
thinking about the TS
diagram is to again,

65
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,660
go back to Karno
They look and say,

66
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,940
Okay, so what
did Carn look

67
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,179
like on a TS diagram?

68
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:21,715
Here's my temperature,
here's my entropy.

69
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:24,849
Heat addition,
isothermal, right?

70
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,649
So here, work
out, isentropic,

71
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,490
heat out, isothermal,

72
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,610
and then work in
isentropic, right?

73
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,050
So this is your TH,
and this is your TL.

74
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,690
The way to visualize,

75
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,810
really rank in is
it's like trying to

76
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,689
take this box, right,

77
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,529
or rectangle and map

78
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:49,770
it onto something that

79
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,330
has a vapor dome, okay?

80
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,130
So trying to take this
and make it work,

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,440
on something like water
that has saturated

82
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,159
liquid and saturated
vapor, all right?

83
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,920
So how do you
make it work?

84
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,120
What's very important in

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
a turbine is that

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
you do not have
phase change, okay?

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,199
You want what's passing

88
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,760
through the
turbine to be at

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,719
a very high
specific volume

90
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,120
because it's VDP, right?

91
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,880
Your work is
specific volume

92
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,680
times the difference
in the pressure.

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,560
So the higher the
specific volume, right,

94
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,400
the more specific work
I'm going to get out.

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,420
So you want to be
somewhere out here,

96
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,299
and you do not
want to fall

97
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,260
under the dome, okay?

98
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,980
Actually, maybe
ideally you want

99
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,700
to come up right to
the line and be here.

100
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,100
The second reason
why you do not want

101
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,099
this work transfer
process to fall

102
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,300
into the dome is
when that happens,

103
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,700
you're going to make
it condensed phase.

104
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,460
You're going to make
droplets, right?

105
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,940
And these blades
that are in there,

106
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,060
they spin very,
very fast, right?

107
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,580
And what you
should imagine

108
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,459
is if you make a
lot of fine mist,

109
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,660
those droplets have a
high density to them,

110
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,139
and you're just
going to be hitting

111
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,980
it constantly
over and over,

112
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,820
and it's going to
erode, all right?

113
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,700
So you're
basically going to

114
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,340
erode your blades if

115
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,740
you have you
have that, okay?

116
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,390
So that's like
one part of it.

117
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,879
When we look at the
heat rejection,

118
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,720
so out of the back end
of the turbine, right,

119
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,160
where we're taking
the heat out.

120
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,600
And this is the
one part where

121
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,200
you probably could
keep things.

122
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,240
And indeed, in this almost

123
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,560
in this idealized case,

124
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,359
this process, you know,

125
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,919
happens to
pretty much look

126
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,960
isothermal basically
look isothermal there.

127
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,399
So this is, you know,
you're doing okay.

128
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,159
You condense back
to a liquid.

129
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,519
Part of the reason
why you want

130
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,039
to condense back
into a liquid is,

131
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,199
again, when you're
a liquid, you

132
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,439
have a very low
specific volume.

133
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,079
So if you think about

134
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,880
the work transferred
in, VDP.

135
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,359
I have a very low
specific volume,

136
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,279
but I'm a liquid.

137
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,759
So the amount of
work that I put

138
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,559
in is going to

139
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,679
be much less compared

140
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,989
to what I get out, right?

141
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:48,379
All right. Yeah, so

142
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,020
we have that heat
transfer out process,

143
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,220
which was isothermal,

144
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,459
and obviously since a

145
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,139
heat exchanger,
it's isobaric.

146
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,339
You have work
that you put in.

147
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,539
So you bring this up to

148
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,859
some pressure that's here,

149
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,459
and the heat
addition process,

150
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,779
right in the boiler like

151
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,380
any heat exchanger
is isobaric.

152
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,300
So the isotherm
is going to

153
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,299
look something
like this, right?

154
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,579
So essentially, when

155
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,699
you start to add
heat, right,

156
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,979
it's going to follow
this isotherm, okay?

157
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,340
So Rankin is like

158
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,979
trying to put arno like
a square peg into,

159
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,860
I don't know,
this parabola,

160
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,429
okay, to make that work.

161
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:30,199
Does that make
sense? All right.

162
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,759
Again, key
concepts are that,

163
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,079
like work transfer
is V, VP here.

164
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,479
At this case, this is

165
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,799
a very low specific

166
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,359
volume because
it's a liquid,

167
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,199
and in here, it
is very high.

168
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,840
You do not want during
this workout process,

169
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,400
you never want to
be pumping or using

170
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,959
a turbine with a
multi phase, right?

171
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,119
You want to be
single phase.

172
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,319
So here because
of this, right,

173
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,439
I'll be single phase where

174
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,879
I'm a superheated vapor,

175
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,919
single phase while
I'm a liquid.

176
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:55,359
I do get

177
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:57,079
a constant temperature
heat rejection

178
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,439
effectively if I stay
within the dome.

179
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,399
And then, given all
those other constraints,

180
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,719
you're not going to
have a constant,

181
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,139
um, TH, okay?

182
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,580
So, what that means
is when you do

183
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,259
compare yourself
to Knel with this,

184
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,939
you will choose this
as your TH, right?

185
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:13,059
But most of the
process there of

186
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:15,139
the heat addition is
not at TH, right?

187
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,260
You're at a lower at
a lower temperature,

188
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,859
which means that
you're at essentially,

189
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:19,739
right, a lower grade of

190
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:20,779
heat that you're
putting in.

191
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,659
So you'll see significant
deviations of this

192
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:25,899
compared to Carnal for
that reason, okay.

193
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,499
Okay.

194
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:31,280
Um What else can
I say about this?

195
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,279
Yeah, so is commonly
what's used.

196
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,599
You can use other
fluids. So there

197
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:35,879
are other fluids that
can be used for this,

198
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,760
but water is the
dominant one.

199
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,039
The power plants
that operate on

200
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,959
this are fossil
fuel based,

201
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,719
so I think coal and

202
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:44,999
that, but also
nuclear, right?

203
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:49,199
So nuclear systems run
on rankin systems.

204
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,220
You have different
different types

205
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,500
like pressurized water and

206
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,340
so on and so forth.

207
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,180
But at the end of the
day, essentially,

208
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,619
all that you have
from nuclear is

209
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,220
that it's still a
heat exchanger.

210
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,459
So the Q and is all
the same, all right?

211
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,619
They just have
limitations in

212
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,499
terms of the upper
operating temperature.

213
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:06,220
So if you use something
that's like fsiluel,

214
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,899
you're allowed to go

215
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:07,899
to higher temperature than

216
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,860
nuclear for maybe
obvious reasons.

217
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,140
Yes, please. Would you
want us to memorize

218
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,220
all the different types of

219
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,159
cycles? What
does that mean?

220
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,080
I want you to
make new cycles.

221
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,199
I want you to go
out and create

222
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,079
new things that are
more efficient and

223
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,000
get rich and then remember
me when you become

224
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,160
a donor to this wonderful

225
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,559
university, all
right, David?

226
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,199
Okay.

227
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,120
So, I mean, memorize
all of them.

228
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,519
I want you to able
to classify, right?

229
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,959
So what I keep
repeating here in

230
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,280
the classification is that

231
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,639
I have a power cycle,

232
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,320
and within power cycles,

233
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,839
I think of gas, right?

234
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,359
So gas power cycle or a,

235
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,199
what did I say at the
beginning, vapor, okay?

236
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,319
So what should go off
in your mind when I say

237
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,879
gas is that the
working fluid

238
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,999
should not change a state,

239
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,800
should remain
a gas, right?

240
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,359
And there because
it's a gas,

241
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:54,469
it's probably a wet.
Idel gas, right?

242
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:55,669
Which means
it's, you know,

243
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,109
life can get a lot
easier when you get

244
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,149
into the analysis, right?

245
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:00,229
So the other part of

246
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,269
the classification
is that we have

247
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,349
a vapor power cycle.

248
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,389
There are things
change phase.

249
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,470
You don't have ideal gas.

250
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,430
We have to use Pyclor.

251
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,310
Yeah, so that's kind of
the differentiation.

252
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,189
When it gets to the
device level, right?

253
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,109
I still need you to go

254
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:13,309
device by device, right?

255
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,469
So maybe I'll give
you a problem,

256
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:16,869
like, Hey, look
at this thing.

257
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,109
Here's some conditions.

258
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:19,549
Tell me, is it
good or not.

259
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,229
Tell me, is this
a violation of

260
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,109
a first or a
second law here?

261
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:24,590
Is this like a
plausible system?

262
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,989
So then I need to
be able to break

263
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:28,029
down individual
components, right?

264
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:31,460
Apply steady flow
analysis for, um,

265
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,849
conservation of mass,
conservation of energy,

266
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,849
and entropy control
volume analysis.

267
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,650
Bang, bang, bang,
bang, okay?

268
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,570
And when I get into this,

269
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,570
you'll show that, like,

270
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,929
because you have
good fundamentals

271
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:41,849
for each of those devices,

272
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:42,690
you're going to
be able to go

273
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,730
through these
things quickly

274
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,210
because it's going
to get complicated.

275
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,770
Here I have four.

276
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,650
I think at the
end of this,

277
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,930
maybe I had eight
devices, and,

278
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,050
like, I can do more, but

279
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,250
it's not hard, right?

280
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,330
It's just like, you know,

281
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,569
like anything like
any language.

282
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,049
You got to learn sort of,

283
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:55,649
you know, what's going

284
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,129
on with it, and then
it gets easier.

285
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,410
So, in a sense, you

286
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,970
should remember
the fundamentals.

287
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,650
I would say ranking is

288
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,209
a pretty fundamentally
important cycle

289
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,850
that's there, but, Yeah.

290
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,090
Okay.

291
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,210
Does that answer
your question?

292
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,050
Yeah. That was

293
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,610
long winded.
Other questions?

294
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,530
All right. So let's
get into this.

295
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,090
Let's analyze our
Rankin cycle.

296
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,970
This is Rankin here.

297
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,330
All right. I
will erase this.

298
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,410
Do we look good.

299
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,890
We'll go with this
here. All right.

300
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,300
Okay. To do. All right,

301
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,139
so we drew right,

302
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,460
I'll draw the
schematics here.

303
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,660
I'll have it there,
and then I'll

304
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,899
turn off the monitor.

305
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,339
But basically,
right, we have

306
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,780
a pump, which is here.

307
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,500
I have some w.in,

308
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,020
which I'm putting
into that.

309
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,940
That's then going
into my boiler, okay,

310
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,419
which is essentially
a glorified

311
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,580
heat exchanger,
q.in, right?

312
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,780
All right? This
is then going

313
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,500
into a turbine, right?

314
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,059
So I have here,
semi turbine,

315
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,860
like that. All right?

316
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,860
I have a W dot out
from this. All right.

317
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,220
And then this is
then going into

318
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,500
my condenser.

319
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,660
All right? Cool.
So this has

320
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,260
then a Q dot out.

321
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,300
The way that you cool

322
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,260
these condensers,
all right,

323
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,180
is actually that we

324
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,340
have usually
water can be air,

325
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,910
but a lot of
times it's water.

326
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,440
That will pass
through this and

327
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,000
then we'll put back
into the ground, okay?

328
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,359
And about half
the groundwater

329
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,800
in this country that
we take out every year

330
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,480
passes through that
device through

331
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,680
a surface surface
condenser.

332
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,320
The surface area. So like,

333
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,800
again, this is
like many tubes.

334
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,520
You have like many
tubes, right?

335
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,000
The effective
surface areas

336
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,999
that you have on
the outside of

337
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,440
these tubes are
measured in the size of

338
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,320
Cal Memorial
Stadiums, right?

339
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,039
Like, they're
football pitches

340
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,479
of area, a lot
of material.

341
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,559
So it's a huge
they're huge.

342
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,360
You'll see this on some

343
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
of your homework problems.

344
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,320
I think in this specific
case, we use cooling

345
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,360
water to reject heat

346
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,720
out of a
refrigeration system,

347
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,240
but this is what
you do, okay?

348
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,920
We're in a data
center, right,

349
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,580
in Wisconsin,

350
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,120
Microsoft's building

351
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,364
one close to
Lake Michigan.

352
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:29,369
Guess why. Okay.
Because the lake.

353
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,610
There's a lot of
water there, right?

354
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,890
So they have that
on the do cooling.

355
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,730
So anyways, that's
typically how it's done.

356
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,410
It can also be that
you loop water here,

357
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,370
and then this goes into
like a cooling tower.

358
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,649
So if you ever

359
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,090
drive by and see
a cooling tower,

360
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,370
for example,
maybe nuclear,

361
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,290
all you have here is
this cooling loop,

362
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,569
and then you're
effectively spraying,

363
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:47,169
where you're atomizing
a bunch of water,

364
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:48,330
you're letting
it cool down,

365
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,490
it settles, and you
loop it again, okay?

366
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,089
But the key element
for us is that

367
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:53,650
we have aq.in
from combustion

368
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,649
and a Q dot out
from some cooling,

369
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,810
right, which we
don't have to

370
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,730
specify for this
exact problem.

371
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,210
In terms of states,

372
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,690
just like we had with,
um, With Brighton,

373
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,290
State one will be
what's entering into

374
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,650
the pressurizing device,
let's say the pump.

375
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,050
State two is
at the exit of

376
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,970
the pump entering into
the heat exchanger,

377
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,569
State three at the exit

378
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,529
of the heat exchaner
entering the turbine,

379
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,850
and state four like that.

380
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,410
What we can do
is we can do

381
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,010
steady flow analysis to

382
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,530
each of these
devices, right?

383
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,330
So I can go here
and do this.

384
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,010
Drop my control
volume here for this.

385
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,290
Do another one here.
Do another one.

386
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,290
Another one that's here.

387
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,249
Just at the risk
of confusing,

388
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:43,780
I will get rid of that.

389
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,219
Okay, so there's
my heat exchanger,

390
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:51,220
and there's my Q
dot out. All right.

391
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,260
Um, All right,

392
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,900
so in the steady flow
analysis, right?

393
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,140
So we're going
to assume for

394
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,420
each of these devices
that we don't

395
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,579
have a change in the mass

396
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,140
of their control volumes,

397
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,499
no change in the energy of

398
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,100
the control volumes
and no change in

399
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,380
the entropy of their
control volumes, right?

400
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,260
So, what that
means is that

401
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,660
your E dot N is equal
to E dot out, right?

402
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,259
For this, which
is then your w.in

403
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:21,340
plus q.in plus
your.in times

404
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,780
H in plus velocity
in squared

405
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,004
divided by two plus
gz N is equal to,

406
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:32,670
your W dot out, plus
your Q dot out,

407
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,950
plus your dot out,

408
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,670
H out plus W,

409
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,029
so velocity out
squared divided by

410
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,235
two plus G Z out, right?

411
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:46,360
First assumption for
these since we're

412
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,079
not dealing with
nozzles or diffusers,

413
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
is you neglect
your changes in

414
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,320
kinetic and
potential energies,

415
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,360
which are there.

416
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
That's one part of it.

417
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,760
For our entropy analysis,

418
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,239
we can do our mass now.

419
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,000
Essentially,
because of that,

420
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,839
with the
conservation of mass

421
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,760
and no change in

422
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,080
the mass and the
control volume,

423
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,840
MDT in is equal to MDT
out is equal to M dot,

424
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,720
and for our entropy
analysis, ds CV dt,

425
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,280
the change in
entropy of any of

426
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,080
those control volumes
is going to be

427
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,760
equal to the rate
of entropy coming

428
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,960
in minus the rate
that it leaves

429
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,680
plus the rate that
it's generated

430
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,130
dot gen. All right.
Steady flow.

431
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,770
So this is out. And for
these cycles today,

432
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,210
we're going to
assume, right,

433
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,370
and this is how
we'll handle

434
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,770
at least the first
stage always in

435
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,970
this analysis as we

436
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,730
compute the ideal process.

437
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,610
So the ideal here
really means that

438
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,809
the pump and the
turbine are adiabatic,

439
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:48,689
and they are reversible.

440
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,010
So what that means is

441
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,289
that there is no
entropy generated.

442
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:54,410
So out of this,
it means that

443
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,490
capitals.in is equal
to capitals dot out.

444
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,889
What that means is that.in

445
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,980
times little So times

446
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,020
little SN is
equal to m dot

447
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,420
out times little S out.

448
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,060
Mass is gone.

449
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,420
What it means is that
the specific entropy at

450
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,459
the inlet is equal to

451
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,219
the specific entropy
at the outlet.

452
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,780
Good. I'm not saying
anything radical here.

453
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,740
I just reminding him.

454
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,860
Okay.

455
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,459
In case the Amazon web

456
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,220
services shutdown
affected you.

457
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
Some of you tried to
use paper tables.

458
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,459
I hope that was a
good experience.

459
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,140
This is where we are.

460
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,660
We can go now one by one.

461
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,339
If we go with our pump,

462
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:45,339
for the work
process, w.in,

463
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:47,300
what this is
going to end up

464
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,500
being is that this
is going to be

465
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,700
M dot times the
enthalpy at state two,

466
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,860
H two minus the
enthalpy at state one.

467
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,060
Good. Q.in is going to be

468
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,260
M dot times H
three minus H two.

469
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,179
To stay consistent

470
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:08,340
with the notation
that we were

471
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,780
using before to
indicate that

472
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,139
something was isentropic,

473
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,940
I will call this
h2s and H twos.

474
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,980
H one is an inlet state,

475
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,540
and H three is going to be

476
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,259
an inlet state
for the turbine.

477
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:25,299
Our W dot out then is
equal to our dot times

478
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:28,140
H three minus H

479
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,699
four because that's
at the exit,

480
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,500
and then your Q
dot out here,

481
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,059
which comes from
the condenser

482
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:37,620
is going to be your dot,

483
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,700
and that's going
to be multiplied

484
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,980
by four minus one.

485
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,370
Questions? Hearing voices.

486
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,210
Cool. It happens.

487
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:56,050
All right. Good.
So this all

488
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,290
looks good. So
we've got this.

489
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,729
We can write.
Maybe I'll stay

490
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:00,890
with this slide
just for a second.

491
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,850
From this, right?

492
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,449
So, you know, go ahead.

493
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,169
Yes, please. Why can

494
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,089
we assume that it's

495
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,810
isotropic when
there's a difference?

496
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,169
Because I'm calling
it an ideal cycle.

497
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:15,769
One. So no, no, no.

498
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,249
So why is it isotropic?

499
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:24,230
So here, So my
question to you is,

500
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,910
what are you
considering isotropic?

501
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,589
No, no, no. I mean,
which device here?

502
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:30,830
Which process am
I considering

503
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,949
an isentropic process?

504
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,869
Yes. So which parts don't

505
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,709
have a Q? There's
no Delta Q.

506
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,269
There is Q.

507
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,309
That's it. So these

508
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:49,950
are adiabatic
and reversible,

509
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,629
which means they are
isotropic, right?

510
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:52,470
You agree.

511
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,910
So when I'm talking

512
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,269
about a heat addition here

513
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:56,950
from something
at the exit of

514
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,190
which underwent an
isentropic process,

515
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,269
this would then be
so if state three is

516
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:03,549
my inlet and I have an
isentropic turbine,

517
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,389
then I have state
four S here, right?

518
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,350
So I would call this h4s.

519
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,629
Now, my heat
rejection is going to

520
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:15,189
be.h4 minus H one.

521
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:18,150
So just because I'm
denoting this as h4s,

522
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,789
meaning that to
get to that state,

523
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:20,470
I underwent

524
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,469
an isentropic work
transfer process

525
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,150
doesn't say anything
about four to one.

526
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,659
Okay? Okay. The side

527
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,380
of the room is on it.
Okay. Other questions?

528
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:40,219
Clarifications? All
right. Where was I?

529
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,100
Okay, now what
we can do is

530
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,019
we can define an
efficiency, right?

531
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,299
So what is the thermal

532
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,379
efficiency of an engine?

533
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,839
Now, N. N?

534
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:05,999
Miles. Closer.

535
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,040
Yes, please.

536
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,080
That's one minus TH over
TC is almost Carne,

537
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,319
but not LA Lakers
in the back there?

538
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,999
Okay. It's okay.
You can contribute.

539
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,559
This could be like
a Kobe thing,

540
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,140
you know, so Yes, please.

541
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,620
Name? Sid Network.
Thank you.

542
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,259
Network out w.net over.in.

543
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:34,899
I'm going to ask

544
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:35,780
you one question
on the quiz,

545
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,539
and it's going to be that.

546
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,179
Sid's going to nail
it, all right?

547
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:39,380
Okay, that's going to be

548
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,899
your only question and
spelling your name.

549
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:41,619
So there you go.

550
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:43,820
You have a thermal
efficiency of your engine,

551
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,419
the network out over
the net heat in,

552
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,259
okay? So we can
write this.

553
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:51,099
What's another way
we could write this?

554
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,269
It's a cycle. So from

555
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:02,549
a first law perspective of

556
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,590
a cycle, what
does that mean?

557
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,869
Yes, the We can plug
in the numbers.

558
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:09,229
I'm asking more like how

559
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:11,510
else can I write
this efficiency?

560
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,069
So if I drew the
control volume around

561
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:16,789
the entire device here.

562
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,989
So if I drew a control
volume around now,

563
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:27,999
this entire device, Okay.

564
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,719
And I told you
that this also was

565
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:40,439
a operating under a
steady condition.

566
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,440
What does it mean for
this control volume?

567
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,680
Yes, please. AV, Say
it one more time.

568
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,079
That's it. There's
no change, okay?

569
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,319
So on a good week,

570
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,559
you know, in a
bank account,

571
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,079
what goes in is
what goes out,

572
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,639
right? That's
where you're at.

573
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,879
So I'm saying here that

574
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,240
the thermal efficiency is

575
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,039
my w.net over my.in.

576
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,680
My w.net here is
the w dot workout

577
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,519
minus the w dot
work in, right?

578
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:17,919
Okay. Good. What must
that be equal to?

579
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,760
Net Q net.

580
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,125
What type of Q
net, though?

581
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:30,449
Excuse me. Yes,
q.net in, right?

582
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,889
This is q.net out,

583
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,210
this is q.net in,

584
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,569
and that's q.in, okay?

585
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:35,729
For many cycles, like,

586
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,249
especially when
it was Sterling,

587
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:39,930
it is much easier
to do this, right?

588
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,450
You could do it this
way. That's fine.

589
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,650
But if it was something
like Sterling,

590
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,169
you got to get

591
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,209
an adiabatic work
transfer processes,

592
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:46,890
but it's much easier
to calculate this.

593
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,809
So these are two things
that I would say to

594
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,130
David are things to

595
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,449
remember for a
cycle, okay?

596
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:54,329
This is base stuff to
remember, all right?

597
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,279
Okay. We're having fun.

598
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,880
All right, so
we have this.

599
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,519
If we did our
substitution, right?

600
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,999
So what we have
for the net out,

601
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:09,160
this is W dot out minus
w.in divided by q.in.

602
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,959
This is equal to
then.h3 minus H

603
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:22,919
four minus M dot times
h2s minus H one,

604
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,519
and that's all
divided by m dot

605
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:32,079
times H three minus h2s.

606
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,819
Right? Okay, so

607
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,499
that's one way
to do it, right?

608
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:39,140
Your masses would
basically cancel

609
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,420
and you could do
some rearrangement.

610
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,619
Another way you
could do it is

611
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,859
the q.net in, right?

612
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:49,299
Which we can write as
q.in minus Q dot out,

613
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:52,179
divided by q.in,
which is nothing but

614
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:57,645
one minus Q dot out
divided by q.in, right?

615
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:59,589
All right. So here,

616
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,790
if we do it that way,
so we have one minus,

617
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,709
the Q dot out
is going to be

618
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:07,389
dot times h4s minus H one,

619
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:14,869
and the q.in is dot
three minus h2s, okay?

620
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:16,590
And these would go away,

621
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,269
all right? All right.

622
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:23,899
And so at this point,
What do you do?

623
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:25,699
Yes, please, David?

624
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:27,620
I have a question
about the cycle.

625
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,740
The Cary efficiency of

626
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,499
one minus rolled
over to you? Yes.

627
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:35,179
Do other cycles also have?

628
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,380
I've derived you auto,
diesel, Brayton.

629
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,300
I've told you about

630
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,060
a jet propulsion
efficiency.

631
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,900
I told you that
Sterling becomes Carne.

632
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,340
So yes, I've given you

633
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,219
at least five. I'll
give you a high five.

634
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,259
And by the end of this,

635
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,100
I'll have a couple more,

636
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,539
and then I can give you
two. Alright, good?

637
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,220
They do. They have ones,

638
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,259
but, I mean, at
the end of it,

639
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:56,979
it's all the same.

640
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,980
This is nothing
but these things.

641
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,259
So that type of thing,

642
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:02,699
I would not expect you.

643
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:04,139
Actually, I would like,

644
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:05,939
be emphatic that
you do not just

645
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:08,059
go directly to
inefficiency there.

646
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,259
These types of
things, right?

647
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:10,179
I would expect you to be

648
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:12,339
able to write out and
show me what they are.

649
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,379
Okay? And you'll see
that if you look

650
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:15,580
at the practice problems

651
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,779
on Module two review,

652
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,980
I give you a fun one
called Humphrey,

653
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,699
which is a variation
on Brayton

654
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:22,779
that I gave last year.
They all loved it.

655
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,779
Okay. All right.

656
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:27,299
Good. So at this point,

657
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,459
what do we do,
though, David?

658
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:31,859
So now I have the
formulas, right?

659
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:33,939
So I'm asked to what
I wanted to get

660
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,139
here was the thermal
efficiency of the cycle.

661
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:39,939
I have a formula for
this. Now, what do I do?

662
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,019
Derive Yeah, you
need to get them.

663
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:46,219
And the sense of
this is water,

664
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,729
what do I use?

665
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:51,439
Not ideal guess.
Hopefully not.

666
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:54,279
Okay. All right.
Yeah, so that's it.

667
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,479
So we can start
to try to figure

668
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,960
out if we know any
of these properties.

669
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,399
So what's given in
our problem, now

670
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:59,600
that I've done
the derivation,

671
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,840
I can tell you
what's typically

672
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,039
given in a rankin problem.

673
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,359
What's typically given in

674
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,879
a rakin problem is

675
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,479
state three. Why
state three?

676
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,040
Two things. The first

677
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,759
is that it's the
hottest point.

678
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,400
This is where you're
transferring heat in.

679
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,360
It's also the point of

680
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,759
hottest pressure,
all right?

681
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,319
So what literally
sets the limits

682
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,079
of the efficiency
of this cycle is,

683
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,439
can I make a boiler that

684
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:22,119
does not explode, right?

685
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,119
Can I make a boiler
that does not basically

686
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,199
melt and it's made of
materials, all right?

687
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:30,599
So here, All right,
we're given state three,

688
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,279
and because it's a
superheated vapor

689
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,879
is super critical
sometimes,

690
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:35,919
you're going to be
given a T three here,

691
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,999
in this case of

692
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,199
350 degrees Celsius and

693
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:45,399
a P three here that's

694
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:47,439
equal to three megapascal,

695
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:50,720
so 30 times
atmospheric pressure.

696
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,639
These are not
particularly high values.

697
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:53,799
Yes, please, Mao.

698
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:57,559
Why would you connect
the water from

699
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:05,384
the condenser One
more time for me.

700
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:09,489
I like the water that
goes through condenser

701
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:10,969
and for

702
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:16,529
the boil water that's
where it goes through.

703
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,169
So the thing is that

704
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:19,969
the water that you would

705
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:21,049
put into this condenser

706
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:22,370
that I'm not showing
here that I'm

707
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,249
representing as
Q out is water

708
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,969
that's great
for humans and

709
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:29,059
like the worst diet you
could give a machine.

710
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,709
So they contain
things that

711
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,469
will corrode
these components.

712
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:34,189
They'll calcify,
they'll like

713
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:36,789
put limescale and
stuff into it.

714
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,349
The water that's, like,

715
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:39,910
inside here that
you boil is,

716
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,750
like, the purest water.

717
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,389
It doesn't contain
anything that can, like,

718
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:46,270
precipitate and
destroy a boiler.

719
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,230
My buddy used to work
for Mel like Toledo,

720
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,029
and he solds instruments
that would monitor,

721
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:51,990
like, water quality
in the plant.

722
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,309
So you could do
something like that,

723
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,550
but there will be a cost,

724
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,149
and the cost will be that,

725
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:59,109
you know, this will look
like it's on a very

726
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:01,870
unhealthy an enjoyable
but unhealthy diet.

727
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,975
Yes, please.

728
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:06,159
It's like a non
ethical question.

729
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,959
Is there ever a reason to

730
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,399
not amin generator in
any of these cycles but

731
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:13,559
it seems like such an easy

732
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,970
I mean, it all depends.

733
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,090
So you're going to be able

734
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,529
to answer that question

735
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:18,250
by the end of the course

736
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,329
because you're
going to be able to

737
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:20,610
turn this into
efficiencies.

738
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,529
And if you know money
and how things cost,

739
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:24,009
you can turn that
into, like, you know,

740
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,329
several year ROI, and

741
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:26,489
then you go to
your boss and say,

742
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:28,410
Hey, here's the payback
period on this.

743
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,130
This is the time frame,
and they all have

744
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,090
a policy if it's

745
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,489
maybe like when I
worked two years,

746
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:34,929
if I could make a project
that showed that I

747
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:35,729
could make the money back

748
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:36,810
in less than two years,

749
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,849
we got to do that.

750
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:39,809
All right. Other
questions?

751
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,609
Okay, so we're doing
properties now.

752
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,009
So we have this? Water is

753
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:43,970
a pure substance.

754
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,209
So we have complete
information.

755
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:47,649
I know H three and
I know S three

756
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:50,849
specific enthropy and
specific entropy here.

757
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:55,769
Great. I To state
four to state four,

758
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:58,809
again, we did the entropy

759
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,329
control volume
analysis there.

760
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,729
We showed that for

761
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:06,850
adiabatic reversible
processes isentropic.

762
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,770
Steady flow means
we don't have

763
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,889
change in entropy in
the control volume.

764
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,889
The isentropic part
means we don't have

765
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:14,649
entropy generation
because it's

766
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:17,239
single inlet, single
outlet, right?

767
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:20,109
S in is S out.

768
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:23,469
What is the S in?

769
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:24,989
There was S three,

770
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:29,229
the out is that S four
is equal to S three.

771
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:31,150
The other piece of
information which

772
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,789
is typically going
to be given in

773
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:37,350
a ranking process
is the pressure.

774
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,949
P four, in this case,

775
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:41,989
it's 75 pa. What

776
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,999
determines this
pressure is

777
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,519
the temperature of
the cooling water.

778
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,919
So basically, you would

779
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,519
love this pressure
to be zero.

780
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,479
What sets this temperature

781
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,320
is you bring in
cooling water or air,

782
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,719
and you blow that over the

783
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,999
outside of these tubes,

784
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,919
and it brings it to
some temperature.

785
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,319
You have that temperature,

786
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,879
and you know that
this is going to be,

787
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:02,879
you want to bring
this down to

788
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:05,320
being a saturated vapor.

789
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,599
So with that
temperature and

790
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,199
knowing that it's
a saturated vapor,

791
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:10,319
it's going to set
the pressure, okay?

792
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,279
75 kPa, it's okay.

793
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,999
All right? That's on

794
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:17,440
the higher side
of a value.

795
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,879
So this temperature
here, if you look

796
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:20,520
at the saturation
temperature here,

797
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,999
my guess is that it's
over 30 Celsius there.

798
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:23,634
All right?

799
00:29:23,634 --> 00:29:26,549
Okay. But the
point is that with

800
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:29,829
this, I have, right?

801
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:30,429
I could have

802
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:33,509
complete information
from this process.

803
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:37,229
It means that I
know my my H four.

804
00:29:37,229 --> 00:29:38,589
I could also know T

805
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:40,829
four if I cared
about it, all right?

806
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:41,790
And to be consistent

807
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,509
with what I wrote before,

808
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:44,750
because it's isentropic,
I'll write h4s,

809
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,949
and let's say t4s.

810
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,829
Going along this to

811
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:55,349
state one to state
one. All right.

812
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,910
So this is a condenser,

813
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,429
this is a heat exchanger.

814
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,069
So it means that P one

815
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,269
is going to be equal
to P four, right?

816
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:03,669
We're not going to
have a pressure

817
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:04,829
drop across that device.

818
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:05,670
The one piece of

819
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,029
information that
is implicit,

820
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:07,390
I believe,

821
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,469
in most rankin
problems, and again,

822
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:10,710
this is what
differentiates

823
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,190
from a Braden analysis,

824
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,549
is that it's a condenser.

825
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,950
What comes out
of a condenser?

826
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,024
What is the purpose
of a condenser?

827
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,980
Minus Vf over Vg
minus Vf is one.

828
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,139
We call it vapor
quality when

829
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:23,380
it's one, you're a vapor.

830
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,980
So if it's not
one, what should

831
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,900
you be when you're here
when you're a liquid?

832
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,419
If you're not one, you're
zero binary, okay?

833
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,419
So the quality at
state one is equal

834
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,069
to I'm going to

835
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,429
give everyone on
this side a zero.

836
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:39,869
That's what you're
going to get, okay?

837
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:42,069
So this is the condensed
phase here, right?

838
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:43,029
So you're a liquid.

839
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:44,629
Your vapor
quality is what?

840
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:46,349
Nah, zero. Okay.

841
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:47,670
It's good. This is what's

842
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,070
impl in the ranking.

843
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,749
It will not be mentioned

844
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:50,629
to you since you were in

845
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:52,309
this lecture and I
spent 5 minutes on it.

846
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,709
I expect you all
to know that.

847
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,230
I know you. I
know your names.

848
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,229
If I grade this and you

849
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,390
don't have it,
you're all done.

850
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,750
I'll learn his name later.

851
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,829
Allright? So you have
this P one and P four.

852
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:04,029
And from this,
you'll have H one,

853
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,710
and you will
have you'll have

854
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,509
H one and you will
have S one, okay?

855
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,789
If I hear more talking,
I'm going to call

856
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:14,830
on you and spend 5 minutes

857
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,949
on you, all
right? It's good.

858
00:31:15,949 --> 00:31:17,749
So H one and S
one, you know,

859
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:19,150
and now we come
into the pump.

860
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,389
Now we have state two.

861
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:22,149
So in state two, again,

862
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,749
this is the ideal
case, right?

863
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:28,709
So, and the first thing

864
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,029
is you need to look
forward, right?

865
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,549
So with state
two connected to

866
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:33,149
state three of a
heat exchanger.

867
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:35,549
So since I know the
pressure at state three,

868
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:37,269
it means I know the
pressure at state two.

869
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:41,899
P two is equal to P
three, one, okay?

870
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:44,169
That's on one side
of the state.

871
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,849
On the other side
of the state, you

872
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:47,210
have a pump

873
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,410
that's operating
adiabatically and versibly.

874
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,010
When I do the
control volume

875
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,490
analysis with the entropy,

876
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,850
they're steady flow,

877
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,690
so there's no change in

878
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,089
entropy of the
control volume.

879
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,410
It's isotropic is
adiabatic and reversible,

880
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,010
means there's no
entropy generation.

881
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,569
S.in is S dot out.

882
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:05,730
Because it's steady flow,

883
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,169
dot in is M dot out,

884
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:08,889
which means that S two is

885
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,504
equal to S three, okay?

886
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:13,439
Or, I'm sorry, S two is

887
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,359
equal to S one, right?

888
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,520
Here, right? Because
it's two to one.

889
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,879
So S two is equal to
h is equal to S one,

890
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,239
which we had there.

891
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,640
And it means then we're

892
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,919
basically able
to get H two,

893
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,399
right, h2s out of that.

894
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,359
Okay? So all of that,

895
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,920
you would just
put these into Pi

896
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,199
color and you would

897
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:37,000
then get out
the enthalpies

898
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,839
that you need, right?

899
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,800
Right?

900
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,279
These are the enthalpies
that you would

901
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,240
need to determine
the efficiency,

902
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,559
which was the goal, right?

903
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,239
So let's just look.
Are we correct?

904
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:50,479
H4h 4h4s here, right?

905
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:53,439
H one, you have
H one here,

906
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:59,679
H three and h2s
are here and here.

907
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,640
Questions? Yes, please.

908
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,400
Finding H's.

909
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,399
So if I tell you
it's just ideal,

910
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,159
that's ideal, it's that.

911
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,959
What do you think
I would give you?

912
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,519
What additional
information would

913
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,239
I have to give you

914
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,679
if it was not isotropic?

915
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,519
What do you think
I would provide?

916
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,549
Next. E of what?

917
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,299
That's it. So basically,

918
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:32,219
we define what we call

919
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:35,060
isotropic efficiencies
of a turbine,

920
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,860
of a compressor,
of a pump.

921
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,660
So if it wasn't ideal,

922
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,779
I would say something
to the effect of,

923
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,819
you know, here's a turbine
that operates with

924
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:45,659
an isentropic efficiency
of 0.8, right?

925
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:46,980
And so if I told you that,

926
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,059
so let's say I have
my turbine and I have

927
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:52,579
this isentropic
efficiency of 0.8, right?

928
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:56,379
The isentropic
efficiency is

929
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:58,700
W dot actual divided

930
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,139
by W dot isotropic, right?

931
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,499
So for a steady flow
device, in our case,

932
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,699
that would look
something like

933
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:07,499
H three minus H

934
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:12,380
for a divided by H
three minus h4s.

935
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,860
I just went through
the exercise

936
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,339
of determining h4s.

937
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:16,939
This is 0.8.

938
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:18,939
H three is always
going to be given,

939
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:20,379
then you solve
for H four A,

940
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:22,019
and that's the
actual. Yes, please.

941
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:26,819
I thought that No.

942
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:30,419
W is not TDS.
No, that's a no.

943
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,779
The whole point of work
when we start off as

944
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,219
a basic analysis
is we treat

945
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,940
these as isotropic
devices.

946
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,499
What differentiates
work from

947
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:40,219
heat is entropy, okay?

948
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,939
I assume there
was just lots of

949
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:45,860
midterms this week
and we're all cooked.

950
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,179
Thank you. I'll be a
little nicer next time.

951
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,579
Sorry. Okay. All right.

952
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:51,499
Other questions?

953
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:52,699
Although they're
good questions.

954
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,499
Yes, please, in
the back. Name?

955
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:56,619
Elias.

956
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,229
I mean, I would say for

957
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:09,349
a rank in cycle,
you will learn.

958
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,109
You will know this
and it will become

959
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,989
second nature to
think about it.

960
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,789
I can't say right now if

961
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,509
I'm going to draw
it pictorially.

962
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:18,709
At the moment, I feel in

963
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:20,270
the world of large
language models,

964
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,669
everything can be
represented as text.

965
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:23,069
So maybe I'll
just say like,

966
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:23,429
Hey,

967
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:25,109
these are the components
like I have here.

968
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:26,470
I have a rank in cycle

969
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,350
consisting of a
pump, a boiler,

970
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,990
a turbine, and
a condenser,

971
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,269
and here's some
properties now

972
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:32,469
analyze the efficiency.

973
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:33,269
That's probably how I

974
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,869
would give you a problem.

975
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,119
My question is always

976
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,039
know, let's step
back a second.

977
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,440
A condenser is a subset
of a heat exchanger.

978
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,799
What do I say
literally every time

979
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:48,559
I say the word heat
exchanger in this class?

980
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,999
It's an isoberic device.

981
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:54,199
A heat exchanger is by
definition isoberic.

982
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,119
That should be
in your head.

983
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,199
I'm not going to
tell you that.

984
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,239
At the end of a condenser,
he, for example,

985
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,519
is never going
to forget that

986
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,840
the quality at the exit

987
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,039
of a condenser is zero,

988
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:02,999
that it's going to come

989
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:04,039
out as a condensed state.

990
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,319
I'm also never
going to forget it.

991
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,079
I think those are things,

992
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,399
but this comes
with practice and

993
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:12,359
looking and having that?

994
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:15,439
Other questions?
Yes, please.

995
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,840
Area of this graph.

996
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,479
So if I took the
temperature and I

997
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,919
multiplied it
by kilojoules

998
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,920
per kilogram there,
what are my units?

999
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,099
So what would that

1000
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,419
be a total thing or
a specific thing?

1001
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:37,940
Yeah. Other questions?

1002
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:43,539
David? This is
combined with cycle.

1003
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:45,739
Where was from

1004
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:48,739
the, that's an
excellent question.

1005
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,939
I feel like you read ahead

1006
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:51,059
and are setting me up.

1007
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:51,820
This is wonderful.

1008
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,819
I'll answer it
in a second.

1009
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:53,539
Other questions?

1010
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:55,499
You're going in the
right direction though.

1011
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:58,819
If not, okay. So this
is how it looked like.

1012
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:00,339
So again, I've
represented all of what

1013
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:02,059
I wrote here on this.

1014
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,099
So there's the X one.

1015
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:04,419
Here's a good reason
to read ahead.

1016
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:06,139
Sometimes you'll
see the answers.

1017
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:09,019
Okay. Right, so this

1018
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,139
is how this looks
like on the

1019
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:11,659
TS diagram with
those states.

1020
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:12,699
Here's how it
would look like

1021
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:13,820
on the PV diagram.

1022
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,099
What you'll note
through all of

1023
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,419
this is that we
stay below the

1024
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:17,579
super critical or

1025
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,739
the critical point
of water, okay?

1026
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:22,940
Most modern power plants,

1027
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,619
nuclear fossil
fuel based ones,

1028
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,539
do not operate with this.

1029
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,899
They go Boilers are now
made nowadays to be

1030
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:33,299
able to withstand
much higher

1031
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:35,619
pressures there.

1032
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,059
And so this allows them,

1033
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,619
when they do the heat
addition process,

1034
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:40,579
to go into a super
critical regime.

1035
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:42,420
Now, to remind you
about super critical,

1036
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,909
super critical is I cannot

1037
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:46,429
differentiate
between a liquid

1038
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:47,989
and a vapor, okay?
They are one.

1039
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:49,589
They're
indistinguishable, right?

1040
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:50,229
Why is that?

1041
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,869
Here, I'm a
saturated liquid.

1042
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,510
Here I'm a
saturated vapor.

1043
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,309
At this point, they

1044
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,389
merge and they're
critical.

1045
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:56,829
So the closer you get
to the critical point,

1046
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:58,309
it becomes harder
and harder to tell

1047
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,829
the difference until
you cannot, okay?

1048
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:03,949
The very commonly used
supercritical fluid

1049
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,614
is CO two to make
decaffeinated coffee.

1050
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:07,799
Alright, maybe that's what

1051
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,440
you guys are drinking
today, alright?

1052
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,079
So this is what
you'd have.

1053
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,559
So this is then the case.

1054
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,519
What you'll note here

1055
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,799
is when I have
three to four S,

1056
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:17,319
I am falling
below the dome,

1057
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,559
so that could be a
little bit problematic.

1058
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,880
I'm above the temperature,

1059
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,279
but I don't know
the pressure here.

1060
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:24,079
So I'll show you
the PV diagram,

1061
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,359
and you see this
process is above that.

1062
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:33,619
Questions? Questions?

1063
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,780
Why are they relevant?

1064
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,699
Because you asked me,

1065
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,899
why am I doing isentropic?

1066
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,979
I'm doing isentropic
because it's ideal.

1067
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,740
The way that we make
something actual

1068
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,979
and not ideal for

1069
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:54,659
work transfer
devices is we

1070
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:56,619
talk about isotropic
efficiencies,

1071
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:59,779
which is the reality
divided by the ideal for

1072
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:01,099
a turbine and the exact

1073
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:03,139
opposite vice versa
for a compressor.

1074
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:05,219
It's an easy
way in ME 40 in

1075
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,739
a sophomore level class to

1076
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:09,379
take something that's
ideal and make it real.

1077
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,659
Yes. That's what I said.

1078
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,859
Okay, good. Other
questions? Okay.

1079
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:20,059
Yes, we want to look
at efficiencies,

1080
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:23,099
a modern fossil
steam power plant,

1081
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,419
the thermal efficiency is

1082
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:26,139
about 40%, which is
a pretty big value.

1083
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:28,459
A nuclear plant is 34%,

1084
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:29,219
and the reason why

1085
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:30,419
it's lower is
that there are

1086
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:31,859
safety reasons for
how high you can

1087
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,740
let T three go
in the nuclear?

1088
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,775
It's conservative
industry.

1089
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:38,249
Okay, that's good.

1090
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:41,449
To David's point about
combining cycles,

1091
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:42,809
which I won't even
do in the next one.

1092
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,689
Maybe it's a
lecture after that,

1093
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:46,929
is that the exit of

1094
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:49,769
the Brayton cycle has
very hot gases, right?

1095
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:50,889
So we were talking
about using

1096
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,289
regenerators to
recover some

1097
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,169
of that and use it.

1098
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:55,409
You could also just hook
it up and use it as

1099
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:57,849
the Q in to what's
called the bottom cycle.

1100
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:59,169
So you could go in with

1101
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:02,410
that heat out of the
exhaust of a Brayton,

1102
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,969
put that into a
heat exchanger

1103
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:04,889
that would be, let's say,

1104
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:07,089
the boiler of a rakin

1105
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:09,129
and take that
lower grade heat

1106
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:10,689
and still get
power, all right?

1107
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:14,899
This is, um, something
that is done, okay?

1108
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,619
What fluids would you use?

1109
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,019
You could try
to use water,

1110
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,099
but with water, right,

1111
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:19,819
to make that work,

1112
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,059
you need high temperatures
and all of that.

1113
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,699
The heat that comes
out of the brain

1114
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,339
and the exhaust may
not be warm enough.

1115
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,860
So what you might
do is to select

1116
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,899
a fluid that boils
easier, okay?

1117
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:31,379
So fluids that
boil easier are,

1118
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:34,659
um, refrigerants.

1119
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:37,899
So refrigerants are there.

1120
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:42,179
So R 134 A's
are an example.

1121
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:44,019
Carbon dioxide
is another one.

1122
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:45,459
Carbon dioxide is

1123
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:48,099
a very commonly
used refrigerant.

1124
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:49,059
A lots known about it.

1125
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:50,339
There's a lot of
benefits to it,

1126
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:51,579
but you could
use that to be

1127
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,499
basically running
the bottom cycle.

1128
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:56,699
Those are commonly
called organic ankin.

1129
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:58,899
So organic ankin is
like, Okay, not water.

1130
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:00,220
I'm going to use
a different fluid

1131
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,579
that's more like
a refrigerant,

1132
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:03,419
and I'll take care of the

1133
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,419
lower grade heat with it.

1134
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:06,980
The one thing I'll mention

1135
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,179
here is that you can
also run CO two,

1136
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,459
since I mentioned super

1137
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:12,144
critical here for
Rankin and water,

1138
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:13,629
You can take CO two and

1139
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:15,229
also run it as a rankin.

1140
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:16,829
And what's
interesting here

1141
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:18,269
is for these cases,

1142
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:20,269
while you would guess
that this would be

1143
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,669
a vapor cycle because you

1144
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:23,549
would expect some
condensation to occur,

1145
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:25,189
the examples that I looked

1146
00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:26,669
up before I came
today actually

1147
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:28,109
showed this running all in

1148
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:29,510
the supercritical regime,

1149
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,069
which resembles wet?

1150
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:33,549
What cycle looks
like that?

1151
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,229
So I have a fluid that I

1152
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:38,829
cannot differentiate
from a gas there,

1153
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,549
and I have no condensation

1154
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:41,909
and no phase
change happening.

1155
00:41:41,909 --> 00:41:44,109
What does that
look like? David?

1156
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:46,469
Is it a car? Not a carnal.

1157
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:48,910
The temperatures
are not constant.

1158
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,649
So what power cycle did we

1159
00:41:51,649 --> 00:41:54,489
just analyze before that
had no phase change?

1160
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:02,129
Sorry, so the B
Brayton, right?

1161
00:42:02,129 --> 00:42:03,609
That might look like
Brayton, right?

1162
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:05,490
Brayton, you had basically
the heat addition

1163
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,169
and out with it there.

1164
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:08,839
Okay? Yeah, and you

1165
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:10,199
can read about it. It's
pretty interesting.

1166
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,360
So where people
talk about gaining

1167
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,519
efficiencies and
what they do,

1168
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:13,720
this is one
area of the DOE

1169
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,119
Department of Energy
that was looking.

1170
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:15,879
You can read about

1171
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:17,959
a ten megawatt power
plant that went with it,

1172
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,719
okay? Where is this going?

1173
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,839
Where is this going?

1174
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,359
So that's one
example of, again,

1175
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:25,000
where I took two cycles,

1176
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,960
and I kind of put
them in series.

1177
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,879
We talked about

1178
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,320
regenerators before
with Braden.

1179
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,079
We'll talk about that in

1180
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,119
the context of Rankin.

1181
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,359
Another way that
you could do

1182
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:34,079
this is the following.

1183
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,999
So another way to
boost efficiency in

1184
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:38,399
a cycle is with
what's called reheat.

1185
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:40,039
So what is it? It's
original rankin.

1186
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,199
I got a boiler, a pump

1187
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,559
a condenser,
and a turbine.

1188
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,680
All I do is I
take the exit,

1189
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,470
um, you know, fluid here
out of the turbine.

1190
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,789
I run it again through

1191
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:51,469
my boiler and then send it

1192
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,150
back into a lower
pressure turbine

1193
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,669
that's connected
in series, okay?

1194
00:42:54,669 --> 00:42:56,229
So next lecture and

1195
00:42:56,229 --> 00:42:57,509
the one after that
are going to be like

1196
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:58,869
additional tricks
that we can use to

1197
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:00,749
squeeze every bit of

1198
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:02,429
energy out of
that Q and we

1199
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:04,349
have to get into
work, okay?

1200
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:05,669
With that, I'm
going to close it.

1201
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,070
Thank you so much for
your participation,

1202
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,949
especially yours, for
letting me have that.

1203
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:10,389
I feel like that was
very good, okay?

1204
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:12,629
Alright, have a good one.
