1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
Oh, it's loud.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,080
Okay. Entropy today.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,940
We're going to look
at entropy changes

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,820
for pure substances,

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,260
and we're going
to talk a bit

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,740
about really the
utility of this,

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,819
which is isotropic,

8
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:22,219
basically isentropic
processes there.

9
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,899
Um. I thought for a
second, of course,

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,579
you've all done your
pre work and reading,

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,980
and I know you're
all up to speed

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,259
and not concerned at
all about quiz one.

13
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,499
So the point is
entropy is a very,

14
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,259
like, weird thing, okay?

15
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:38,179
We don't measure
it. If anyone

16
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,459
tells you they really
know what it is,

17
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:40,659
you do not trust
that person.

18
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:42,540
That's like the first
rule of entropy.

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,389
Um, The way that I like to

20
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:48,429
think about it, and
this will become, like,

21
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:49,869
clearer when we get

22
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:52,029
into when we
get into, like,

23
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:55,309
power cycles is, you know,

24
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:57,629
you remember, like, here
we had the pressure,

25
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,470
you know, pressure volume.

26
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,149
You say, okay, I
want to be able

27
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,199
to, um, you know,

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,879
maybe, you know,

29
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,799
I got some state, you
know, that's here.

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,999
Let's say I can really
superheat, you know,

31
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:13,919
water vapor to, you know,

32
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:17,520
to this very high,
you know, superheat.

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,279
And then what, okay?

34
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,879
So basically, I can
take the boiler,

35
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,799
read it can really heat.

36
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,159
I can get you up
to this state.

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,799
And one of the
problems when

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,519
you're analyzing
turbines and

39
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,879
all these devices
to get power

40
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,639
out of it is
it's difficult

41
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,399
to think about wre to sort

42
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,919
of draw next, okay?

43
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:37,869
And entropy is
going to help us.

44
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,099
It's pretty much going

45
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,179
to help you to
be able to say,

46
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:41,539
Okay, I'm going to end up,

47
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:42,619
you know, maybe down here.

48
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,459
The way we're going

49
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,419
to represent this, though,

50
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,740
is not on what's
called the PV diagram,

51
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,500
but on TS diagrams.

52
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:48,739
Okay?

53
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:49,579
And again, you did

54
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:50,699
your reading and
all of that.

55
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:51,939
So what you'll
remember from

56
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:55,019
the Carne cycle is
that essentially

57
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,299
the TS diagram for

58
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,899
Karnea looks
like that, okay?

59
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,899
So I transfer heat
isothermally in.

60
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:06,459
I have a reversible
turbine, right there.

61
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,620
So isropic okay,

62
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,030
means like It's

63
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,550
constant entropy
from this state.

64
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,750
I take heat out here,

65
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,110
and then I transfer

66
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,870
work in reversibly
with a pump, okay?

67
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,750
So I've introduced a word

68
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,349
for you here, isentropic.

69
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,710
So this ability
that, you know,

70
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,309
we can have for
our work devices,

71
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:29,430
especially our
steady flow ones,

72
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,269
to move up and
down vertically

73
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:32,910
like that is
helpful, okay?

74
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,190
The other important
thing is the area

75
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,150
enclosed inside of here
is the net heat in,

76
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,590
which for a cycle,
what is that equal to?

77
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,470
Okay. Hand up, name.

78
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,710
It could be that. I'm
thinking like this,

79
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,510
but this is an
area, right?

80
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,469
So if I did an area
of a PV diagram,

81
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,909
let's say I gave you a PV

82
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,510
diagram that
looked like that.

83
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,870
What would be that
area? Work. Net work.

84
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,630
Okay? And what I'm telling

85
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,790
you here is that
this is net heat in.

86
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,230
So for a cycle,

87
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,550
in order for me to end up

88
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,030
at the same place
where I started,

89
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,779
what must the net heat
in be equal to? Name?

90
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:23,300
A.

91
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,380
Say it again. AV. Now,
work out. AV, right?

92
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,979
That's it.

93
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,340
Okay? We got the right
side of the room.

94
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,500
Point to them, okay?

95
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,700
Just kidding. You guys
all said good thing.

96
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,340
That's it. Okay? So again,

97
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,340
it's going to help you to

98
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,180
connect processes, right?

99
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,900
It's going to help
us, like, a compass,

100
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,100
guide us where we need
to go, one part of it.

101
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,660
And the second
part of it is it

102
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,060
may prove helpful when

103
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,540
we want to analyze
things like,

104
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,980
you know, the power output

105
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,080
of the device, okay?

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,380
Is that good before we

107
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,060
now really we into this?

108
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,980
Okay, so just remember
it's helping us.

109
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,340
It's helpful.
It's a friend,

110
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,900
not a foe. All right?

111
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,180
Okay. So, but first,

112
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,139
before we can use a
compass and walk,

113
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,219
we got to learn to crawl,

114
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,500
right? So here's crawling.

115
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,340
So I have two blocks.
Let's say here.

116
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,699
One hot, one cold.

117
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,339
Maybe I'll stay in view.

118
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,179
Sorry for those watching.

119
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,899
All right, I got
one hot block.

120
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,099
I have a cold
block, right?

121
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,794
So T one is greater
than T two.

122
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:28,449
And let's say that this
is a reservoir, okay?

123
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,929
So a reservoir means if I

124
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,849
transfer heat out
of it or into it,

125
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:33,890
the temperature does
not change, right?

126
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,729
This just means I have

127
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:36,169
a huge hunk of
metal, right,

128
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,450
that's hot and
maybe a huge one

129
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,089
that's cold, and they're
connected, right?

130
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:42,050
So I can transfer
heat in and out.

131
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,769
I'd like to draw a
control volume first

132
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:47,849
around the one
on the left.

133
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:48,849
And I would like to

134
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,369
draw another
control volume

135
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,729
around the one on
the right, okay?

136
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,889
Let me erase this.

137
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,289
All right,

138
00:04:58,289 --> 00:04:59,449
let me actually read
the problem though,

139
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,169
because this is,
blah, blah, blah.

140
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,249
Two bodies are placing

141
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:03,570
contact to get some heat.

142
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,489
So what's the change in

143
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,009
the entropy of each body?

144
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,449
So each body here, right,

145
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,210
I'm going to talk about
the change in entropy

146
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,329
of this control volume.

147
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,809
I'm going to talk
about the change in

148
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:13,689
entropy of this
control volume.

149
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,779
I I'm going to

150
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,859
basically what
I'm going to show

151
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,340
you is that just like
internal energy,

152
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,499
I can sum them, right?

153
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:23,059
So if I take
entropy change

154
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:24,699
here plus the
entropy change here,

155
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,939
that's the
entropy change of

156
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,459
the combined
control volumes.

157
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,060
And from that,
I'm going to link

158
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,300
this to the concept
of reversibility,

159
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,379
which until now, I kind of

160
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,579
said, trust me on it.

161
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,259
Like, this looks
reversible.

162
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,419
With this, I'm
going to give you

163
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,820
a firm a firm formula,

164
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,140
right, to stand on.

165
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,979
You're able to say,

166
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,379
no, that is
reversible or no,

167
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,740
that is irreversible.

168
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,579
Okay, um Great.

169
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:52,700
So entropy.

170
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,020
So we can write that ds.

171
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,419
So the variable for
entropy is S, okay?

172
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,619
I'm going to write
the units of

173
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:09,059
capital S is equal

174
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:10,419
to what does
this equal to?

175
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,060
This is kilojoules
per Kelvin.

176
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,979
If I write it as maybe

177
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,619
I'll give it some
fancy things

178
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:18,259
to make it big.

179
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,699
If I write little S,

180
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,180
little S is equal to

181
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,809
kilojoules per kilogram
per kelvin, okay?

182
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,649
So that's the units
then of it, right?

183
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:30,810
So this is the intensive

184
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,049
property, like, you know,

185
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,009
we have the capital
U internal energy,

186
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,929
little U, specific
internal energy.

187
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,369
It's the same thing
here, entropy

188
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,849
and specific
entropy, right?

189
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,169
This is equal to, right?

190
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:48,129
This is equal to Delta
Q divided by T, okay?

191
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:51,289
So changes in entropy are

192
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,569
related to heat, right?

193
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,569
So if I bring heat in
or out of something,

194
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,769
I'm going to be
increasing or

195
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,569
decreasing the entropy
of that system, okay?

196
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,489
This is the first thing

197
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,649
you should remember, okay?

198
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,449
All right. That's the
first thing statement.

199
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:13,049
The second one, I
had said verbally,

200
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,289
but we can write it
out loud, right?

201
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,209
I can say that the
total change in

202
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,129
entropy of

203
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:20,169
the combined control
volumes is equal to

204
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:21,809
the change in
the entropy of

205
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,929
control volume
plus the change in

206
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:28,209
entropy of control
volume two, okay?

207
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:31,769
So let's focus first
on control volume one.

208
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,889
All right.

209
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,369
We can write our um

210
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,499
So when we look at
this as it's drawn,

211
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,219
I only have heat
leaving, right?

212
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:51,020
Basically heat
leaving the system.

213
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,259
So my cue out.

214
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:59,179
So again, this is for
say, CV one, okay?

215
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,919
My Q out of,

216
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,239
let's say, one is just

217
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,639
equal to the Q that I've
defined here, right?

218
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,079
So I'm saying
this Q is here,

219
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,999
and I don't have
any Q in, right?

220
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:19,159
So my Q in for
control volume one is

221
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,919
equal to zero, okay?

222
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,559
And we assume, right,

223
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:29,880
because we assume thermal

224
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,350
reservoir Because of that,

225
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,030
the temperature T one

226
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,070
is equal to a
constant, right?

227
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,650
If I take our formula
there, right?

228
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,089
I can then write
the integral of ds,

229
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:53,890
let's say from
state one to state

230
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,570
two is equal to
the integral of

231
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:06,410
dq divided by let's
say T one, okay.

232
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,249
And we can denote

233
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,690
I'd like to
denote that this

234
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,650
applies for CV one, right?

235
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,650
So this is applied to
CV one there, right?

236
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,850
Because this
is a constant,

237
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,289
you can take the
T one out, right?

238
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,530
So essentially what you're

239
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,969
going to be left with
just for completeness,

240
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:24,169
I'll write it out, right?

241
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:25,730
You know, the
integral then,

242
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,090
uh uh of dq,

243
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,330
which then is going to
basically Q divided

244
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,410
by T one there, right?

245
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,340
Hmm. Okay.

246
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,060
Um, I've noticed something

247
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,540
here that I would
like to correct.

248
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,060
So here, right?

249
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,820
I'm saying that this is,

250
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,780
I have a heap being

251
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,659
transferred of
a magnitude Q

252
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,300
from control volume one to

253
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,619
control volume two.
That's the magnitude.

254
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,380
What I wrote here
is that the Q

255
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,660
out of this is equal to Q.

256
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,780
Because this is
leaving, right?

257
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,460
Here, I'll have to, like,

258
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,260
say that this is
somehow I'll have

259
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,380
to give this basically
a sign, okay?

260
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,910
Um, Unlike what I was
doing before, right,

261
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,910
when I went with the
Q and the Q out here,

262
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,550
I have to say if the heat

263
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,270
is leaving this, right?

264
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,990
It's a negative. If
it's entering in,

265
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,390
it's then a
positive, okay?

266
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,350
So maybe for now, what
I'll write is Q out.

267
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,750
All right. And I'll
call that a CV one.

268
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,750
And then if I make
the substitution,

269
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,790
what this would then
be is the negative Q

270
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,190
divided by Q one, okay?

271
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:46,779
And that is Delta S.
Um, where's my thing?

272
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,620
I have Delta S one, okay?

273
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,220
So we got one
formula, right?

274
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,900
And what does
that mean before

275
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,100
I get to the
second one, right?

276
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,580
So if I'm taking heat
and I'm cooling, right?

277
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,739
Basically, I'm cooling

278
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,900
off control volume one.

279
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,380
I'm taking the heat out,

280
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,379
and I'm reducing
the entropy,

281
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:05,779
okay? That's important.

282
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,179
So if I'm taking
something and

283
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,620
I'm transferring
heat out of it,

284
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,340
in that part that's
being cooled there,

285
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,380
the entropy is
being reduced.

286
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,460
One. But we're still

287
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,100
transferring heat into
something else, right?

288
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,419
To analyze this,
we'll have

289
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,860
to do the next part.

290
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,374
All right.

291
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,729
Oops.

292
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,770
All right,

293
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,130
what's easiest here?

294
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,210
I'm looking at the board,

295
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,130
how much space I got.

296
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,649
Let's swap this.
Let's do it the other

297
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,730
way. Let's do
it like that.

298
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,050
Okay, so now we can
look at CV two.

299
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,010
So let's look at
control volume two.

300
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,569
CV two are Q

301
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:12,410
in of um of two is just
equal to Q, right?

302
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,050
So we're transferring
heat in that's

303
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,210
positive and into there,

304
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,570
and we have no Q out.

305
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,970
So our Q out
when it comes to

306
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,489
control volume two
is equal to zero.

307
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:26,050
Again, we're going to

308
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,010
treat we're going to
assume that the one

309
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,769
on the right that behaves

310
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,009
like a thermal reservoir.

311
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,090
And so what that
means is that T two

312
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,090
is equal to a
constant, right?

313
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,210
So that doesn't vary.

314
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,170
We'll do the same thing.

315
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:47,440
So if I apply this now
for CV two, All right.

316
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,480
They'll have this
integral from state

317
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,840
one to state two of ds,

318
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,360
and that's equal
to the integral of

319
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,240
dq divided by T two.

320
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
This T two can come out of

321
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,480
the integral because
it's a constant.

322
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,279
So I have one over T
two integral of Q.

323
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,920
And what this is
then going to be

324
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,160
is one over T two

325
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,040
times in for two,

326
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
which if we do
that substitution,

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,920
this is nothing but Q
divided by T two, okay?

328
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,044
So this is Delta
S two, right?

329
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,170
So there's a
second formula.

330
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,450
And all we're
going to do, okay,

331
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,570
so let's first reflect

332
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,809
on this before we
bring it together.

333
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:37,970
So here, right, I

334
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,370
have heat being
transferred in.

335
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,890
This is positive.

336
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,009
The temperature
is a constant.

337
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:45,530
This entropy will
increase, all right?

338
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,050
So this will
increase. And now

339
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,730
we're just going to
substitute here.

340
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,410
So I'll put it into
the right hand side.

341
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,690
So this is what?

342
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,770
This is nothing
but negative Q

343
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,395
divided by T one.

344
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:06,260
Plus Q divided by two.

345
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,020
I can sort this. I can

346
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,899
then just write Q times

347
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:18,380
1/2 minus one over
T one is Delta S.

348
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,480
Okay, so what do we do?

349
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,079
What is the
change in entropy

350
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,760
of each body?
There is this.

351
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,520
So body one decreases
by that amount.

352
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,120
By two increases
by this amount.

353
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,840
What is the change in
entropy of the system?

354
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,640
It is this, okay?

355
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,599
And is this process
reversible?

356
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:47,800
So for a process to be

357
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,520
reversible, what
do you think?

358
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,480
How would you describe
a reversible process?

359
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,239
For those who have

360
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,679
definitely done
reading, yes, please.

361
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,449
What was that last
part? The same entropy.

362
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,690
So I'm going to
build on that.

363
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,210
If the entropy does

364
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,730
not change during
the process,

365
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,970
okay, that is going

366
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,450
to be a reversible
process here,

367
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,250
for the purposes
of this analysis.

368
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,370
So if the entropy
doesn't change here,

369
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,050
it's going to
be reversible.

370
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,940
What do we think
about this?

371
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,820
Do we think that Delta S

372
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
is going to be zero or no?

373
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,740
Or what would it take
for Delta S to be zero?

374
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,380
What would you have to
have, Cody? T. Yeah.

375
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,220
T two equals to T

376
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,899
one implies
Delta S is zero.

377
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,180
What would that imply for

378
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,420
this system in
this experiment?

379
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,780
So if I had the
same temperatures,

380
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,500
what would happen here

381
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,660
or what wouldn't
happen here?

382
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,780
No heat transfer, right?

383
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,300
So when I have
that, there's

384
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,980
no heat transfer, okay?

385
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,980
If I'm going to
have heat transfer,

386
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,180
my entropy is going
to change, right?

387
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,300
So that's the first thing.

388
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,820
Now, the second
thing is that,

389
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,059
is this a positive

390
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:09,340
or is this a
negative value?

391
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,260
And?

392
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,259
Yes, please.

393
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,660
I like that. It sounds

394
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,380
like a smart
person said it.

395
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,460
Okay, good. Yes.
So this term here,

396
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,500
if T two is higher, right?

397
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,539
So this is the
higher temperature,

398
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:33,820
one over that is going to

399
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,140
be a lower number, right?

400
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,660
If I then, this is on
the colder side, sorry.

401
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,980
I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry.

402
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,635
Hold on.

403
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:41,210
He.

404
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,890
I got to write
hot and cold.

405
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,050
This is like my
problem. You get

406
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,250
up here and
mistakes happen.

407
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,210
I don't know how.
Maybe it's entropy.

408
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,010
Alright, so, right?

409
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,890
So this is basically
going to be

410
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,170
a smaller term T one
is going to be higher.

411
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,009
So your negative term

412
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:55,970
is going to be
smaller because

413
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,289
it's a higher temperature

414
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,370
than this one, okay?

415
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,330
So the take home
message is that Delta S

416
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,449
is either zero in

417
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,730
this problem when
nothing happens,

418
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,969
or it increases when

419
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:12,169
you actually allow
heat to flow, okay?

420
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,440
Delta S can be
negative, right?

421
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,919
For a specific control
volume, right?

422
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:21,959
Control volume one,

423
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,919
Delta S definitely
decreased.

424
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,080
But if I look at the
whole system and I

425
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,159
gather the sum of all

426
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:29,259
of the parts and
I add it up,

427
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:32,079
If it's equal to zero,
right, reversible,

428
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,760
which sure means
no heat transfer,

429
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,720
or it increases.

430
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,839
And be very,
very skeptical

431
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,639
in your analysis
if you end

432
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:41,920
up with Delta acids

433
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,720
in a process being
negative, right?

434
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,839
It means on their own
for that whole system,

435
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,359
it will not happen
spontaneously, okay?

436
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,519
Right? And that was, like,

437
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,719
a major achievement in

438
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,519
thermodynamics is
like the prediction

439
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,279
of things happening
spontaneously,

440
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,439
right? This can
tell you that.

441
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:59,160
It can either tell you
if it's BS or if it

442
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,479
won't happen
spontaneously, okay? Good?

443
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:05,399
It's not that hard, right?

444
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:07,279
Or it's very hard.

445
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,639
Okay. Um, Yes.

446
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:12,999
Alright, so
this is, again,

447
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,600
some fou for thought
and you'll get

448
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,800
some practice with this
and get to use it.

449
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,919
And at some
point you become

450
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,719
comfortable kind
of comfortable,

451
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,839
or you'll accept it.

452
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,959
So entropies are
entropy, you know,

453
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,359
again, just like, you
know, when we did

454
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,319
internal energy, it's
a property, okay?

455
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,679
So if you determine
the state,

456
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,919
if you know, you know,

457
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,719
the two independent
properties or

458
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,079
parameters of

459
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,200
a pure substance,

460
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,559
you have complete
information.

461
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,320
So just like I

462
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,720
could determine
internal energy,

463
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,440
enthalpy specific volume,

464
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,599
you can also determine
entropy, right?

465
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,150
What I'm showing you
here is not super

466
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,910
helpful if you're
doing like Pie Killer.

467
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,989
These are like little, you

468
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,229
know, tricks that
if you were,

469
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:56,350
you know, old
school and doing,

470
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:56,669
you know,

471
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,949
tables, you can see
things like this.

472
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,909
But in the book, when
you look it up, again,

473
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:05,589
just like with the
other ones, right?

474
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,070
If you're having
notations,

475
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,310
when it's like F, right,

476
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,229
that's like a liquid,
when it's a G,

477
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:13,109
right, then it's
rid of saturated,

478
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,430
you know, vapor
that are with it.

479
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,949
But the take home
message out of

480
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,969
this is that you
can you know,

481
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,209
with all the
other parameters

482
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:20,809
that you would determine,

483
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,530
you can also
determine entropy,

484
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,970
and you will
also, you know,

485
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,330
produce a lot of diagrams.

486
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,489
So you will
produce what are

487
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:30,050
called TS
temperature entropy.

488
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,489
Diagrams are
very important

489
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:32,729
when you're
analyzing, again,

490
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:37,689
power cycles, gas
cycles, there, okay?

491
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:40,169
And it's not a path
function, right?

492
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:41,810
So if you like,
come up with

493
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,969
a difference in
the entropy,

494
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:43,889
it's just a
difference, right?

495
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:45,330
You don't have to
worry. Like, you

496
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,530
have that, you have
the properties.

497
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,449
All the formulas
are very valid and

498
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:51,954
compute can compute
there, okay?

499
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:54,939
Cool. So I did one
kind of intro example.

500
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,299
I'm going to go
through another one

501
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:57,579
now to show you
a little bit on

502
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:58,939
that property
determination to

503
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,459
convince you that
that's possible.

504
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,019
Now, are there any
questions before

505
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,379
I dive into that?
Is this clear?

506
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,059
All right. Maybe
another way,

507
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,139
if you wanted to look at

508
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,139
this before I dive in,

509
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,779
is to reflect on the
fact that, right,

510
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,260
these change in entropy

511
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,459
are like the dc
by T, right?

512
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,060
So if you're
transferring heat

513
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,940
in from a reservoir that's

514
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,269
at very high
temperature, right?

515
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:27,269
Like, it kind of

516
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,189
tells you that it
has a quality to it.

517
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:31,669
All right? So
this is, again,

518
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:33,590
the second part of the
second law, which is,

519
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,509
you know, energy is

520
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:36,749
conserved as
the first law.

521
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:38,549
Energy has, like, a value

522
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,029
to it is the second law.

523
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,909
And so looking at a
formula like that is

524
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,509
one way to start
to think about it.

525
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,829
All right.

526
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,509
You all know that
there's like

527
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:48,869
a review session
today at four, right?

528
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:50,509
Dechry Hall? Yes, please.

529
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:55,669
So you? What Delta T.

530
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,315
The Delta T that
I just erased.

531
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:02,000
For the rate of entropy.

532
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,599
So I'm sorry, dq
over T, okay?

533
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,399
So this T, and this is

534
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,279
what we're going
to get into in

535
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,960
some of the
other examples.

536
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,519
When I take control
volume one is

537
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,839
the temperature of

538
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,399
this control volume
here, right?

539
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,919
So when I'm looking
at the change

540
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,439
in entropy, I'm
saying, okay,

541
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:24,640
how much heat, am I
transferring out of that,

542
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
and then what's that
temperature there?

543
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,239
And there will be cases

544
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,280
where things don't
behave as a reservoir.

545
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,600
Again, the last
problem we're going to

546
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,840
do today is going
to be illuminating

547
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
because you can
have cases where I

548
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,320
transfer heat
out of something

549
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,550
and the temperature
changes.

550
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,819
All right. And
that's going to have

551
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:38,140
an effect then
on this formula.

552
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,380
So you're going to
have to integrate.

553
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,940
You're going to
write Q essentially

554
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,499
as like MCP Delta T.

555
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:44,099
You're going to be able
to integrate that and

556
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,780
it's going to be
a natural log.

557
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,340
Now give it away.

558
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,099
You can go home
now. All right.

559
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:54,539
Cool. Other questions?
Good question.

560
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,180
I don't know if this red

561
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,339
is really an erasable.

562
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,339
That's pretty okay.

563
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,519
Do damn.

564
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,080
All right. So calculate

565
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,679
the entropy changes that

566
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,640
calculate the
entropy changes,

567
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,960
entropy change that takes

568
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,079
place during processes
for pure substances.

569
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,159
All right. So in
this problem, we're

570
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,399
shown here a TS diagram.

571
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,479
For water here, okay?

572
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,959
And what we're told
is in this problem,

573
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,759
we have a piston
cylinder device at

574
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,600
some initial pressure

575
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,319
and some initial
temperature,

576
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,039
that there's a mass of

577
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,959
water contained in there

578
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:15,679
and that we're going to

579
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,879
transfer heat
into it, right?

580
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,160
And based on how I look at

581
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,999
it and also how
it's drawn there,

582
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,399
this is an
isobaric process,

583
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,920
so constant pressure.

584
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,399
What's shown in the
diagram here is that

585
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:28,799
we're starting off because

586
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,399
it's a dome to the left,

587
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:31,439
let me ask you this

588
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,719
what state do you
think one is?

589
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,359
I told you what dQ

590
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,159
by T is when it comes
to changes in entropy.

591
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,120
So what would you
expect the phase

592
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,399
of something with
low entropy to be?

593
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:45,759
What did you say?

594
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,479
Art? Comps liquid.

595
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:49,839
Comssed liquid.
Yes, right?

596
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,279
Okay, so if I put a
lot of heat into it,

597
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,480
right, you're going
to end up with

598
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,719
something that will not.

599
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,439
So then it turns out
that at state two,

600
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:57,959
right, you'd pass through,

601
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,359
constant temperature.

602
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,239
You could infer
from that that,

603
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,439
that's a liquid vapor
region and then

604
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:09,039
into the superheated
vapor. Okay?

605
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,639
Yeah, so some facts
our P P one here.

606
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:13,879
So we're gonna
go with state.

607
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:16,400
This is a horrible marker.

608
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,119
I have more? State.

609
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,720
There we go.
That's better.

610
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,999
State one. Okay.
State one.

611
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,399
All right, so State one,

612
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:33,639
we have a P one,

613
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:43,200
which is equal to 100
and 140 kpa 140 pa,

614
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,640
and a one that's equal
to 20 degrees Celsius.

615
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
And we could double
check ourselves,

616
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,839
but based on how
that is, it appears

617
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,039
right in that
liquid region,

618
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:53,999
that's complete
information,

619
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:54,839
and you would know

620
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:57,079
about you'd
know everything

621
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,679
about that state, right?

622
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,399
You'd know U one. You
know, you'd know V one.

623
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,800
You'd also know S one.

624
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,239
Remember and
that's little S

625
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,600
that's kilojoules

626
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,639
per kilogram per
kelvin, right?

627
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,809
Cool. Do do do.

628
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,769
And if you did, what I
can tell you is that

629
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:21,409
the S one is equal to

630
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:31,009
0.296 kilojoules per
kilogram Kelvin.

631
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,409
If you want it
just for fun,

632
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,210
we could also write
the enthalpy,

633
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:42,130
which is 84 kilojoules
per kilogram.

634
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,979
Great. All right,

635
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:48,539
can draw our piston
cylinder device,

636
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,259
start to do some
analysis of this,

637
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,500
some energy flow, and then

638
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,739
try to figure
out state two.

639
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:55,019
A, so I have this
piston cylinder.

640
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,339
I'm putting Q in.

641
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,860
Here's my control volume.

642
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,339
All right. Oh, and how
I got this, right?

643
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:03,460
This is Pi killer.

644
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,820
So if you click
on that link,

645
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,699
you can go through
and see how

646
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,739
that property
determination is done.

647
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:10,299
Alright, so we have this.

648
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,619
So I can say,

649
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,260
right, so the
mass is constant.

650
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,339
So we have the mass
that's inside of here,

651
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,419
which is equal to 1.5
kilograms, right?

652
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:18,939
So no mass in or out.

653
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:23,029
Um, The change in

654
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:27,789
the energy of the
control volume here,

655
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:31,709
it is equal to E
in minus R E out.

656
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,229
The way that energy
can change in

657
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:34,910
that, right,
internal energy,

658
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,829
kinetic energy plus

659
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:42,109
potential energy
is an equal

660
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:52,429
to Q in plus W in
Q out plus W out.

661
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:56,630
What do we
assume we assume

662
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:06,839
neglect KE and PE, right?

663
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:11,399
And we don't have
any work in,

664
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:13,359
and we don't have
any heat out, right?

665
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,799
So what this
implies, right,

666
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,719
is that Delta U
is equal to what?

667
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:25,959
Q in, which we
know minus W out.

668
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,759
What's W out here,

669
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,249
right? PDB, yes, right?

670
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:40,490
So this is the integral
of pressure volume.

671
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,889
It's constant
pressure, right?

672
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,489
So this would come out,

673
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:46,810
right, the integral of

674
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,929
dv from state one to two,

675
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:51,009
and this would
then just be

676
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:53,369
equal to P times V

677
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:59,329
two minus V
one. All right.

678
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,749
This is V. We could also

679
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,789
write this as
little V, right?

680
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,670
I could go mass, pressure,

681
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,989
little V two minus
little V one,

682
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:12,589
right, is equal
to the W out.

683
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:21,329
All right. So we can
rewrite that, right?

684
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:22,930
I can write and
I can rewrite

685
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,329
the two minus little
U one, right?

686
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:28,770
So that's the change
in the internal

687
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,209
energy is equal to my Q

688
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:35,970
in minus pressure
times the mass,

689
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,609
specific volume two

690
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,369
minus specific volume one.

691
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:43,049
All right. You can move

692
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:46,569
this all to this side,
right? So I can go.

693
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:52,150
U two plus PV

694
00:28:52,150 --> 00:29:00,709
two minus U one
plus PV one,

695
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:06,509
and that's equal
to A. All right.

696
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:14,889
What is this? At state
two. What is this?

697
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,969
That's state one,
will be at state one.

698
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:23,009
And so then M times H

699
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:27,450
two minus H one
is equal to Qn.

700
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,369
Now we know Q
we know H one

701
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:31,649
because I told you so,
and we know the mass.

702
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,249
We don't know
H two, though.

703
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,890
So the purpose
of this exercise

704
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,329
is actually to
determine H two and

705
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:40,405
H two is equal to QN
divided by the mass.

706
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,199
Plus H one, okay?

707
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,920
And that makes sense,
right, because you'd

708
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,640
expect also if
a matting keyed

709
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,440
into something
that the enthalpy

710
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,360
at the second state would

711
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,479
be greater than
the first, right?

712
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:51,919
So that tracks, right?

713
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,119
And so if you do that and

714
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,600
you do the substitution,

715
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,279
what you're going to
see is that this H

716
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,519
two is equal to

717
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:06,000
2,510.7 kilojoules
per kilogram, right?

718
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,839
So now for state two,

719
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,509
What do we know about

720
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:16,589
the property at state two?

721
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:18,990
So we know H two,
H two we've got.

722
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,589
What else do we know
about state two?

723
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:22,189
Pressure Pressure, right?

724
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:23,469
So P two is there.

725
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:25,389
H two with P two is enough

726
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:27,469
to determine S two, right?

727
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:29,390
So if I have these
two properties,

728
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,910
it's enough to
determine entropy,

729
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,509
specific volume, so on
and so forth, right?

730
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:39,190
We need to determine
temperature.

731
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,990
So the T two from
this is equal to

732
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:51,389
300,382.4

733
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:57,469
degrees, degrees C?

734
00:30:57,469 --> 00:30:59,949
Is this right? Yeah,
it feels right.

735
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:03,230
Yes. Okay. So that's

736
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,549
that. And then
the entropy.

737
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:06,669
So the S two is equal to

738
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:15,589
6.78 kilojoules per
kilogram Kelvin, right?

739
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,749
And how do we determine
change in entropy?

740
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,390
So what do we know about

741
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,429
the entropy at state one?

742
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,519
State two. All right.

743
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:47,839
M, it's S two minus S one.

744
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,399
So our mass is
1.5 kilograms.

745
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,080
RS two was 6.78

746
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,239
kilojoules per
kilogram Kelvin

747
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:06,759
-0.296 kilojoules
per kilogram Kelvin.

748
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,439
And so I'd expect
something,

749
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:09,800
what, close to like nine,

750
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,000
ten, nine, 9.7 right?

751
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,319
Kilojoules per kelvin is

752
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:20,999
the change in entropy
of that process, okay?

753
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:23,119
So this is another way,

754
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,119
especially when
we do cycles,

755
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,399
that you're going
to be calculating

756
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,599
changes in entropy, right?

757
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,799
So the first one I
showed you before,

758
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,959
is I take something and

759
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,679
I transfer heat
into it, okay?

760
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,319
Or I let something
maybe get cooled.

761
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,439
I calculate the entropy

762
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,439
of the thing that's
being cooled,

763
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:40,759
of the thing that's
being heated.

764
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,199
I sum them up and I
get a total Delta S,

765
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,780
right? That's
one approach.

766
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,440
Right?

767
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,559
You'll classify that in

768
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,919
problems when you
get with this.

769
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,679
The second way
that you'll see,

770
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:51,680
and this is especially

771
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,599
pertinent when
we think about

772
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:54,159
cycles is you're
just going

773
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,959
to look for
properties, right?

774
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,239
State one, state
two. I know that.

775
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,079
And the change in
entropy is going

776
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,039
to be nothing
but the M times

777
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,519
that Delta S or

778
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,039
the dot times that
Delta S, okay?

779
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,439
All right. And
if it's zero

780
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:15,720
for a process like
that, it's isentropic.

781
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,439
If that's like a work
transfer process,

782
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,279
that means that it's
basically reversible,

783
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,839
all right? Okay.

784
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:25,349
Any questions about
that? All right.

785
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:27,429
Maybe just to illustrate
what that looks

786
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:30,910
like in the
actual notebook.

787
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,069
Oop, let's skip
verification.

788
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:34,629
Live dangerously.

789
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:36,429
All right.

790
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:46,749
Authorize do do do.

791
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:04,089
All right. So all
that you see, right?

792
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:06,339
So I can define a
state here like that.

793
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:09,989
Water underscore one
dot S. That's it.

794
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,389
So we bothered with

795
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,789
this whole
business of, like,

796
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,310
two independent variables

797
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,510
determining properties,

798
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,509
all the other properties
for this reason.

799
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:18,910
We made all of
that effort,

800
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,629
especially on

801
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:21,069
the programming side
because it's going

802
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:23,469
to be like bordering
on trivial to,

803
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,829
like, compute these
things, right?

804
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,509
No interpolation,
no, like,

805
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:28,510
when I was your age,
it was suffering.

806
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,109
I mean, like, you know,

807
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,709
it was like, to do this.

808
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:34,549
This is so straightforward
and allows you to,

809
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:36,309
like, think about
more than that.

810
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:37,109
Like, you can look at

811
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:38,429
more difficult things
and do it, right?

812
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,869
So this hopefully
helps you

813
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,549
to appreciate that, right?

814
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,609
Just dots and you
have it, okay?

815
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:46,989
Good. Sweet. All right.

816
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,429
Good. So your turn.

817
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,670
So take this 5
minutes, a neighbor.

818
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,029
Let's see how much of
this you absorbed if

819
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:58,190
your entropy was zero
or if it increased.

820
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,869
All right?

821
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,509
And if you don't,

822
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:03,710
then we'll talk
through it, alright?

823
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,190
I'll circulate if
you have questions.
