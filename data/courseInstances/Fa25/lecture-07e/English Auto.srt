1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
All right, I got 210.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,240
I'm going to get started.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,680
Two. So today,
we're going to

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,840
continue with
entropy analysis.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,400
Before I get into that, I

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,640
just want to make
a note, right?

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,080
So this class is right,

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,240
it's a lower division.

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,399
It's core subject there,

10
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:18,919
which is

11
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,039
kind of a euphemism
for application light.

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,479
Like we don't get too much

13
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:24,519
into applications
right there.

14
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,879
In the spring, though,

15
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,879
I'm going to be teaching

16
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,950
a class and on
data center,

17
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,429
basically energy
management in

18
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:32,629
large scale systems,

19
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:34,950
which at the moment
means data centers.

20
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,069
So I'm not going to
read through it.

21
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,669
It's all there, but
the take home is,

22
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:41,390
you know, one third
thermodynamics

23
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,429
fluid mechanics
heat transfer.

24
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:45,909
No requisite knowledge
on that coming in.

25
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:47,590
Next third is essentially

26
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,989
implementation there,

27
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,109
and then the
final third is

28
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:52,390
solving problems,
use inspired cases.

29
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,659
We'll have guest lectures
from, um, you know,

30
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:57,100
computational flu dynamics

31
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,339
experts at good companies,

32
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:00,499
cadence Nvidia,
vert, and related.

33
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:02,299
So if that sounds
nice, you know,

34
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,579
you're welcome to join.

35
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:04,859
We'd love to
have you, right?

36
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,499
Okay, so after today,

37
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,100
you should be
able to analyze

38
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,339
reversible steady
flow work and

39
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,979
the important parameters
and then be able to

40
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,379
discuss the best
performance for

41
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,420
various adiabatic
steady flow devices.

42
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,700
So we'll look at turbine,

43
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,939
and if there's
time today, we'll

44
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:20,260
look at the nozzle.

45
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,819
And in your homework,
you're going to

46
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,339
be doing a I'm sorry,

47
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:25,220
we'll be doing turbine
and compressor,

48
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,979
and then you'll also have

49
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,899
that in your
homework, okay?

50
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:28,659
But first,

51
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,739
let's finish the problem

52
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:30,619
that we started last time.

53
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:31,619
So last time we were

54
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,980
analyzing a
heat exchanger.

55
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,739
So we were looking at

56
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:38,619
a hot water and

57
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,819
cold water that were
coming together.

58
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,299
So we had a cold
water stream

59
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,379
coming in with a
mass flow rate here,

60
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,819
ten degrees C and with
some mass flow rate.

61
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,339
It was exiting
at 70 degrees C,

62
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,419
and then hot water,

63
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:54,419
which was coming in
at 85 degrees C and

64
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:58,260
a mass flow rate
and an unknown.

65
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,859
And what we did
is we first

66
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,775
applied right we did
a control volume

67
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:04,689
or on the cold on

68
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,530
the cold water stream,
right, which was here.

69
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,730
Okay. And because we knew

70
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,730
the incoming and the
exiting properties

71
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,929
and the mass flow rate,

72
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,890
we were able to
determine how much heat

73
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,730
was being
transferred into it.

74
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,370
So we knew the q.in.

75
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,330
With that information,
the mass flow rate

76
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,049
of this and the
temperature

77
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:26,250
of the incoming stream,

78
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,050
we were able to determine
the enthalpy and

79
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,060
the temperature of the
exiting stream, okay?

80
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,540
And so from this, we had

81
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,579
complete knowledge
then about the states.

82
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,820
So essentially, we knew

83
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,340
state one, we
knew state two,

84
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,940
we knew state three, and

85
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,340
we knew state four, okay?

86
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,420
And where we stopped
was in the analysis of

87
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,459
the rate of
entropy generation

88
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:51,140
inside of the heat
exchanger, okay?

89
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,779
So to do this part
of it, right?

90
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,820
So remember, for this,

91
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,940
I said to break it down.

92
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,540
Single fluid stream, dry

93
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,534
your control volume
to your analysis.

94
00:02:58,534 --> 00:03:00,050
Figure out your states.

95
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,570
When you do entropy
generation problems,

96
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,690
you're going to
then combine

97
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,050
all these control
volumes, right?

98
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,290
So if I call this,
I don't know,

99
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,410
control volume one, and

100
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,529
then maybe the dash one is

101
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:11,730
control volume two.

102
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,609
When we do the
entropy analysis,

103
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:16,730
we're going to do it
for all of them, okay?

104
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,929
So I'm basically
just going to draw

105
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:24,810
the red dashed line
around that, okay?

106
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,930
And just like with
the energy balance,

107
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,130
all right, we
can say, right,

108
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,930
that the rate of change of

109
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,510
entropy in

110
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,630
this control volume,
which I will call,

111
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,909
you know, maybe I'll
call this, you know,

112
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:41,870
one plus two, so
the red one here.

113
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,389
Is equal to the rate
that entropy enters

114
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,229
minus the rate
that it exits

115
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,429
plus the rate that it's
generated, all right?

116
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:55,390
The one really key
conceptual difference

117
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,229
in this analysis
compared to energy,

118
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,750
is that one entropy,

119
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,070
right,

120
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,950
for the entire system
that we look at there,

121
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,310
the combined one, it
can either be zero

122
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,470
or it can right,
it can increase.

123
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,110
And as a result
of that, right,

124
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,910
we have this gen term,

125
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,750
which is due to

126
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,429
essentially
irreversibilities,

127
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:16,070
right, as we talked
about, okay?

128
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,110
So if you assume
steady flow, right?

129
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,340
So if you have a steady
flow device, device.

130
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,780
Okay, this term is
going to go to zero.

131
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,380
And so S dot gen
is going to be

132
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,459
equal to the rate
that entropy enters.

133
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,259
I'm sorry.

134
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,179
S dot gen is going
to be equal to

135
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:37,340
the rate that
entropy leaves,

136
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,659
so dot out minus
s.in, right?

137
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,419
So if we call this one,

138
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,299
so this is a mass
flow rate coming in,

139
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,899
let's say it's M dot cold.

140
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,580
And then this is
the mass flow rate,

141
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,300
let's say M dot hot hot.

142
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,219
Oh, my God.
That's a new one.

143
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:58,059
So which fluid streams

144
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:59,299
are leaving the
heat exchanger?

145
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,459
Which states are
at the exit of

146
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,300
the seed exchanger?

147
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,219
There's two.
What are they?

148
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,339
I know the loss

149
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,660
didn't feel very
good this weekend.

150
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,619
Okay, so it's the
even numbers, right?

151
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,779
So we have the entropy
that's leaving, right,

152
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:21,099
which is, we'll write
a little S two, okay?

153
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,659
And we'll have a little

154
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:26,039
S four, which
is here, okay?

155
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,100
Now, we need to multiply

156
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,699
this by its mass
flow rate, right?

157
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,099
So the S dot out

158
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,619
from the cold water stream

159
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:33,299
then is going to be

160
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,420
your dot let's say dot

161
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,379
cold cold, which is there.

162
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,379
And for the SDOT
or this case here,

163
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,739
then is going to be
the MDOT hot, okay?

164
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:48,019
And so that's your
SDOT out, all right?

165
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:51,420
Now, this is
minus the rate

166
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,859
of entropy
that's entering.

167
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,579
Now this is entering

168
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,219
then being carried in

169
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,219
with the fluid at state
one and state three.

170
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:02,419
So the MDT cold should
be multiplied by what?

171
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:09,279
S? One. Thank
you. All right.

172
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:16,039
And then this is plus
m dot hot times what?

173
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,399
Three, right? S three.

174
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,519
And so you can
rearrange this.

175
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,720
If you rearrange this, we

176
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,840
can write this
as a function of

177
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,320
the we can pull out
the mass flow rate.

178
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,119
So we can have dot,
let's say, cold,

179
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,799
and that could be times S

180
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:35,399
two or little S two
minus little S one,

181
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,639
it's S two minus S one,

182
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,320
and that could be
times M dot hot

183
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,279
times the leading term

184
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,359
there should be
S four, okay?

185
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:49,239
And that's four
minus S three, okay?

186
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:53,840
And that's the rate of
entropy generation.

187
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,059
Let's see if I have
some numbers to this.

188
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,659
First of all, let

189
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:03,939
me make sure I
did it right.

190
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,700
I'm not cold. I'm not hot.

191
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,139
Yes, that looks correct.

192
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,099
Mm hmm. Yeah, so if you

193
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,540
substituted in
the properties

194
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,459
that we continue there,

195
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:20,699
so the dot gen big
dot gen is an equal

196
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:28,139
to 0.063 kilowatts
per kelvin, okay?

197
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,629
Um Yeah,

198
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,789
and why are we able
to determine this?

199
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,709
Because if you look at dot

200
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,190
or basically your
S parameters,

201
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,669
see, these are
properties, okay?

202
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:45,589
And we were able to
determine, right,

203
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,429
the properties of
the fluid into

204
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:48,829
the analysis at the end

205
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,229
of the last
lecture, right?

206
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:50,909
So these are things that

207
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,669
you just like look up.

208
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:52,589
You know, as a function of

209
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,269
the fluid chain
that's coming in.

210
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:56,189
So, that's the substance,

211
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:56,909
and then let's say

212
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,550
the pressure and
the temperature.

213
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,870
Or in this case, we
analyze the enthalpy.

214
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,669
So we need the
pressure the enthalpy,

215
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:06,230
and you'll be able
to get that, right?

216
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,109
So you have it,

217
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:09,029
you substitution
and you get it.

218
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,990
Um If you want to

219
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,309
reflect on this,
as I said before,

220
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,589
so for this process,

221
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,389
the generation
can either be

222
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,269
zero or it can be a
positive value, right?

223
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,669
Because essentially
you have

224
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,270
within even if this
device is adiabatic,

225
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,629
so even if no
heat transfer

226
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:26,589
is coming in
from the outside

227
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,789
because there's heat being

228
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:29,949
exchanged between the cold

229
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:30,909
and the hot streams,

230
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,110
you'd have expectation of

231
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,230
a positive value, okay?

232
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,560
So start simple, right?

233
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,919
Do control volumes

234
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,520
for the individual
streams.

235
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,360
Good understanding then
of the states, okay?

236
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,519
Once you know that,
it's easy to go in

237
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
and then do the rate
of heat transfer.

238
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,879
And again, just applying

239
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,960
this analysis of the
entropy analysis

240
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,039
of a control volume.

241
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,360
You just draw it around
the entire device,

242
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,080
and then plug and chug.

243
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,719
It's pretty
straightforward, all right?

244
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:05,560
Questions? Great.
All right.

245
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,239
So there's not as usal,

246
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:07,840
you can click on

247
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,080
that link and follow
through if you have

248
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,840
questions when
you're doing

249
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,260
your homework
and all that.

250
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,680
All right, do do.

251
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,280
So reversible
steady flow work.

252
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,600
So what we'll do at this
stage is we're going

253
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,599
to continue to build on

254
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:28,560
that concept of
a process being,

255
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
you know, reversible and

256
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,999
adiabatic is isentropic,

257
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:32,800
and we're going to use

258
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,720
this to write maybe one of

259
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
the most famous equations

260
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,639
in fluid mechanics, right?

261
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,439
So this equation
we're going to

262
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,080
derive is called the
Bernoulli equation.

263
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,400
Daniel Bernoulli
was a Swiss guy,

264
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,079
came from a very
prominent family

265
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,000
of mathematicians
there, okay?

266
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,520
So And really what
the formula is

267
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,920
that will derive is that

268
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,040
essentially pressure

269
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,000
on a fluid causes
it to move.

270
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,680
Okay? So maybe
you knew that,

271
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,719
but ME 40 thermodynamics,

272
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,080
if you didn't, now,
you know it today.

273
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,480
All. Okay. Um do do.

274
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,560
Alright, so we can
start with the pipe.

275
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,599
So imagine we
have here a pipe.

276
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:25,120
Let's say we have
some state one at

277
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,879
the inlet and let's say

278
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,039
a state two at the exit.

279
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:37,519
We can draw a control
volume around the pipe.

280
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,920
We can do our conservation
equations, right?

281
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,040
So this is our control
volume, right?

282
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,800
The dm CV dt is equal to

283
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,159
m.in minus M
dot out, right?

284
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,919
So we have a single stream

285
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,080
in and a single
stream out.

286
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,680
And if we assume,

287
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,960
this is a steady
flow device.

288
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,720
Okay, right? This
is going to go out.

289
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,040
You write the
same thing for

290
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,440
our conservation
of energy, DE, CV,

291
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,639
dt, and it's equal to our

292
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,400
e.in minus our E dot out.

293
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,680
And for the same
reason, if it's

294
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,240
a steady flow device,

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,400
There's no change in

296
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,879
the energy of the
control volume,

297
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,639
which means that
that term also

298
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,040
goes to zero, right?

299
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
We can write our
e dot, right?

300
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,680
So our generalized e dot

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,200
could be a work power,

302
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,280
so W dot Q dot,

303
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,759
an dot times an enthalpy

304
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,400
of velocity squared
divided by two,

305
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,360
and then a G Z, right?

306
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,679
So this is the enthalpy.

307
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,480
So internal energy
plus flow work,

308
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,520
kinetic energy,
potential energy there.

309
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,400
Consequence of
this is that.in is

310
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,200
equal to M dot out
is equal to m dot.

311
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:08,160
Great. All right.

312
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,879
So we make

313
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,039
some further assumptions
assumptions.

314
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,560
So one of them
is that we have

315
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,280
an incompressible
fluid, Icopressible.

316
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,759
What's an example of an
incompressible fluid?

317
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,880
Water.

318
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,040
Okay, so water
is one example.

319
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,000
We're going to
assume, right,

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,520
adiabatic adiabatic
plus reversible.

321
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,559
Which implies
what? Isentropic.

322
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,999
Okay. So we have
an isentropic.

323
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:47,600
Right? So we have an
isentropic flow, right?

324
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,440
Do do. We're also

325
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,120
going to have
no shaft work.

326
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,040
So we have no
shaft work there.

327
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,799
And so if we write
our conservation

328
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,560
of energy equation,

329
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,520
we're going to
be able to say,

330
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,880
just to maybe come back
here and write it.

331
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,680
So if we say that
there's no work,

332
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,400
there's no heat transfer,

333
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,359
the MDOT in is
the MDOT out.

334
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,280
Essentially, it's just
going to be enthalp P

335
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,705
plus kinetic energy
plus potential energy.

336
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:18,490
The inlet is
equal to the same

337
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,490
at the outlet, right?

338
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,170
So you're going
to say that H

339
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,970
one plus velocity
one squared

340
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,890
divided by two plus
gz one is equal to H

341
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:37,570
two plus w squared divided
by two plus g two.

342
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:43,040
That's a two. All right.

343
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,120
Good. Mm hmm.

344
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,680
You recall the derivation

345
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,320
that we did
before where we

346
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,440
related changes
in entropy to

347
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
changes in enthalpy
and pressure.

348
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,360
So ds is equal to
dH minus V dp.

349
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,720
So TD little S,

350
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,439
d little H minus
little V dp and right,

351
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:12,680
so since V is equal to a,

352
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,580
um, is equal
to a constant.

353
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,340
We can integrate this.

354
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,419
So if we integrated
this, then here,

355
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,220
what we'd have is
then T times S

356
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,379
two minus S one
is equal to

357
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:39,540
H two minus H one minus
V P two minus P one.

358
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,699
It's isentropic
isentropic,

359
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:51,020
which implies
what that's it.

360
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,299
R S two is this one,

361
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:58,020
which in this case
implies that rate

362
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:04,580
h2h2 minus H one

363
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,700
is going to be equal
to the negative of

364
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,660
little V P two
minus P one.

365
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:34,970
Yes, please. H
two minus H one,

366
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,009
this should be a positive.

367
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:40,369
Thank you. Other feedback.

368
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,730
So just for on
the recording,

369
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,649
this should be a positive.

370
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,170
Okay. No.

371
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,490
Okay.

372
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,609
Yeah, so we can rearrange.

373
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:54,889
So if we rearrange

374
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,010
our original
formula that's

375
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,930
up there, maybe I'll
do it right here.

376
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,650
So if we rearrange
that to be

377
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,330
H two minus H one,

378
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,850
this would be W one
squared divided by

379
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,050
two plus G Z one
is equal to H

380
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,609
two minus H one plus

381
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:22,685
W two squared divided
by two plus G two.

382
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:26,440
Mm hmm. This, right?

383
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,160
We can do a
substitution to here.

384
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:38,160
And so that'll be V
P two minus P one,

385
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,520
and close to
our final form.

386
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,080
So if I can write this
as let's see here.

387
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,720
So I can do zero, right?

388
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,360
Zero is equal to

389
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,460
V P two minus P
one. All right.

390
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,500
We can do the W terms now.

391
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,019
So plus W looks like W two

392
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:15,059
squared minus W one
squared divided by two,

393
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:24,579
and then plus G Z
two minus Z one.

394
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:40,660
There newly equation.

395
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,089
Yeah, so this works.

396
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:52,449
So, what is this valid?

397
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:54,890
This is basically
valid for, right?

398
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,490
Incompressible fluids.

399
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:08,010
Like you mentioned,
water, no friction.

400
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,649
All right. And
no fun things

401
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:14,850
like shock waves.

402
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,289
All right. All right.

403
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:21,209
And the take home message,

404
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,409
all right, is
that you can do

405
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:23,649
things like, you know,

406
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:25,409
have trade offs between

407
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:28,409
pressures that
you apply, okay?

408
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,649
Which can cause
fluids to move,

409
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:33,170
right, to gain
kinetic energy.

410
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,849
And you can
also store that

411
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,289
as potential
energy, right?

412
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,850
So this could be,
like what we would

413
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,609
call as a
hydrostatic term,

414
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:42,769
something like a tall
column of liquid,

415
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:43,009
right?

416
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:43,649
There might be a lot

417
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:45,770
of pressure at
the base of that.

418
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,329
And if there
was no pressure

419
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,369
applied right across from,

420
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,769
let's say at the
top of the column,

421
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,289
right, you have
atmospheric pressure,

422
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,170
maybe at the bottom of
it also atmospheric,

423
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,849
and then you poke
a hole, right?

424
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:58,449
Right? Initially,
you start off with

425
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:00,249
no velocity at one
end of the pipe,

426
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,009
and at the other
one, you have

427
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,084
a very large one, okay?

428
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:06,080
So pressure on a fluid

429
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,639
causes it to
move, all right?

430
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,719
Icon incompsible,
no friction,

431
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,360
no shock waves, essentially,
isentropic flow.

432
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,640
All right? Questions?

433
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,519
You'll use it at M one
oh six. All right?

434
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,320
I think it's say you
already know it.

435
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,624
Good. Um let's see. Do do.

436
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:27,249
All right. So
moving along.

437
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,609
So now we can
continue with

438
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:32,530
this analysis
in isentropic

439
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,569
and apply it
towards devices.

440
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:37,649
If you remember before,
what I mentioned was

441
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:40,089
that we're going to

442
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:40,970
treat these devices as

443
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,369
isotropic to figure out,

444
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:43,649
in the case of
a compressor,

445
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,529
what's the minimum amount

446
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:45,529
of work I need to put in,

447
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,850
or in the case
of a turbine,

448
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,009
what's the
maximum amount of

449
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:49,729
work that I could get out?

450
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,489
And what we're
going to do today,

451
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:54,409
we'll start with
the turbine is to

452
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,929
account for a reality,
actual systems.

453
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,369
So actual systems have
friction and that,

454
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,569
and the way that this
is expressed is in

455
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,129
terms of isentropic
efficiencies, right?

456
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:06,450
So what's an isotropic

457
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,050
efficiency in the
case of a turbine?

458
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,449
It's the ratio
of the actual

459
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,089
turbine work that's done

460
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,890
normalized or divided by

461
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,930
the isentropic
turbine work, right?

462
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,889
Just to remind you

463
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,329
how these turbines
look like,

464
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:20,009
you have an
upstream condition

465
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:21,649
that's the same in
both, all right?

466
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:22,850
So you have a
pressure, let's

467
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,009
say that's coming
out of a boiler,

468
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:25,850
so superheated steam
at some pressure

469
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,850
and temperature that's

470
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,180
entering into
your turbine.

471
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,110
In the case of

472
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,269
a reversible
adiabatic turbine,

473
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,949
right, it's isotropic.

474
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,869
You're going to
be given, usually

475
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,469
the pressure
downstream, right?

476
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,309
And again, in a
rankin cycle,

477
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,469
that's going to be
what's inside of

478
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:42,190
the condenser, but
that's a given.

479
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,669
And in order to determine

480
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:45,429
the enthal P here
at this state,

481
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:47,269
you have to
assume something,

482
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:49,070
which in this case,
adiabatic reversible,

483
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,349
it's the same
entropy, right?

484
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,909
So S one here is
equal to S two,

485
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:53,109
and you can
analyze that and

486
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:54,349
then get the
denominator, right?

487
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:54,749
From that,

488
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:56,795
we essentially have
the denominator.

489
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:58,719
In this case,
again, you have

490
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,680
the same upstream,
the same pressure.

491
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,000
To analyze this, you'd

492
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,160
be given
inefficiency, right?

493
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,959
And the name of the
game is you use

494
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:08,519
this information to
determine enthalpy two.

495
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,039
You can also determine
the entropy,

496
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,320
but essentially,
you'll determine

497
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,159
the enthalpy
at this state.

498
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:15,319
And then with that,
you'll be able to say

499
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,559
how much power
you actually

500
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,000
get out of the device.

501
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,720
I'm presenting
this graphically.

502
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,039
So here you see a plot of

503
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,279
pressure enthalpy
for water, right?

504
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,319
So saturated liquid,
saturated vapor,

505
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,664
both starting at the
same initial state.

506
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:33,289
You see here the
move to two S,

507
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:36,729
and then here actually
two A, right?

508
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,689
So which one of those
produces more work?

509
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:41,609
One to two S or
one to two A?

510
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,929
What does the work of
a turbine depend on?

511
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,490
What is the formula
for a turbine?

512
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,449
W dot turbine is
equal to M dot

513
00:21:55,449 --> 00:22:02,940
times w. All right.

514
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,539
H one by H two.

515
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,059
Which of these has

516
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,379
the larger
difference between H

517
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,259
one and H two?

518
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,940
You don't have to
answer. It's rhetorical.

519
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,699
We'll do it in
this example

520
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,020
All right. So we'd
like to derive.

521
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,859
So the goal of this is
we're going to derive

522
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:10,339
derive isentropic
efficiency

523
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,339
of a turbine.

524
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:24,409
All right. And
the next thing

525
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:26,049
we're going to do is
we're going to be

526
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:31,530
given of a turbine.

527
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:39,890
So if it's an adiabatic
adiabatic turbine.

528
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,610
And if we're told that

529
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,009
P one is equal to three p,

530
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:55,130
and T one is equal to
350 degrees Celsius,

531
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:01,489
and P two is
equal to 75 and

532
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:10,810
pa with an isentropic
efficiency

533
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,530
of the turbine
equal to 0.9,

534
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:22,050
determine T to actual

535
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,450
and T two isentropic.

536
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,729
So in my notation here,

537
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:28,849
when I speak about
the downstream state,

538
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,410
so that's the state
two out of my turbine.

539
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,609
When I write S, this
is the isentropic,

540
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:36,050
and when I write A,
this means actual.

541
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,129
I think the book
does the same.

542
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,609
And then we'll show it on

543
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,009
a diagram. I'm
showing it there.

544
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:45,049
So you have pH
a pH diagram.

545
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:50,609
Okay. All right.

546
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,049
So our assumptions are
that we have, right,

547
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:54,569
control volume, right,

548
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:57,530
mass enters and
crosses the boundary.

549
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,010
We can't assume an ideal

550
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,569
gas because this is water.

551
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,489
Um, We're going to

552
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:03,850
neglect kinetic energy

553
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,250
and potential
energy effects.

554
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,690
It's an adiabatic process.

555
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,049
It's a steady
flow process,

556
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,769
and we have a
single inlet and

557
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,209
a single outlet, right?

558
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:14,929
So if we again,

559
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:18,169
if we write our w.in plus

560
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:23,930
q.in plus dot
plus w squared

561
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,969
divided by two
plus gz one is

562
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:30,690
equal to our w dot
out plus Q dot

563
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,729
out plus our.h2 plus

564
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:39,649
w squared divided
by two, gz two.

565
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:43,120
All right. Adiabatic,
right? So this is gone.

566
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,800
We don't have any
work transferring

567
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,080
because this is a turbine.

568
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,640
We don't have
significant changes

569
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,520
in kinetic and
potential energies.

570
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,639
And so our W dot
right out is nothing

571
00:25:54,639 --> 00:26:00,199
but dot times H
one minus H two.

572
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,559
Now, in this case,

573
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,320
where we know we now
determine our states.

574
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,959
So we're going to
talk about state one.

575
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,039
With state one,
I know P one,

576
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,599
and I know T one,

577
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,599
which means that
I know S one

578
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,439
and I know H one, okay?

579
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,739
Talk about state two
S. For state two S,

580
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:26,939
I know P two,

581
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:28,859
and I know that
little S two is

582
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,779
equal to little
S one, right?

583
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,179
And so it means that
I can determine h2s,

584
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,139
and I can determine TS,

585
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:36,819
and that's one of

586
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,579
the things we'd
like to know.

587
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:46,469
All right. That's great.

588
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:47,629
So we know the states.

589
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:49,829
Let's come back to
our formula here.

590
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:54,589
So we can define
a W dot out of

591
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:56,869
the isotropic system is

592
00:26:56,869 --> 00:27:01,829
the mass flow rate times
H one minus H twos.

593
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,589
We can also
define the power

594
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:08,630
out of the device
for the actual,

595
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:15,069
and that's dot H one
minus H two actual.

596
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,239
You see here
the definition

597
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,360
of the isentropic
efficiency,

598
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,560
which is given in
the problem as 0.9.

599
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,599
So the isentropic
efficiency is defined

600
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,589
as the power out

601
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:33,629
of the turbine for
the actual case,

602
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:38,190
divided by the power
out for the isentropic.

603
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,389
And this is going
to be a number

604
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:40,589
that's less than
one, right?

605
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:41,749
Because you can't
do better than

606
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:43,269
the isentropic case.

607
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,749
That's the
maximum power out

608
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:45,909
you're going to be
able to get out of

609
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:49,189
this adiabatic
turbine is W dot out

610
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:52,909
S. If W dot

611
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,910
out of the actual was
actually isentropic,

612
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,109
if it had an isentropic
effiency of one,

613
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:00,869
then they're
essentially the same.

614
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:02,310
So you can substitute

615
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,109
these two equations
that we have above.

616
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:06,669
And so you'll have M dot,

617
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,519
H one minus H two A

618
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:16,399
divided by m.h1 minus h2s.

619
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,359
The dots cancel,

620
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,879
and that's what
it's defined as.

621
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:24,000
The book calls this
an approximation.

622
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,880
Why is this an
approximation?

623
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,519
What approximation
do we make?

624
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,229
We neglected kinetic and

625
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:32,869
potential energy
changes, okay?

626
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:34,390
So here, that's
the assumption

627
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,710
that's implicit when
you write this.

628
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,270
So in the book,

629
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,709
you'll see sometimes
it's writing it

630
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:40,670
as like
approximately equal,

631
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,030
but this is what
you'll do, right?

632
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,470
So you have this defined,

633
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,150
and then you'll go to
a formula like that.

634
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,389
And the goal out of this

635
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,109
exercise is we know H one.

636
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,669
We know H twos, right?

637
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:52,169
Because we
determined it here.

638
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:53,910
And so what you're

639
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,549
trying to find from
this analysis in

640
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:56,909
the substitution
is actually

641
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:59,069
H two A, all right?

642
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:01,829
So again, you're
given upstream state.

643
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:02,589
You can determine

644
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:05,189
the isentropic
downstream state,

645
00:29:05,189 --> 00:29:07,949
and you're given
E to T, right?

646
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:09,949
So the isentropic
efficiency

647
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,150
the turbine is 0.9.

648
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,709
And so you solve
for H two A.

649
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,129
All right. And
by knowing that,

650
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:21,489
so now with state two,

651
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:24,729
so we can call
state two A,

652
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,129
by knowing that, we know P

653
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:27,729
two just as it was before,

654
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:30,209
and now we know H two A.

655
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:37,449
And with that, we can
determine then T two A,

656
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:41,490
which was one of the
asks out of the problem.

657
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,580
So we use Pi color.

658
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,139
I'm going to use
Pi color again,

659
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:49,059
define this state
here, I have TS.

660
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:51,139
Define that state
to have T two A.

661
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:55,139
And so the T I

662
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:59,939
have as our T start with
T two A. I have T A,

663
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:03,499
which is equal to o
no, I've printed now.

664
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:05,420
Oh, that's awesome.
I've printed

665
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,779
the same value twice.

666
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:12,379
Super good. I All right.

667
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,579
So this is anyways,

668
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,620
this would be
the analysis,

669
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,379
and then this is the way

670
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:16,299
that you'd get to it.

671
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:17,940
I'll update the
Jupyter Notebook

672
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,899
and post the link
to that there.

673
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:21,339
But again, just
to summarize,

674
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:22,980
the whole point of this
exercise is you're

675
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,179
going to be given
upstream state,

676
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:27,020
a downstream pressure,

677
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,859
an isotropic efficiency,

678
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:29,859
and you're going
to be asked to

679
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:31,139
determine things like
what is the work,

680
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:32,939
the power output
of the device.

681
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:34,260
You go to this formula,

682
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,659
solve for H twoA.

683
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,220
With the downstream
pressure,

684
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,739
you'll have complete
information, okay?

685
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:41,739
You could also
determine, because

686
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,820
once you have H twoA,

687
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,539
you could also determine,

688
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:46,020
right, the actual
power output

689
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,340
by then substituting

690
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,499
into that formula,
all right?

691
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,880
Okay. Cool.

692
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,360
Yeah. And so if you
look at this diagram,

693
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,799
so I've also used the

694
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,600
defined a process
for this.

695
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,479
So I define a state
one to state two,

696
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:06,879
and I use the
process class

697
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:09,919
of Pi Killor to
create a pH diagram.

698
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,279
And you'll see here
that for state two S,

699
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,679
the enthalpy is less
than that for two A,

700
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,039
right? So the
difference, right?

701
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,640
The difference in
the enthalpy between

702
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,319
H one and H twoS
is greater than

703
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,279
the difference of
H one and H two A.

704
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,679
And so what it
means, right,

705
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,479
is that one to two S

706
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,279
is going to produce
more power, right?

707
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,959
This value here
is going to be

708
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,519
larger than that
one, right?

709
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,439
So this would
be very easy,

710
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,040
and you would just
take that with you,

711
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,279
and I wouldn't have
to say more, but,

712
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,200
you know, because we

713
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,720
like to make things
interesting,

714
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,600
we'll talk about
now a compressor.

715
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,960
In the case of
a compressor,

716
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,879
it is not the ratio of

717
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:50,360
the actual work divided

718
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,719
by the isotropic, right?

719
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:53,239
So it's what is
the work here?

720
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:54,480
This is the work
you transfer

721
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,759
into the system, okay?

722
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,720
So an isentropic
efficiency

723
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,959
of a compressor is

724
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,559
the isentropic
compressor work

725
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,794
in divided by the actual
compressor work in.

726
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:08,109
The turbine is the
actual turbine work

727
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:10,949
out divided by the
isotropic turbine workout.

728
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:12,269
The way that I think
about this is,

729
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,869
in the case of a
turbine, I want to

730
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:16,109
maximize my
workout, right?

731
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,789
And if this is
an efficiency,

732
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:18,789
the maximum term has

733
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:20,029
to be in the denominator.

734
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:21,869
I want that to be
less than one.

735
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:23,749
It's the same with
the compressor.

736
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:25,150
For the compressor,
I want to put

737
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,749
the minimum work in
to compress that gas.

738
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:30,389
So that minimum work
has to be then in

739
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:33,389
the numerator
with it, right?

740
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:37,869
Okay. Cool. Do do do?

741
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:40,629
Where should I start?

742
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:47,360
I think I will
keep this formula

743
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,559
here and just jump
off from here.

744
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,960
So just like with
the turbine,

745
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,079
so we're going
to derive the

746
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,640
isentropic efficiency
of a compressor.

747
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,039
We're going to
assume adiabatic.

748
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,040
And for one of
the cases, we're

749
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,120
going to assume
reversible.

750
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,799
So we're going to

751
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,519
determine the
isotropic state.

752
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,280
We're going to
neglect kinetic

753
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,279
and potential
energies, right?

754
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,639
So we can write.

755
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:15,559
This one is no
longer gone, right?

756
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,360
This is going to be w.in.

757
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,799
We're not going to have
a W dot out, right?

758
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,399
So the w.in is going

759
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,039
to be equal to m
dot times H two.

760
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,869
Minus H one.

761
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:33,469
We can write this for

762
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,149
the isotropic case, right?

763
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:38,349
So that's going
to be M dot H

764
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,069
twos minus H one.

765
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:46,310
And we can write
w.in actual,

766
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:52,989
which is then.h2a
minus H one.

767
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,749
The definition, so E to C,

768
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:58,709
so the isentropic
efficiency of

769
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:01,469
a compressor is
then the ratio of

770
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:10,190
w.in isentropic divided
by w.in actual.

771
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,949
If we do our
substitutions,

772
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:16,869
M dot H twos minus H one,

773
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:22,509
m.h2a minus H one.

774
00:34:22,509 --> 00:34:27,949
The dots cancel this
is then just H two,

775
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,749
excuse me, H one,

776
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:34,109
H two A minus H one.

777
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:35,429
Again, the book
says this is

778
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,549
an approximation
because again,

779
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:37,869
we're neglecting
changes in

780
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:41,949
kinetic and
potential energy.

781
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,809
Good. But now we
need some right?

782
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:51,609
We need to basically

783
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:53,929
determine some
properties here.

784
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,809
Let's look and see.
I think I have

785
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:59,529
some properties
for this problem.

786
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,929
Okay. So again, we want to

787
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:09,329
define isotropic
efficiency of

788
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:14,689
a compressor. All right.

789
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:17,450
It's adiabatic.

790
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:23,569
Our P one and our
T one are equal to

791
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:29,969
100 kpa and let's
say 20 degrees C,

792
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,809
so something from ambient.

793
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:38,449
The P two is five
times P one,

794
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:42,809
so we can do 500 pa,

795
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,009
and the isotropic
efficiency

796
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,449
of the compressor is 0.9.

797
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:49,689
And again, we want

798
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,009
to determine those
temperatures,

799
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:55,369
and we'll also plot
a temperature TS

800
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,009
we'll create a TS diagram.

801
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,389
All right, so let's
look at state one,

802
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:02,949
so we can determine H one.

803
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:05,429
So state one here,

804
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,789
we know P one,

805
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:10,509
and we know T one.

806
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:12,469
And so from this, we're
going to know S one,

807
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:14,669
little S one, and
little H one.

808
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:17,109
So we have that.
We can determine

809
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:20,359
state two S. All right.

810
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,159
The input there
is that little

811
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,119
S two is equal
to little S one,

812
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,799
and we know P two.

813
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:32,279
So we have h2s there,

814
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,759
and we'll have
T two, right?

815
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:40,879
So the isentropic
enthalpy and temperature.

816
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:48,170
If we come back now
to Our formula.

817
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,369
So what did I say?
I said that this

818
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,489
is a given this is 0.9.

819
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,769
This we determined, right?

820
00:36:57,769 --> 00:36:59,689
Determined determined.

821
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:01,289
HwS we determined.

822
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,409
And so what you're
solving for here again

823
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:07,769
is H two A.

824
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:14,439
All right. And
so with this,

825
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:18,399
I have state two A.

826
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:20,599
Again, I know P two,

827
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,999
just like before, and
now I know H two.

828
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,199
And so with this, you're
going to be able to

829
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:31,279
determine T two actual,

830
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:35,079
right, which was Right?

831
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,559
So we know that
and we know that,

832
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,519
and that's what we

833
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,079
were asked to do
in the problem.

834
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,919
And thankfully,
in this case,

835
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,279
I did not print
the same value.

836
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:47,079
So here, T two,

837
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:49,759
what I have from
using Pyclor.

838
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:52,639
So with T two A,

839
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,319
I have 481 Kelvin.

840
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:07,614
And with TS, I
have 463 Kelvin.

841
00:38:07,614 --> 00:38:09,589
And why does
that make sense?

842
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:10,669
That makes sense.

843
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:12,629
Because in the
case when it's

844
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:15,909
an isentropic work
transfer process,

845
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:17,349
you need less work in.

846
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:18,270
You're transferring

847
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,669
less energy into
the system.

848
00:38:19,669 --> 00:38:21,269
And so if this is
something like,

849
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:22,189
you know, this was air,

850
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:23,789
we're working with
areas of fluid here,

851
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:25,389
compressors always
work with gases.

852
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:28,949
So if this is areas of
fluid, if we assume,

853
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:30,229
which we didn't
need to here, but

854
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:31,469
if you want to think
logically about it,

855
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:32,629
that air probably
behaves like

856
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:34,629
an ideal gas, right?

857
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:37,669
I put work into that,
transfer work in.

858
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:38,869
I'd have an expectation of

859
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:40,309
a change of my
internal energy,

860
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:41,949
and that only depends
on temperature.

861
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:43,429
So in this case, For

862
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:44,909
the case when I
put less work in,

863
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:46,589
I would expect a
lower temperature

864
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:48,470
at the end of the
compressor compared

865
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,909
to the actual case where I

866
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:52,389
have irreversibilities,
all right?

867
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:53,869
But again, the problem

868
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:56,670
solving approach
is identical,

869
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,230
you know, to the turbine.

870
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,029
I just have I have

871
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:00,909
a different formula for

872
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:02,509
the isentropic efficiency.

873
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:03,869
So in this case,
the ratio of

874
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:05,589
the isentropic work in

875
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:07,949
divided by the actual
work in, all right?

876
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,589
So that's the
only part where I

877
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:11,029
would say confusion
comes up into this.

878
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:12,269
Otherwise, we
have the formula.

879
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,150
You got that. Again,
plug and shug.

880
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,190
It should be straightfor.

881
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,989
Questions about this.

882
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,969
Am I going to finish
early? Yes, please.

883
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:25,049
Thank you, we expect
the temperature to

884
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:30,439
be higher on.
Say it again.

885
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,839
For the turbine, would

886
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,519
the temperature
differences be

887
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,879
swapped from
the compressor

888
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,519
with the temperature
higher on

889
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,559
the isotropic I'm not
sure. I have to see.

890
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,399
I'll have to see with
it. But what you would

891
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:45,559
expect for a system
that gets more workout.

892
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,240
So if you're thinking
about workout,

893
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,679
I think the better
question to ask

894
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,999
is actually
about pressure.

895
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:52,039
So which one actually
gets to, you know,

896
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,839
what is the you know,

897
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:55,759
if I was going
to think about

898
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,079
a term I know it
was fixed here.

899
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,840
I know the downstream
pressure was fixed,

900
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,359
but if I was

901
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,159
going to think
about one that was

902
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,599
going to be maximizing
more out of it,

903
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,439
I would think about like

904
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:06,519
a pressure term
downstream.

905
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,079
So yeah. But, I mean,

906
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,519
if I do have a
system and I take

907
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,239
more work out of it,
so if I, you know,

908
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,760
flipped it and
I said, I took

909
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,119
more work out of
this compared to,

910
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,519
you know, let's say I had

911
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,879
a turbine running on air,

912
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,079
right? It's an ideal gas.

913
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,559
If I took more work out

914
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,919
of one process
versus the other,

915
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,919
you know, what would
you expect the effect

916
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:28,119
on temperature at
the outlet to be?

917
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,599
Be lower, right? Yeah, so

918
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,799
and so I would think

919
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:33,039
then for the
steam turbine,

920
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,799
not applying ideal, but
if I looked at that,

921
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,359
that would be my
expectation going in.

922
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,399
Other questions?
Nice question.

923
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:41,199
And I got to
remember how to

924
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,400
use print in Python.

925
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,164
Alright. Great.
So that's it. I.

926
00:40:47,164 --> 00:40:49,889
So what you're going to
be able to do, again,

927
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,649
so reversible steady
flow work, you know,

928
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:55,049
processes there, we
drive Bernoulli today,

929
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:56,689
and you're going to
be able to apply now.

930
00:40:56,689 --> 00:40:57,529
We have two new
things, right,

931
00:40:57,529 --> 00:40:59,490
isentropic efficiency
of a turbine,

932
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,729
isentropic efficiency
of a compressor.

933
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:02,409
This allows us to

934
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:03,849
analyze real
devices, right?

935
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:05,009
You can go in and analyze.

936
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,489
These are things you
can look up, right?

937
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,129
You can look
that up and have

938
00:41:08,129 --> 00:41:09,889
it and facilitate it.

939
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:11,969
I am happy to stay
until the end of

940
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,010
lecture here in case
people have questions.

941
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,769
What I would say for
the quiz is we're

942
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:17,529
hard at work grading.
I hope to be done.

943
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:19,130
We hope to be
done by Friday

944
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,329
and release, okay?

945
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,049
Thank you.
