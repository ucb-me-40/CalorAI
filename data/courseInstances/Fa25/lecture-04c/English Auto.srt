1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Uh. Alright, so today,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,079
we're going to solve
energy balance problems

3
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:05,880
not only involving work,

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,280
but also heat. I
feel very loud.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,350
Um, That's one part of it.

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,230
The second part
of it is that

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,190
we're going to
go just beyond

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,790
the fluids and then
also into the solids.

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,429
And then after
day it picks up.

10
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:19,789
So like, on
Wednesday, Thursday,

11
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,149
or Wednesday and Friday,

12
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:22,469
and then Monday,
we're going to do,

13
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:25,589
like real devices
and things

14
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,789
that matter, for
what happens.

15
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,709
Okay? All right. So again,

16
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,669
today sort of my cadence
is usually right.

17
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,669
Like, I do a lot of
theory and math,

18
00:00:33,669 --> 00:00:35,029
and then I put it
to practice, okay,

19
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:36,389
which is pretty much
what engineering.

20
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,269
So today, we're going to

21
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:38,349
be putting some
stuff into practice.

22
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:40,589
Go through some problem

23
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:41,749
solving approaches that I

24
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,069
hope are then you know,

25
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:44,909
getting you into
good habits

26
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,549
for later on on
assessments, okay?

27
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,189
So, this one here,
we're looking at,

28
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,749
again, one of these
combined ones.

29
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:51,469
We have a process

30
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,509
here, we're
transferring work

31
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,990
in electrically into
a piston cylinder.

32
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,229
This is our control
volume drawn here,

33
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,989
and the system is

34
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,869
kept at constant
pressure, right?

35
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,139
And so what that
means All right,

36
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:06,579
as we transfer work in,

37
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:07,819
we may expect to
also have some

38
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,059
work transfer out, okay?

39
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,059
What makes it less
obvious if it's a work

40
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:13,339
transferred in or out from

41
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,899
that is that we
have a Q out, okay?

42
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,140
And I don't know
the magnitude

43
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,259
of Q out relative to

44
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,699
the work transfer that
I'm doing here. Okay?

45
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:20,659
And this question asks

46
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,779
us to determine
two things.

47
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,019
So the first is what's the

48
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,660
final temperature
of the steam?

49
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,499
And then what is
the difference

50
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:30,540
between these quantities

51
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,259
in the parentheses, okay?

52
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,899
And this U plus PV here,

53
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:36,399
again, is what not

54
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,119
really very useful
for this system.

55
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:39,199
It's kind of a trick,

56
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,199
but it's going
to become very,

57
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,639
very useful when we
get into things like

58
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:45,919
turbines and systems
that involve flow.

59
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,319
Okay? All right, so

60
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,759
here, what are we told
about the problem?

61
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,159
So we have our
mass defined.

62
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
We have a mass
that's here.

63
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,719
And remember, this
is a closed system,

64
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,199
so that mass doesn't
change, okay?

65
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,600
So we have a mass.

66
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,239
Let's talk about
state one.

67
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,039
So we have a
mass that's here

68
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,839
of 0.025 kg, right?

69
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:09,799
We have a P one
here that's given

70
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:13,319
as our 300 kPa.

71
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,760
What else do we know
about the initial state?

72
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,140
It was a good
weekend. Cow one.

73
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,380
It was awesome.
I was there.

74
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,540
Also, we honored some of

75
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,980
our great lecturers
at that game,

76
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,499
not just academics
or not just

77
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,860
athletics, also
academics there.

78
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,940
Okay, it's a saturated
vapor, right?

79
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,700
So basically, we start

80
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,859
off with saturated vapor,

81
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:38,100
which means the
quality is equal to.

82
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,020
One. There we go.

83
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,980
Like an extra point,
right? So there you go.

84
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,819
So we have a quality

85
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,180
of equal to one
there, right?

86
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,419
And with this, we
have sufficient

87
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,940
information to
define that state.

88
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,620
Good to go, okay?
About state two,

89
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,260
what do we know
about state

90
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,940
two? About state two?

91
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,460
We know the pressure.
We know that P

92
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,500
two is equal to P one.

93
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,060
So that's an
isoberic process.

94
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,859
Bless you. That's good.

95
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:05,580
And again, we
also know that,

96
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,900
the M one is equal
to the uh right,

97
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,140
we know that the mass

98
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,139
doesn't change
in the system.

99
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,780
And what we'd like
to know, right,

100
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,900
is we'd love to know
what T two is, okay?

101
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,820
And for us to be able
to do this, okay,

102
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,379
to get this right is
essentially to be able

103
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,420
to determine T two.

104
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,900
A, what we're going
to determine is

105
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,100
U two plus p2v2, okay?

106
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,019
I'll tell you that

107
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,060
that's a property
in a second.

108
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,340
But the energy
analysis that

109
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,740
I'm going to do
is that we're

110
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,220
going to determine
U two plus

111
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,700
P two times V two.

112
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,139
And with that information
and knowledge about

113
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,129
P two being 300 300 pa.

114
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,649
I'm going to be able to

115
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:50,570
tell you the state, okay?

116
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,210
So here, like I
said, I'm searching

117
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,010
for YouTube plus P

118
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,810
two times V two.

119
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,450
And with this, I'm
actually then going to be

120
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,770
able to answer what the
temperature is, okay?

121
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,090
Let me see. Am
I on my video?

122
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,410
Yeah, I'm good here.

123
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,820
Okay? All right, so
that's Essentially,

124
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,259
we'll we'll get started.

125
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,339
You see, am I
missing any points?

126
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,460
No. Okay, so now what

127
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,659
I'm going to write
is I'm going to

128
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,820
write essentially
the conservation of

129
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,379
energy applied to my

130
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,859
control volume
here, right?

131
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:28,500
So the area
contained within it.

132
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,779
So for that, I'm going
to say the Delta E CV,

133
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,059
where C andV denote

134
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:34,860
control volume is equal to

135
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,779
the energy that I transfer

136
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,579
in minus the energy
that I transfer out.

137
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,100
What are ways that energy

138
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,379
can change in the
control volume?

139
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,799
Yes. Kai Kai. I see.

140
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:54,600
Kai. Okay. See, I

141
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,919
practice this for
you and then you

142
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,759
practice your name
for me Delta U plus

143
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,739
Delta KE plus Delta B.

144
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:04,979
We'll see who needs
more practice,

145
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,100
remember it first, right?

146
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,419
So that's what we
have. Okay, right?

147
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,139
And then the way that
we can transfer energy

148
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,299
in right is I
can have W in,

149
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:15,259
work in, I can have
heat in, right?

150
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,499
And the way that
I can transfer

151
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:17,819
energy out of this
system, right,

152
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,139
is I can have W out
plus Q out, right?

153
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:26,380
Okay, right?

154
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,459
So our assumptions.

155
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,059
So if we were going

156
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,059
to talk about assumptions,

157
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:30,140
I'm doing things
in a little bit

158
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,299
of a reversed order.

159
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,979
But if we come to
some assumptions,

160
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,019
you know, here,
what assumptions

161
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,259
do you think you would
make in this problem?

162
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,680
I would say let's
go term by term.

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,160
So how do we feel
so I would say

164
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,000
for kinetic and
potential energy,

165
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,119
will neglect I will

166
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,334
basically neglect
Delta KE.

167
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:01,029
And Delta PE, all right?

168
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,869
I'll tell you when we
can't neglet that.

169
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:04,629
Systems where you
can't neglect that

170
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,829
are like rockets,
right, nozzles.

171
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:07,829
That's the whole
point, right?

172
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:08,869
I have a lot of energy.

173
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,229
I give gas, and I
want to go, right?

174
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,950
So that's when you
can't neglect it.

175
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,189
Delta PEs, you don't

176
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,749
neglect when you're
storing energy.

177
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,189
Think like pump
hydro, right?

178
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:18,350
I'm storing a
lot of stuff.

179
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,830
I'm not doing
pumped hydro,

180
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,949
and I don't see a
rocket in that, right?

181
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,590
So this basically
would be,

182
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,110
you know, two terms that
I'm getting rid of.

183
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,149
The other one that I
don't see here, right,

184
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:30,789
is a I don't see
a Q in, okay?

185
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,909
I do see a work
in, though,

186
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,110
in terms of the
electrical,

187
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,229
there is a
potential that we

188
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,349
may have, um, you know,

189
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:41,229
depending on
how much Q out,

190
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,869
there may be the
potential for

191
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,589
a potential W in,

192
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:46,149
but more likely than not,

193
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:47,989
you know, if I was going
to hazard a guess,

194
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:48,870
I would say that there's

195
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,989
the potential
for work to be

196
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,909
transferred out
via boundary work,

197
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,149
expansion work, okay?

198
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,389
And I can check that
a posteriori, right?

199
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,269
I could look at
that and say, if

200
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:59,589
I define this as W out,

201
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,669
how would I know
that this was then

202
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:04,549
work transferred in?
How would I know that?

203
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,670
It would be negative.
It would be negative.

204
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,750
Exactly. So if you're

205
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,069
consistent with that,
then you would know,

206
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,469
and then you could go
back and say, actually,

207
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,510
you know, my bad,

208
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,869
that's what I
meant, all right?

209
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,350
Okay, so this
is what we're,

210
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,829
you know, so we'll
set it up like this.

211
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,629
So for electrical work

212
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,789
in, how do we write this?

213
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,069
Okay, so we have
voltage, okay,

214
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:31,149
which I'll write with
some different version

215
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,789
of V. Again, we run
out of letters, right?

216
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:34,429
So I have voltage times my

217
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:37,029
current times my
duration, time, right?

218
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:39,909
So that's going to
be that's in SI,

219
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,349
volts amp seconds,

220
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,829
that'll give you
joules, okay?

221
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,869
So we have that there
is a work in term for

222
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:52,029
a work for a workout
term, right?

223
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,509
It's an isobaric process.

224
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,349
So how can I write the

225
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:58,325
boundary work term here?

226
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,939
Delta P Delta V, right?

227
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,179
So P, let's just
call it as P,

228
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,779
you know, one for now
because P one is P two,

229
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,419
but I got to give us
something, right?

230
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,299
That's going to be V two
minus RV one, right?

231
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:16,919
Okay. I could also
write this right?

232
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,759
Let's say it's P one
times the mass, right?

233
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,880
You know, so if
I say here that,

234
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,519
one is equal to two
is equal to M, right?

235
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,519
So then I can write
P one times N,

236
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,000
and then I can
write V two,

237
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,760
little V two minus
little V one, right?

238
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
So the specific
volumes I can

239
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,920
write in that way, okay?

240
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,760
I can also write this one

241
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,640
as also being as
M times U two,

242
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,880
little U two minus
little U one, right?

243
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,209
Recall, this is like
energy per volume.

244
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,900
Okay. Am I
missing anything?

245
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,899
No, that all looks
pretty good.

246
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,619
We can go on and do
the substitution.

247
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,820
So if I wrote
right this out,

248
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,729
I can push this
to the edge.

249
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:05,800
It is like hot
today. Oh, my God.

250
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,320
Um, so right here.

251
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,880
So we can we substitute
that in, right?

252
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,360
So that's basically
M times U two

253
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,120
minus U one is equal to V,

254
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,480
which is where this
is voltage, I,

255
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,479
which is current times T,

256
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,919
which is times,
duration minus,

257
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,400
then, here's the
negative sign.

258
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,160
So it's a negative of P

259
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,279
one times the mass times,

260
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,690
um, V two minus V one.

261
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,810
And then, again, we still
have a Q out that's

262
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,810
minus a Q out there, okay?

263
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,769
And so to create, right,

264
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,650
so if I want to create
this term here,

265
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,330
what I'm going to
do is I'm going to

266
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,730
move My pressure
volume terms,

267
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,290
these PV terms, I'm
basically going to

268
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,410
bring them to the
left hand sign.

269
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,130
This I know, right? So I

270
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,450
know the electrical
work in.

271
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,290
I know the heat out

272
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,850
because it's given
there, right?

273
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,489
So if we do that,
great arrangement.

274
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:10,930
So I can write M times
parentheses U two

275
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,195
minus or U two plus P one,

276
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:21,020
V two, and then that's
going to be minus

277
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,500
U one plus p1v1, right?

278
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,579
That's the left hand side.

279
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:29,820
Again, all I've
done is I've

280
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,460
moved this term
over to here,

281
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,539
and then that's equal
to our V voltage,

282
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:40,940
I current T time
minus RQ out.

283
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,340
Okay?

284
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:53,460
Sorry. Okay. All right.

285
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,699
Yeah, so that's
good. All right.

286
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,460
So what I'm going to do
right now, and again,

287
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,980
we'll go through this
in lecture five A,

288
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,460
which is on Wednesday.

289
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,860
But this U plus P plus
V is tabulated, right?

290
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,940
This is something given

291
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,300
in your book, all right?

292
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,540
This here we call H two,

293
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,460
right, because
P one is P two.

294
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,379
And then this term
here, we would call

295
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,460
is little H one, okay?

296
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,020
And the word for
this is enthalpy.

297
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,660
Okay. Someone
did the reading.

298
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,739
Great. Now reading ahead.

299
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:27,340
I love that even
more. All right.

300
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,380
I Yeah, that's basically
your enthalpy.

301
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,540
And the point
is that this is

302
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,339
something that can be

303
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:34,540
used as a property, right?

304
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,939
This can be an
independent property

305
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,619
that you use
with pressure,

306
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:39,219
specific volume,

307
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,540
temperature, and then you

308
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,700
have complete
information, right?

309
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,220
This is one of

310
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,339
those other
independent properties

311
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,140
that exists.

312
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,739
It really isn't different

313
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,099
than any other energy.

314
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,540
It's still energy, right?

315
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,939
Internal energy, enthropy,
Gibbs free energy.

316
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:55,499
These are all energies.

317
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,620
So it's still
energy, right?

318
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,029
Go ahead. We're using

319
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:02,229
pressure independent

320
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:04,030
from. Is that
what you said?

321
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,990
Yes. If you know
enthalpy and

322
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,830
you know pressure, you
can define everything.

323
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,390
Again, we'll go through an

324
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,990
example on that either on

325
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,149
Wednesday or Friday? Cool.

326
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,910
We can rearrange
and solve for this,

327
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,710
H two is equal to

328
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:29,070
V voltage current
time divided by

329
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:38,130
M minus Q out divided
by M plus H one, okay?

330
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,530
So if you go in now

331
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,249
and we do those
substitutions,

332
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:45,250
you'd get that
value, all right?

333
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,370
And the point is that
for H one, right,

334
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,409
we know H one because
we know this, right?

335
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,810
So basically,
knowing pressure,

336
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,170
knowing quality, right,

337
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,370
we know we would know
H one from this.

338
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,809
And if you want to
see how to do that,

339
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,810
that's located here in
the notebook, okay?

340
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,530
I'm not going to do

341
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,889
coating on the whiteboard.

342
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,830
I All right.

343
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,470
But yeah, the point
is that the inputs

344
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,070
that are pressure
and in quality,

345
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,670
and then you would
get you'd get H one.

346
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,830
Now with H two, so
now we know H two.

347
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,710
Two, we call this H two,

348
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,190
and by having H
two and P two,

349
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,990
you're able to
determine you're

350
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,830
able to determine
T two there.

351
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,590
I have a value for H two,

352
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,830
so my value for H

353
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,030
two is this my
value for H two?

354
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,069
What am I printing?
No, I'm printing

355
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:37,310
my um I can

356
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,149
put some let's put
some terms in here.

357
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,790
Basically, um, D. Yes.

358
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,790
My H two here, if
you put that in is

359
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,509
3,009 kilojoules
per kilogram.

360
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:54,910
Again,

361
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,910
by knowing this
information

362
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,590
and knowing the pressure,

363
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,270
you determine T two and

364
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,430
then T two is equal to

365
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:06,029
270 degrees C, right?

366
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:13,030
Let's see. Cool. So
that's all good.

367
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,070
You could represent
this on a PV diagram.

368
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,750
So you could go and
create, like I do

369
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,750
in that document,
a PV diagram.

370
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,430
So there's your line
of saturation, okay?

371
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,109
So low values of
V are liquids,

372
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:26,469
of saturated liquid,
saturated vapor.

373
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:27,870
Where you start off with

374
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,750
is that this pressure,

375
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,549
right, so we have this
P one that's here.

376
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,669
You start off on the
line of saturation,

377
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:35,505
which is the
quality of, um,

378
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:37,940
right, which is the
quality of one here.

379
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,820
And you move isoberically,

380
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,980
then to state to
state two, right?

381
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,460
So the net result
of this basically

382
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,700
this process is where
you you'd end up,

383
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,060
and you would know
that again by

384
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,460
figuring out what
the H two is.

385
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,660
If the H two is
less than H one,

386
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
then this would
then be moving

387
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,580
in the opposite
direction, okay?

388
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,339
Cool. Any questions
about that?

389
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,969
Yes, please. Got
the pressure.

390
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,810
Yeah. The thing is that

391
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,450
you can use this
as an input.

392
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,810
I know, and you

393
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,930
can also do that
in your tables.

394
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,290
If you want to go
in and do tables,

395
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,249
you can also interpolate,

396
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:21,130
you look at the value.

397
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,970
But the point is that
right here, state two,

398
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,010
let's say state two
is basically do

399
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,930
state of water here,

400
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:40,170
P is equal to P
two or P one,

401
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,850
depending on how
you define it.

402
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,730
This is how do we give it?

403
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,930
This is in pa, so

404
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,970
you can declare
the units of

405
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,230
pa. Like that, and
then H, right?

406
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,270
So the H, you write
H equal to H two,

407
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,910
and just put
that in as units

408
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,429
of kilojoules
per kilogram.

409
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,550
And you can also
name it, right?

410
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,790
You go name equals two,

411
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,030
and then you would
have that, right?

412
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,230
And then the way
that you call it in

413
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,590
dot notation is
that, let's say,

414
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,110
in this case, S two,

415
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,589
do little H will then
give you enthalpy.

416
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:12,750
Again, all the
information is in

417
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,869
the notebook there,

418
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:15,390
but that's how
it works, okay?

419
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,750
And get comfortable with

420
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,470
this because we're going

421
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,229
to do other properties.

422
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:19,310
There's going to
be a bunch of

423
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,030
other dot, you
know, things there.

424
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,470
So right now
we're at dot H,

425
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,380
right? Other
questions? Okay.

426
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,180
Yeah, because we know H

427
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,580
two and we learned one,

428
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,940
then you'd be able to
compute, right, right?

429
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,820
You could look up the
internal energy, right?

430
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,779
So if you wanted to
know internal energy,

431
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,260
right, you can
go t two dot U.

432
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,140
If you want to learn
the volume, right,

433
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,700
this would be like
two dot little V

434
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,340
and so on and so forth
to pull those values.

435
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,220
And the same thing
then for state one,

436
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,180
t dot, you know,

437
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,320
U, P, you know,

438
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,999
and then you could also
do dot, dot V, right?

439
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:57,720
And it's instructive
for you to

440
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,520
multiply those out to
actually take those,

441
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,720
do the calculation
like that,

442
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,239
and then compare it
with actually what

443
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,559
the enthalpy values
would be, okay?

444
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,879
I highly recommend for
systems like this.

445
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:12,399
So closed systems
like that, like,

446
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:16,079
resist the urge to
jump straight to,

447
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,239
you know, Delta H, okay?

448
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,639
I would say start
from, you know,

449
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:24,599
the fundamentals
writing like, you know,

450
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,240
this, organize your
internal energies,

451
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,320
make your assumptions
about pressures,

452
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,879
move things over. Okay?

453
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,679
If you read the book,
which some of you have.

454
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,839
They for things like

455
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,639
constant pressure
processes,

456
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:40,319
will encourage you
to jump and say,

457
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,279
Hey, I could just write
Delta H here, okay?

458
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,720
I mean, you can
also do that,

459
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,600
but I find that when I

460
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,800
teach ME 40 to students
and they have,

461
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,639
Oh, I don't know when
to do internal energy.

462
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:52,999
I don't know when
to do enthalpy.

463
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:53,880
Don't think like that.

464
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,120
Just start from
the basics,

465
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,599
this to this, you know,
to this, and, like,

466
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,760
let it all evolve
out naturally

467
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,279
to where you can
form, you know,

468
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:01,959
mathematically,

469
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,719
your enthalpies and
then go into it,

470
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,120
okay? Otherwise,
it's confusing.

471
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,999
You have to hold
too much in your

472
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,359
you already have enough to

473
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,679
keep in your heads, okay?

474
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,559
Good? Yes, please.
Right I missed it.

475
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,079
How did you get one?

476
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,839
E one, this is easy.

477
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,239
Each one is I know

478
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,879
my pressure and I
know my quality.

479
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:21,520
I know two independent
properties.

480
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,039
If I declare this in PCLor

481
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,040
which you can do if
you click that link,

482
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,800
you put that in
and then you

483
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,479
just go st dot H.

484
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,199
You just would
write an St dot H,

485
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:35,280
and that would
give you enthalpy.

486
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,239
You know these two

487
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,239
and you have complete
information.

488
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:43,480
Okay. If there's no
other questions,

489
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,319
then I'm going
to move on to

490
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:48,039
the next one. All right.

491
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,319
I'm again.

492
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,899
Did anyone go
to the lecture

493
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,699
today from Admiral
Meyer or no?

494
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,619
One? What did you think?

495
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,499
That was a great lecture.

496
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:24,459
Yeah. Yeah, he was
basically right

497
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:27,219
a mechanical engineering
student like you.

498
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:29,180
What's up? Plus nuclear.

499
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,939
Yeah, I did nuclear,
but I think

500
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:32,660
his core expertise
originally

501
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,419
was mechanical there.

502
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,539
Yeah, it was neat.
Very inspiring.

503
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,379
Okay. Great, great, great.

504
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,700
I liked what he said about

505
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,659
if you want to go
fast, go alone.

506
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,379
If you want to go
far, go together.

507
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:57,979
I think that's the
thing one of the things

508
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,139
I'm going to keep
in my mind, okay?

509
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:04,650
All right, so going with,
final temperatures.

510
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,769
Alright, so this
one, again,

511
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,529
so the previous
one was with,

512
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:09,489
let's see, with water.

513
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:12,170
We'll do this one
with nitrogen.

514
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,090
Nitrogen's an ideal gas.

515
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,930
I'll solve this
one in two ways.

516
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,810
One essentially doing
the way that we did,

517
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,250
and then I'll show
you one assumption

518
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,089
you can make with an
ideal gas for this.

519
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,889
Again, we have work
transferred in,

520
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:27,089
we have heat
transferred out,

521
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:28,649
and the potential
to transfer work

522
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:32,689
from through boundary
work, right?

523
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,850
So my first step in
my thermal problem,

524
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,729
I'm going to draw a
schematic in a boundary.

525
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:37,849
So here's my boundary.

526
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:39,770
That defines my
control volume.

527
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,319
Um, And what I'm going to

528
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,120
assume here check my
video. I still good.

529
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,480
Okay, what I'm
going to assume

530
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,640
here is that I'm dealing

531
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,439
with an ideal gas, okay?

532
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,680
So we have an ideal gas.

533
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,200
That's an assumption.

534
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,880
We have quasi

535
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:10,200
equilibrium expansion
or compression.

536
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:21,129
All right. We're going
to neglect Delta KE,

537
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:23,649
and we're going to
neglect Delta P.

538
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,010
Kinetic potential
energy effects.

539
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,409
And we're going to assume
that boundary work.

540
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:35,130
Boundary work is
only through P dv.

541
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,769
All right? Okay.
Good. All right.

542
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,569
Then what are
we looking for?

543
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,889
Let me say that first.

544
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,249
So what we're
looking for in

545
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:47,970
this problem is the
final temperature.

546
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:57,649
So determine Final
temperature.

547
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,889
Okay.

548
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,810
Also,

549
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,689
the lecture hall there
was, like, amazing.

550
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:08,170
And I mean, this
is pretty nice,

551
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,250
but that one was
very, very nice here.

552
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,890
I hadn't been in the
Grimes building yet.

553
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,409
Okay. All right.

554
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:16,209
So again, you know,

555
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,609
from our
fundamentals, right?

556
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,889
So our Delta, right?

557
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,449
So basically the Delta E

558
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:21,810
and our control volume.

559
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,449
So within the dashed
line is, again,

560
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:30,399
our E in minus
our E out. Okay.

561
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,559
At some point, you

562
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,759
won't have to write
this every time,

563
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,439
but I'm just
doing it so you

564
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,679
can follow your steps.

565
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,719
Again, we over Delta U,

566
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:43,319
our Delta KE, our
Delta P is again,

567
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,639
equal to write
our Wn I'm sorry,

568
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,839
Wn plus our Q in

569
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:56,359
minus R W out plus our
Q out there, okay?

570
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,200
So we can neglect
potential

571
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,880
and kinetic
energy effects.

572
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,099
All right. I see right
that we have a Q out,

573
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,659
but I don't have
a Q in, right?

574
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:14,020
So the Q in is gone.

575
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,619
And again, our work in

576
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:17,139
here is just like before.

577
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:18,300
We have the
electrical work,

578
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,259
so we have duration,

579
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:20,900
we have current,
we have voltage.

580
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,819
So we have voltage,
which I'll write with

581
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,019
this kind of in
this kind of way.

582
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:28,540
Voltage times my
current times my time.

583
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,099
So that defines
the work in.

584
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:34,530
And for our workout,

585
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,520
Again, we're
told that it's

586
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,120
an isobaric process.

587
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,319
So our work then is
this P. So if I called

588
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,599
this if I called this as

589
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,959
P one equals to P
two equals to P,

590
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,679
then I'll just
call this as P,

591
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,039
and then I'll
multiply that by V

592
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,959
two minus V one.

593
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:03,239
All right? My Q
out um is a given.

594
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:06,839
Okay. That is good.

595
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:10,669
Um Where am I at?

596
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:12,829
Yeah, so just like
we did before,

597
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:16,869
so I can separate,
um, these things,

598
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,790
so I can go with
my M times,

599
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,349
my U two minus my U one.

600
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:25,470
So again, we have
constant mass?

601
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:31,149
So our M is equal to
a constant, right?

602
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,590
So I have the mass,

603
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:42,349
that's equal to my VT V

604
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:45,909
minus my pressure times

605
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:48,189
my mass times
little V two.

606
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:50,269
Minus little V one,

607
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:54,629
and then that's minus
my Q out, right?

608
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:56,749
Again, we can
organize that to have

609
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:59,230
enthalpy form, you
know, naturally.

610
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,509
So here, right, I'll
have U two plus

611
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:10,709
p2v2 minus U two or
U one plus p1v1.

612
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,990
The pressures
are constant,

613
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,989
so we'll just call that
as P, right there.

614
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:17,789
And then that
would be equal to

615
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:22,869
V T minus Q out.

616
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:27,950
Enthalpy two, I'll
move the boards.

617
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,859
Okay. All right, so
this is your H two,

618
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,339
and then this
is your H one.

619
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,860
And then we can,
you know, solve

620
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,659
for H two, again, just
like we did before.

621
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:49,699
Our H two here is
H one plus the

622
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:57,739
V. So voltage current
time minus Q out,

623
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,739
and then that whole
thing is divided by

624
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:03,699
the mass in the cylinder.

625
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:06,179
All right. And just like
with the vapor case,

626
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,219
you know, once I
know um, H two,

627
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:10,899
because I know P two,

628
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:12,980
I know the um I

629
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,219
know the final
state at T two.

630
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:18,939
So we can look at some
properties, okay?

631
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:23,139
Properties. All right,

632
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:24,620
so let's talk
about properties.

633
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:31,100
So, um, it's an ideal gas,

634
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,700
so we can determine
the mass.

635
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,139
Our mass is equal
to our P one,

636
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,219
which we can just call as

637
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:40,580
P since it's constant.

638
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,819
P times V one,

639
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:44,739
V one is given as

640
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:47,619
half a cubic
meter divided by

641
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:52,899
the specific gas
constant R and T one.

642
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:58,099
R, in this case,
for nitrogen is

643
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:07,380
296.8 joules per
kilogram times Kelvin.

644
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,459
Again, this is nothing but

645
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,900
the universal
gas constant,

646
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,099
and then divided by

647
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,980
the molar mass of
the substance,

648
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,339
and then you can
get to that value.

649
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:22,329
Okay, um, Is that good?

650
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:25,050
Yeah, so if you
substitute,

651
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,969
the pressures and the
volumes and all that,

652
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:28,689
which you'll have
is the mass is

653
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:33,810
2.2 kilograms.

654
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,170
That's your first step.

655
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,410
The Q out we have as
a given in joules,

656
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,170
the voltage, the
current, the time,

657
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,729
our W in, which was

658
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:47,229
our I times our voltage
times our time.

659
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:51,169
Okay, so our I
is two amps,

660
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,530
our voltage is 120 volts,

661
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,809
and the duration is

662
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:05,449
five times 60
seconds, all right?

663
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:07,649
And then this, if you
multiply it through,

664
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:10,880
then you'll have 7,272,070

665
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,300
2000 joules

666
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,579
of electrical work
that's transferred in.

667
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:20,619
If you want to use
again, if you want

668
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,340
to use electronic tables,

669
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,619
the way then to
get to H one,

670
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:27,579
we need to know
right here,

671
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:29,179
this H one to have that.

672
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:31,459
O H one would
depend on our

673
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:35,179
state one, our state one,

674
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:43,689
we know P one and
we know our P one,

675
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,889
which is basically
just P, and then we

676
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:49,850
know RT one there
with this, right?

677
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,049
And so if you
use these two,

678
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:54,529
you'd be able to
then produce,

679
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,489
basically from
this information,

680
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:58,689
you'd be able to
then know what H one

681
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:02,970
is as a value, okay? Cool.

682
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,729
So then, H one
you have, right?

683
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,489
This is our work in,

684
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:10,689
which we just
computed here,

685
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:12,489
our Q out, right?

686
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:17,080
This is given already
as 2,800 Jules,

687
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,880
the M is what we
just determined

688
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,559
here with our ideal
gas relation, right?

689
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,919
Then from that, if

690
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,479
you substitute
it and you'll be

691
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:30,599
able to get to our H two.

692
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,419
And so for state
two, All right.

693
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:37,779
What you know then
is, you know,

694
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,860
H two and you know
pressure, right?

695
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,140
And so with this
information, you'd

696
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,259
be able to
determine T two.

697
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,380
Okay? Yeah, so, you know,

698
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,979
pretty plug and
shock, okay?

699
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:55,739
I'll give you one
alternative way

700
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:58,139
to this, so let
me move this in.

701
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,969
Well, I guess
I should tell

702
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,050
you what the
temperature is.

703
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:08,290
So the temperature
is here 56.

704
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,849
So I have 56 degrees
Celsius, right?

705
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,969
So the one alternative way

706
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:17,169
to look at this
is to pick up

707
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:24,129
from our definition for
our energy equation.

708
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:28,889
So H two is H one
plus V voltage

709
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:32,209
current time minus Q

710
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:35,249
out divided by
M, all right?

711
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:38,370
And to recognize that
for an ideal gas,

712
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,970
so we can recognize

713
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,930
basically for
an ideal gas,

714
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,289
that the differential
of enthalpy,

715
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:49,249
so dH is equal
to CP, right?

716
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:51,530
So, specific

717
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:58,089
heat at constant
temperature, right?

718
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,489
And we could do this
substitution then.

719
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:03,129
So if we assume so if we

720
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:10,289
assume that Cp is
equal to a constant,

721
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:11,810
which, you know, for

722
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,049
temperature differences
of, like, you know,

723
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:19,169
less than than 100 degrees
Celsius different.

724
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,489
That's an okay assumption.

725
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:25,129
What you can do
then, is we can say

726
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:28,250
H two minus H
one is equal to

727
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,009
Cp times T two
minus T one, right?

728
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:34,249
And for this
difference, it

729
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:35,730
doesn't matter
if it's Kelvin

730
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,630
minus Kelvin or
Celsius minus Celsius,

731
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,889
but it has to be
like the same units

732
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:43,529
because you
want the right,

733
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,009
you want the
difference in that.

734
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,490
And so if you substitute

735
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,049
this above, you can
then rearrange,

736
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:50,729
and what you can
say is that T two

737
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:54,009
is then equal to T one,

738
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:59,770
plus, plus V voltage

739
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,729
current time minus Q out,

740
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:08,879
and then that all divided
by M and cp, okay?

741
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:11,429
And CP, this is, again,
this is very common.

742
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,230
You know, this is
like Googleable,

743
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,669
you know, values.

744
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,509
They also exist and
are published in

745
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:20,670
the back of the
book in tables.

746
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,310
And as you get

747
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,629
comfortable working
with, like,

748
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:25,389
you know, air or
water, you know,

749
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:27,910
these things they'd be
provided on quizzes,

750
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,709
but it's also the kind

751
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:29,949
of thing that, you know,

752
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,349
you may be able to
remember just off

753
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,309
the top of the top
of your head, okay?

754
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:34,549
And the rest of it
you would know.

755
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:35,789
So this is the
table information,

756
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,229
but the rest of
it you have,

757
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:38,510
and the T one is given.

758
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,149
And so that's another
way to get to T

759
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:44,400
two to T two there,
okay? Yes, please.

760
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,089
Give us I'm going to
give you the whole back

761
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:49,449
of the textbook in

762
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:52,009
properties on all of
the quizzes, right?

763
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,810
And if I'm kind, sometimes
I will write, Hey,

764
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,250
here's the CP of
the substance,

765
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,930
so you don't need to
flip back and forth.

766
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,169
And generally, I'm kind

767
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:00,689
unless you make me not be,

768
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,810
all right? Other
questions?

769
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,090
So again, basically,

770
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,410
it's the same
drill as before.

771
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,450
What's interesting
about the ideal gases,

772
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:09,690
though,

773
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,969
is you can follow
this approach of

774
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,369
going with states and

775
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:14,249
properties and determining

776
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:15,849
enthalpies there, right?

777
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:17,690
And then from
that enthalpy

778
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,249
getting to the
temperature.

779
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,769
But the other thing
that you're allowed

780
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:22,329
to do is to go
this approach.

781
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:24,329
This is actually this is,

782
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,209
this is by
definition, right?

783
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:28,170
So dH is equal to Cp dT.

784
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,210
This is not just
for ideal gases.

785
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,889
You know, so
you can go and

786
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:33,649
then write, you know,

787
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:37,700
Delta H, Cp dT and
do the substitution.

788
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,229
Right? The only
thing, though,

789
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:40,790
what's the what makes

790
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,469
this a bad assumption
sometimes,

791
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:44,629
right, is if I want to
get to this equation,

792
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:46,709
right, and you take
the integral, okay?

793
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:49,149
And what you're assuming
when you do this is

794
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:50,229
you're taking the CP

795
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:51,509
out of the
integral, right?

796
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:52,869
So you're assuming that's

797
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,189
a constant value, right?

798
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:56,229
And it's the
delta T, right?

799
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:58,149
Um. And to know whether

800
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,110
or not this is a good
or a bad assumption,

801
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,749
it only comes
with, like, time.

802
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:05,220
But my rule of thumb
would be for, um,

803
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,890
like, just gases,

804
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,849
like ideal gases and
stuff like that.

805
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,289
That's usually a pretty
good assumption.

806
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,289
Better than 5%
let's say probably

807
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:17,129
better than 5% error
most of the time.

808
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:19,689
For liquids and stuff,
too, also, you know,

809
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:22,009
it's generally, you
know, pretty good.

810
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:23,650
And then this is
also just faster.

811
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,849
It's much faster, right,

812
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:26,329
to just get to
this and jump to

813
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,569
that than what I've
done there, okay?

814
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:31,129
That's my first
comment about it.

815
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:33,169
So I would
recommend, you know,

816
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:34,409
do whatever you feel, you

817
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,009
know, basically
comfortable with.

818
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:37,609
Both are correct,
in my view,

819
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,969
for the purposes
of this course,

820
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,929
but that one is the
more exact, right?

821
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,249
That one is the
more exact way,

822
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:43,949
okay? One thing.

823
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,349
Second thing I want to say

824
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,989
is that the book, okay,

825
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:50,470
if you read it
has an approach,

826
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,310
and you'll see this
that comes later.

827
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,349
But they have, you know,

828
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:56,109
kind of funny approaches

829
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:57,709
when it comes to
these kind of

830
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:00,989
CP dT things, right?

831
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:03,029
So they'll have an
approach where,

832
00:35:03,029 --> 00:35:04,829
you know, with
some math, right,

833
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:06,069
they'll be able to not

834
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,550
assume this kind
of constant,

835
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,529
you know, specific
heat and all of that.

836
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:13,549
And that's all
fine and well,

837
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:15,189
but, like, this is
what you start with.

838
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:17,429
And if you want to be
exact, just go to this.

839
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,989
Don't bother with any sort

840
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:21,950
of confusing tricks
because this gets

841
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,909
you exact properties
at those states and

842
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:28,789
will be the most
accurate, okay?

843
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:32,379
Okay. Um, The final thing

844
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:33,539
I want to mention
about this is that,

845
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:34,059
you know, you have

846
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:35,099
a free choice
when it comes

847
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,819
to the selection of
this CPE, right?

848
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:38,139
The fact that it's
going to be between

849
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,379
two different
temperatures.

850
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:40,739
My advice on this is just

851
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:41,939
go room temperature.

852
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,339
Most of this class, you're

853
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:44,859
just going to say,
what value do I take?

854
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:46,139
I'll go to the
table, look,

855
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:48,099
I'll choose one,
and just say,

856
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:52,299
I took this CPE at
room temperature.

857
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,859
That's it. So
I went there.

858
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:55,179
I went room temperature,

859
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:57,419
and I picked this um

860
00:35:57,419 --> 00:35:59,499
You can also pick
from a different one,

861
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:00,939
that's perfectly
fine, too.

862
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:03,619
But I would say go in,

863
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,099
pick one, say where
you got it from.

864
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,419
You don't need
to defend it.

865
00:36:07,419 --> 00:36:08,979
You know, you say,
press your shot,

866
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:10,059
you said so, you
know, that'll

867
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:11,779
work here, not
for a job, okay?

868
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:14,019
But, you know, you can
go room temperature

869
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:15,179
and just say,

870
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,019
and like I said, for
most of these problems,

871
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:17,579
that's going to be

872
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:18,579
a pretty accurate
approach.

873
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,819
And if you ever
doubt it, right,

874
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:21,379
especially in the
homework, you know,

875
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,699
by all means, go in and

876
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:25,144
do the exact
calculation, alright?

877
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:30,149
All clear? Yes, please.
Yeah, sure, sure.

878
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:33,589
This I cannot
slide. Sorry.

879
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:35,069
But it is all there. So if

880
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,189
you click it,
you'll see it.

881
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:40,149
All right. Cool. Let
me erase them. Do do.

882
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:41,749
Feels like repeats today.

883
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:43,789
All right. Do do do.

884
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:45,749
That was my least
favorite day of running.

885
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:46,909
Okay.

886
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:50,029
All right, that's gone.

887
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,999
And then these
examples that I had

888
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:00,679
there also may be

889
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,760
helpful for some
of the homework.

890
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,639
So some of the ones you

891
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,719
we don't know where
to get started.

892
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,439
Some of these ones
from class might be

893
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,519
helpful for some
of the homework,

894
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,479
especially let's say
Homework three there.

895
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,479
Okay to

896
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:23,919
do I

897
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:31,829
Okay. All right.

898
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:34,589
So now, you know,

899
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:35,789
we're just doing basically

900
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,149
fluids there or basically,

901
00:37:37,149 --> 00:37:39,669
let's call it steam
as a vapor or

902
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:41,910
a gas and the nitrogen

903
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,629
that we dealt
with as a gas.

904
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,949
When we want to
evaluate changes in

905
00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:47,109
internal energy or

906
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:48,269
let's say also
this, you know,

907
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,149
kind of new this term,

908
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:53,749
enthalpy when it comes
to liquids or solids,

909
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,509
you're not going to so

910
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:57,229
basically for
like a liquid

911
00:37:57,229 --> 00:38:01,350
or so a liquid or a solid,

912
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:08,549
okay, um, C is
CP is CV, okay?

913
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:10,149
The reason, right, is we

914
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:11,349
got CP because when we

915
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:12,629
transfer heat in to

916
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:13,949
something at
constant pressure,

917
00:38:13,949 --> 00:38:15,949
it could also transfer
workout, right?

918
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:17,989
So you would expect
there, essentially that

919
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:19,709
to be a bigger term,

920
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:22,709
which it is for
gases like that,

921
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:24,669
CP is greater than CV.

922
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,709
In liquids and solids,

923
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:29,269
when we heat them, they

924
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:30,469
don't generally expand

925
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:33,549
as much as you would
have in a vapor, okay?

926
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:36,069
So what we call
them is we call

927
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:40,044
these substances
incompressible, okay?

928
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:43,299
When you take ME
one oh one oh six,

929
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:45,659
you'll get more
into what it means.

930
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,779
But essentially, if I
apply a pressure to it,

931
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:49,979
does it change volume,
yes or no, okay?

932
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,579
And if it doesn't
appreciably change,

933
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:55,499
it's an incompressible
substance, right?

934
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,099
So in a solid, you know,

935
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:00,699
so in a solid here, okay.

936
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,139
So for this slide
here, right?

937
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,259
So the C is the
CP is the CV,

938
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,499
it's incompressible,
all right?

939
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:10,659
And for that reason,
um, you know,

940
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:12,819
it only depends
on, you know,

941
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:14,019
so change then in

942
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:18,239
internal energy
is, um, right?

943
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,800
Is only a function

944
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,559
then, of
temperature, right?

945
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,839
So basically this,

946
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,399
how to use this
in practice.

947
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:26,039
If you go to your
book, it will

948
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,879
not say C for a solid.

949
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,439
What you'll see is
that it's called CP.

950
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:32,479
I don't know. It is.

951
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:32,799
Okay?

952
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:34,439
It could just be
C, but basically,

953
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,999
when you go in, you'll
see that this is a CP.

954
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,639
And again, it's
right, CP is CV.

955
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,679
If dU is equal to CV dt,

956
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,639
Iso facto, right, this is

957
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,374
then Cp dT there, right?

958
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:52,909
Cool. One, and like
I said before,

959
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:54,989
for this case,
especially for solids,

960
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:55,589
there's not going to

961
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:56,869
be multiple values, right?

962
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:57,829
Most of the tables

963
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:58,829
and stuff that
you look up,

964
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,069
one poor guy
or gal went in

965
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:03,229
and measured this
probably 100 years ago.

966
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:04,989
They did it at this
one temperature,

967
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:06,429
and they put
them in a table.

968
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:08,069
Bless him for
that. We have it,

969
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:09,029
but you're not
going to see

970
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:10,189
this for like zero, ten,

971
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:12,589
20, 30, onto 100 degrees

972
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:13,509
C. It's just going to be

973
00:40:13,509 --> 00:40:14,909
a one temperature,
all right?

974
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:17,229
Okay. So when you
want to do that,

975
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:17,829
you'll say, okay,

976
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,269
here's what I looked
up in the table.

977
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:20,830
That's my specific heat,

978
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,864
and there's my
temperature difference.

979
00:40:22,864 --> 00:40:24,420
Cool.

980
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,859
All right. For
the enthalpy,

981
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,139
so going into
the enthalpy,

982
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:30,059
right, that's
our definition.

983
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,059
If I take a full
differential of that, right,

984
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,339
I'll have the DU, but I'll

985
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:35,339
have PDV VDP, okay?

986
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,139
And because it's
incompressible,

987
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:38,819
the volume doesn't
change, right?

988
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:40,379
So the DV term, it's

989
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:42,219
not there, right?
So that's out.

990
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:45,039
Um, And so you
can integrate.

991
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,959
And again, assuming a
constant specific key,

992
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:48,839
you'll have that
value, right?

993
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,479
And what I'm telling you,

994
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,519
what I'm going to tell you

995
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,839
here is that in solids,

996
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:55,879
it's a very low
value of V, okay?

997
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:59,199
It's like 0.001,

998
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,719
or less meter cube
per kilogram, okay?

999
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,279
So a very tiny value,

1000
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,639
even times a big pressure
differential is not

1001
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,599
a very big value.
Does it makes sense.

1002
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,799
So like this
term, in a solid,

1003
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:14,239
because it has a
very high density or

1004
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,959
a very low specific heat,
also insignificant.

1005
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,679
So you're going to
end up essentially

1006
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,039
changes in
internal energy,

1007
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,599
and the changes
in Xenthalpy,

1008
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,399
which we'll go into
more, are just

1009
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:25,479
going to be C delta.

1010
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:29,159
And that's in a solid
in a liquid, okay?

1011
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,919
The same statement about

1012
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:35,119
internal energy,
you know, holds.

1013
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,309
For enthalpy, though, Um,

1014
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:44,269
the VDP doesn't
necessarily go away, okay?

1015
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,229
And that has to do with

1016
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:46,309
the fact that you can get

1017
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:48,789
some pretty big pressure

1018
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:50,990
differences when you pump,

1019
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,309
okay? So you
have two cases.

1020
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,869
One is that I don't
have a pressure drop.

1021
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:55,829
That's a heat exchanger.

1022
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:56,869
So I have a
heat exchanger.

1023
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:57,950
There's not going
to be a pressure

1024
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,389
drop across a
heat exchanger.

1025
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,629
So the change
is going to be

1026
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:02,349
C delta T. On
the other hand,

1027
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:03,629
when you deal
with a pump, when

1028
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:04,709
you deal with,
like, a pump,

1029
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:06,189
and I'm transferring
work in

1030
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:08,150
from a pump and I'm
moving a fluid,

1031
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,469
those are generally
isothermal processes.

1032
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:12,349
And so that change in
enthalpy is going to

1033
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,669
be a V Delta P term, okay?

1034
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:17,669
Um, If you were to say,

1035
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:20,349
like, Hey, I have
a CDT and a VDP,

1036
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:21,829
more likely than not,

1037
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:23,029
this is not going to be a

1038
00:42:23,029 --> 00:42:24,709
big it's just not

1039
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,829
going to be a big term
in the C delta T.

1040
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:30,069
And we actually exploit
this fact when we

1041
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:31,549
pump fluids that it

1042
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,389
requires very little
work to pump a fluid.

1043
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,349
Like a whole fricking
power plant basically

1044
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:38,109
plays off of the game
that a vapor has,

1045
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:40,469
you know, very
low density,

1046
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:41,710
very high specific volume.

1047
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,150
So VDP is very big
there from a turbine.

1048
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,309
That's the workout, and

1049
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:46,669
the work in is
from the pump.

1050
00:42:46,669 --> 00:42:48,069
And that's VDP, but it's

1051
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:49,749
with a liquid, and
the V is very low.

1052
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:51,509
The Delta P across
is the same.

1053
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:52,869
That's pretty
much the name

1054
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:54,349
of the game, alright?

1055
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:56,749
Okay. Yeah, so we did

1056
00:42:56,749 --> 00:42:59,909
ideal we did this problems
energy analysis of

1057
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,509
involving work in heat for

1058
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:04,389
the ideal gas for

1059
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:05,549
the pure substance in

1060
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,110
the case of the
water vapor,

1061
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,309
again,

1062
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:08,269
click on the links

1063
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:09,269
and review that
if you want.

1064
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:10,829
The last one that
we'll do, I'll

1065
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,269
start this now, and
if I don't have time,

1066
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:14,229
I'll finish it in

1067
00:43:14,229 --> 00:43:15,509
the next lecture
is to deal with

1068
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,229
incompressible
substances. All right.

1069
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:18,829
So in this problem,
we're looking

1070
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,949
at cooling of
a solid block.

1071
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:22,629
So I think like
in this case,

1072
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:25,239
we have hot, um,
you know, hot iron.

1073
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:25,759
So we're in

1074
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:27,079
a material science
department here.

1075
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,239
So that's kind of an
appropriate example.

1076
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,839
So here you basically
have, you know,

1077
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,199
hot chunk of metal
that is being

1078
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,639
dropped with some mass and

1079
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:38,119
it's being dropped
into a liquid,

1080
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,359
which is at a lower one.

1081
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,479
And what we want to do is

1082
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:41,759
to determine the
temperature when

1083
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:45,229
equilibrium is
reached, okay?

1084
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:47,059
We can draw, right?

1085
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:50,099
I can draw pretty much
two control volumes

1086
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,779
and the sum of the
control volume, okay?

1087
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:54,939
So here, let's say
this is my liquid.

1088
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:57,019
Here's my block.

1089
00:43:57,019 --> 00:43:59,779
I want to draw one
control volume,

1090
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:02,300
which is just
around the block.

1091
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,739
So let's call
this as CV one.

1092
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:07,580
And the second
control volume

1093
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,979
that I would like to draw

1094
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:13,859
is everything that
contains the liquid, okay?

1095
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:19,239
All right. This is
kind of a mess.

1096
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,760
They took my blue marker.

1097
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,639
So this is what you're
left with, right?

1098
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:23,959
And so this part that has

1099
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,159
the water is
basically CV two.

1100
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:27,999
So we can call
this as water, and

1101
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,359
we can call this as iron,

1102
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,119
right? All right.

1103
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:35,999
So if I want to write

1104
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:39,159
my conservation of
energy equation,

1105
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,919
I would like to
first start with

1106
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:42,999
the combined
system, right?

1107
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:44,639
So I'm going to
write my change in

1108
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:46,959
energy from my
combined system.

1109
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:50,439
So the Delta E CV one

1110
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:56,480
plus CV two is
equal to the EN

1111
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,599
of CV one plus

1112
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,439
CV two minus E

1113
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:10,399
out of CV one plus
CV two. All right?

1114
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:12,960
You know, we're
going to neglect

1115
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,159
kinetic and
potential energy.

1116
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:15,439
Even if I drop
the rock in,

1117
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:16,719
let's say now
it's, you know,

1118
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:19,999
we're not it
wasn't, you know,

1119
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,359
I wasn't throwing
it, you know,

1120
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:24,439
Justin Berland or slinging
it at that thing.

1121
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:25,679
So basically, you
just, you know,

1122
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:27,639
you kind of you
put it in there.

1123
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:30,199
And so what you'll
have then is,

1124
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:33,299
we'll say that the
Delta U All right,

1125
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:36,259
four CV one plus CV two.

1126
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:37,460
So the change in internal

1127
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,059
energy is then equal to

1128
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:45,579
our W in plus our

1129
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:50,899
Q in of CV one plus
CV two minus or

1130
00:45:50,899 --> 00:45:57,219
plus a negative of
W out plus Q out,

1131
00:45:57,219 --> 00:46:00,819
CV one plus CV two, right?

1132
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:02,179
And what I'm going

1133
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:03,139
to say is for
this process,

1134
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:05,379
when I look at the
combined control volumes,

1135
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:06,859
do you see any work or

1136
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:08,099
heat transfer happening

1137
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,164
to this combined system?

1138
00:46:10,164 --> 00:46:12,269
All right, on
the sixth row,

1139
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,269
I see a head shake.

1140
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:15,509
I like that. So
no. All right.

1141
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:19,670
So there's no worker
heat transfer

1142
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,509
in and no worker
heat transferred

1143
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:23,629
out to the combined
one, okay?

1144
00:46:23,629 --> 00:46:25,389
There is heat
transfer, of course,

1145
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:26,469
that's going to take
place between the

1146
00:46:26,469 --> 00:46:27,869
hot rock and
the cold water.

1147
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,389
But if I look at
the combined thing,

1148
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:30,589
it's adiabatic, right?

1149
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:32,909
And I have no work
happening, right?

1150
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:34,989
So this Delta U, right?

1151
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,029
Delta U of CV

1152
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:40,909
one plus CV two
is equal to zero.

1153
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:53,339
All right. I Yeah,

1154
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:54,699
which is the other way

1155
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:56,019
to write this is that
I could just say

1156
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:59,979
that Delta U
of CV one plus

1157
00:46:59,979 --> 00:47:04,859
Delta U of CV two
is equal to zero,

1158
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:05,059
right,

1159
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,419
because these things
are additive, right?

1160
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:07,779
This is an extensive
property, right?

1161
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:08,859
It depends on how
much is there.

1162
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,939
So I can add the
internal energy of the

1163
00:47:10,939 --> 00:47:13,859
CV one to the internal
energy of the CV two.

1164
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:15,139
That's the combined one,

1165
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:16,499
and as I showed you there,

1166
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:17,539
or as you said,

1167
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:20,019
that there's zero
change, okay?

1168
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:22,139
All right, for an
incompressible,

1169
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,500
for our solid,
for our solid,

1170
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,539
what I showed on
the slide before,

1171
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:31,939
is that right dU is
equal to CV All right,

1172
00:47:31,939 --> 00:47:39,219
CV of T times
times dt, right?

1173
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:41,619
We can integrate this
from state one to two.

1174
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:43,939
We assume it's a constant,

1175
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:47,379
specific heat, and we
can say then, right,

1176
00:47:47,379 --> 00:47:53,379
this is Cv times T
two minus T one,

1177
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:57,379
iron, right? F, okay?

1178
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,899
And again, we have
free choice as to what

1179
00:48:01,899 --> 00:48:03,539
in a sense as to
what temperature

1180
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:04,779
we take the
specific heat at.

1181
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:06,299
But as you'll see
in the textbook,

1182
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:07,059
I believe this one's

1183
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:09,299
only for room temperature.

1184
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:11,459
And as I said
before, the value

1185
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:12,700
that's given is a CP,

1186
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,939
and for a solid CV
is CP, alright?

1187
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,529
Cool.

1188
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:22,529
Yeah, so then the

1189
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:23,769
change in the
internal energy

1190
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:26,809
then of our CV one.

1191
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:28,649
Just give me a second,
and then we're done.

1192
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:30,449
I have the mass of

1193
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:35,129
the iron times the
specific heat of my iron,

1194
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:36,489
and then that's
going to be times

1195
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:39,769
T two minus t1f.

1196
00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:41,689
Okay. And with that,
I'm going to close it.

1197
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:43,409
We'll pick up in
the next lecture

1198
00:48:43,409 --> 00:48:45,570
then with our second
control volume.

1199
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,169
If you have questions,

1200
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:48,009
I'm up here. Thank you.
