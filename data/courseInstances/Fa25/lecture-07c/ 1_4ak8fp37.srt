1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,360
I got 210 entropy.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,960
Yeah, so basically, we're

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,080
going to look
at some aspects

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
of change in entropy
ideal gases.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,480
We're going to
look at especially

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,640
in the isentropic process.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,239
These have two
examples today and

8
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,159
show you how that's
useful for, like,

9
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:20,839
understanding work
in or workout

10
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,240
of steady flow
devices, all right?

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,840
Then we'll also
derive some

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,439
deriving equation.

13
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,759
All right. So an
isentropic process, right?

14
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,789
So before We had this,

15
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,429
we said changes in

16
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,069
entropy were equal to

17
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,709
an amount of heat
transferred in,

18
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:40,790
divided by temperature,
and amount of heat

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,510
transferred out divided
by temperature.

20
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,309
So the first part of
calling something like

21
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,229
isotropic is that there's
no heat transfer.

22
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,989
That's step one.
The second thing

23
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,389
is imagine that

24
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,149
the device operates
reversibly,

25
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,029
no friction, right?

26
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,510
You don't have
anything that's

27
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,669
very far from equilibrium.

28
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:05,909
So if you see
something like, Hey,

29
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,775
this is adiabatic
and it's reversible,

30
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:10,439
that should trigger
something in

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,479
your head to say
isotropic, right?

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,640
So those are keywords

33
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,399
that allow you
to be there.

34
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,359
But an adiabatic
process is not

35
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,919
necessarily an isotropic
process, okay?

36
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:23,320
And the same for something
like reversible.

37
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,400
A device could be
operating reversibly,

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,680
but I could be
transferring

39
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,039
heat into it, okay?

40
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,399
And that second one
we'll classify and

41
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,800
call is actually we'll
give a terminology,

42
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,079
and I'll call that
one as, like,

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,960
what's called
internally reversible.

44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,000
This whole thing operates

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,400
perfectly and reversibly,

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,999
but maybe I'm
adding heat or

47
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,439
taking heat out
of it, okay?

48
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,599
Um, All right,

49
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,999
so that's the part about
isentropic, right?

50
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,039
The second thing
is that entropy

51
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,879
is a property, right?

52
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,240
So just like enthropy,

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,719
if I think about a
fluid, so if you look

54
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,200
up here at this, if I
think about the fluid,

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,999
the fluid can have
a property of

56
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,199
an enthropy when it

57
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,200
enters an internal energy,

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,160
a pressure,
specific volume,

59
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,040
and also an entropy.

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,199
So it can have an
entropy, right?

61
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,759
And when something
is, let's

62
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,159
say in this steady
flow device,

63
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,159
if this is operating
isentropically,

64
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,600
the entropy
specific entropy

65
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,840
of the steam entering here

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,320
is going to be equal to

67
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,185
the specific entropy
of the steam leaving.

68
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:23,250
And that is very,
very useful, okay?

69
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,050
This is going to
make it possible for

70
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,010
us in very, like,

71
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,810
easy ways to analyze

72
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,210
power plants and
devices later, okay?

73
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,929
And again, just to
remind you before,

74
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:35,130
when something is
operating like this,

75
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,010
this is the
theoretical limit

76
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,810
of performance, right?
So we're doing this.

77
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,570
We're thinking about
theoretical limits.

78
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,810
Later on, we'll talk

79
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,690
about some ways and

80
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,970
account for the
fact that things,

81
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,210
you know, life is
imperfect, okay?

82
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,529
So we'll account
for that later.

83
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:50,775
But today, life's perfect.

84
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:53,500
Cool. So an example.

85
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,740
So here I'm showing

86
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,899
you a very
important device.

87
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:58,380
This is a turbine, right?

88
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,780
So this is what you
would see, again,

89
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,420
you know, here,

90
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,820
the work transferred
out here.

91
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,660
What would be what is
transferred to, like,

92
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,740
a generator and
electricity production

93
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,880
in a thermoelectric
power plant.

94
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,699
You're given inlets.

95
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,059
So this is
superheated steam.

96
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,300
That's a high
pressure, and

97
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,459
that's a very
high temperature.

98
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,939
So you have superheated
steam that's

99
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,580
entering here,

100
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,659
work transferred out,
no heat transferred in,

101
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,780
and, you know, the
outlet pressure.

102
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,740
And this is a reversible
adiabatic turbine,

103
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:27,940
right?

104
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,140
So the entropy of

105
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,700
the fluid specific
entropy of

106
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,900
the fluid exiting
is equal here.

107
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,410
What does that look
like on a TS diagram?

108
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,920
So here you have the
saturated shinom

109
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,440
on a TS diagram, so
temperature entropy.

110
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,160
Here you are at
high pressure,

111
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,000
and then dropping
to the low, again,

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,599
along this line of
constant entropy.

113
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,799
When you leave
here, you're still

114
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,119
a superheated vapor.

115
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,319
So let's get into
it. All right.

116
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,310
Okay.

117
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,299
I'm not going to
redraw the diagram.

118
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,020
You see here where
the control volume,

119
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,619
where the control
volume is

120
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,100
defined at state
one entering

121
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,299
and state two exiting.

122
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:05,579
All right. And here,

123
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,220
the goal that we want
to get out is the work

124
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,820
transferred out
per unit mass.

125
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,459
So what we're calling

126
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,860
is W out here is equal to

127
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,580
W dot out divided by

128
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,979
the mass flow rate of
this entering, right?

129
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,180
I have one inlet, I have

130
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,379
one exit, right there.

131
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,340
Okay? So what we assume,

132
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,269
is that we can neglect
All right, KE and P,

133
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:38,949
similar elect
kinetic energy

134
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,829
and potential
energy changes,

135
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:42,749
so Delta KE and

136
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,989
Delta P. Let me

137
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,790
make sure that
looks good. Um.

138
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,469
We cannot treat this as

139
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:54,950
an ideal gas properties
determined from

140
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,510
Pi K. We're not
going to apply

141
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,829
the ideal gas equation
to a steam turbine.

142
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:02,989
We're going to assume
it's reversible, right?

143
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:06,030
So it's a
reversible process,

144
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,949
reversible plus
adiabatic, okay?

145
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:13,189
Adiabatic, which

146
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:16,190
basically implies
that it's isotropic.

147
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,430
All right, that
steady flow.

148
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,149
It's a steady flow device,

149
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:23,070
steady flow,

150
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,589
right, which means
that, you know,

151
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,349
changes in the mass

152
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:27,989
of the control
volume is zero,

153
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,909
and changes in
the energy of

154
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,149
the control volume is
also equal to zero.

155
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:36,910
And we'll switch over.
This marker is dead.

156
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,789
We'll move over
into red now.

157
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:45,569
I All right.

158
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:47,529
We have a single inlet
and outlet, right?

159
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:53,169
Single inlet plus
outlet there.

160
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,089
All right? Cool.

161
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,210
So our physical laws,

162
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,089
the physical laws that

163
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:57,930
we'll write here, right?

164
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,010
So the first is the
conservation of mass.

165
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,884
So dmCv dt right
is equal to m.in.

166
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:07,559
Minus M dot out.

167
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,960
Let me see how that looks.

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,279
That looks pretty good.

169
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,799
M dot out, because

170
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,880
this is steady flow,

171
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,439
this is going
to go to zero.

172
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,359
And what this implies is

173
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,680
that dot is equal to m.in,

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,559
which is equal to M dot

175
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,320
out to do the same thing

176
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,759
for the conservation
of energy,

177
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:31,559
dcvdt is equal to
e.in minus E dot out.

178
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,639
Steady flow this
goes to zero.

179
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,200
So your e.in is equal to

180
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:44,219
your E dot out
there. Yeah.

181
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,619
All right. Underneath
this. All right.

182
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,139
So the ways we can
transfer energy in again,

183
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,020
write w.in plus our
q.in plus our M dot.

184
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,300
Remember this is m.in,

185
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,299
but that's equal to
M dot, Enthal P one,

186
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:00,140
state one is entering
plus velocity

187
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,259
one squared divided
by two plus gz one,

188
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,819
the potential energy is

189
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,419
equal to your W dot out,

190
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,434
plus your Q dot out.

191
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:10,089
Plus M dot out,

192
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:12,449
which is just M
dot, enthalpy two,

193
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,690
which is at the
exit velocity two

194
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,849
squared divided
by two, gz two.

195
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,050
Kinetic terms are gone,

196
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,610
adiabatic heat
terms are gone,

197
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,249
and we don't have work in.

198
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:28,290
This is workout. O W dot
out here is equal to

199
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,569
our M dot times H
one minus H two.

200
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,289
You can check if
this makes sense.

201
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,649
You would expect
the enthalpy

202
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:37,649
of the steam entering

203
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,250
the turbine to be higher
than that exiting.

204
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,009
There's basically
more energy in

205
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,209
the steam when
it's coming in

206
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:44,370
and you want to
extract that.

207
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,009
H one should be
greater than H two.

208
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,049
We have the M dot. What
we're interested in,

209
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:51,450
though, is W dot out
divided by M dot.

210
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,650
So if we then
take that dot,

211
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,609
and we shift it to
the other side,

212
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,249
right? That's what
we have, right?

213
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:01,369
So the work
transferred out on

214
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:03,929
a per mass basis
from the turbine is

215
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,769
equal to the
difference from

216
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,409
the enthalpy at the inlet.

217
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,169
Basically the
enthropy at the inlet

218
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,049
minus the enthropy at
the exit there, right?

219
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:15,369
So that's super,
super simple, right?

220
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,889
But we know H one.

221
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,089
So let's talk about
some properties here.

222
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:27,249
So H one state
one State one,

223
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:34,169
we know P one is equal
to our five MPA.

224
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,090
We know that T
one is equal to

225
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,930
our 450 degrees
C. And from this,

226
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,610
we can get enthropy one

227
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,050
and also entropy
one, okay?

228
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,729
So the specific enthropy

229
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:49,129
and the specific entropy.

230
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:53,340
So for State two, All

231
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,179
we know is the pressure.

232
00:08:55,179 --> 00:09:00,379
Right now, P two is
equal to 1.4 MPA?

233
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:03,860
And S two specific
enthalpy at state

234
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,259
two is equal to

235
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,140
the specific enthalpy
at state one, okay?

236
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,699
Because this is isotropic.

237
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,100
And this is not
complete information.

238
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,340
So pressure with
specific entropy

239
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,860
means that I also then

240
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,020
know enthalpy two, right?

241
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,620
You can use PKolor,
plug this in.

242
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,940
There was a question
before about

243
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,980
what unit if you

244
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,499
want to put this in for

245
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:26,460
Picor, how could
you declare this?

246
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,899
So if I said
something like,

247
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,979
let's say, Um, right?

248
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:35,420
Maybe ST two is equal
to h dot state,

249
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,540
all of my substance.

250
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,060
So here I'd have
water. All right.

251
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,700
Right? I have my
P. So the P here

252
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,859
is then equal to
what is that?

253
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,420
That's 1.4 comma.

254
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,900
And you can put in
quotes M PA and for S,

255
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,620
if you wanted to put
that in here, right,

256
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,740
you could just
put in the value

257
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,260
that you would
have for S two.

258
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,820
So we get S two.

259
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,459
And then in here, it
would be kilojoules.

260
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,700
It's basically a
little K. So you'd

261
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,300
have, um, All right.

262
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Kilojoules per

263
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,139
kilogram space
Kelvin like that.

264
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:15,380
All right. I'll update

265
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,780
this later in
the readme file,

266
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,860
but you can also declare
units for this for

267
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,220
enthalpy, like that, okay?

268
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,380
So you'd have this,
you'd have the H two.

269
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,740
And then when you
substitute you

270
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,060
can go in and substitute
some numbers.

271
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,140
So if we substitute it
then write this W dot

272
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,220
out divided by M

273
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,980
dot being equal to
H one minus H two.

274
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,779
What I have as
a value is 350,

275
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,820
then kilojoules per
kilogram as an answer.

276
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,340
The thing to reflect
on is, again,

277
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,379
that this is adiabatic
and reversible,

278
00:10:58,379 --> 00:10:59,540
and that allows
you then to

279
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,060
set the entropies
equal and

280
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,740
determine state two,
namely enthalpy two.

281
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,235
Cool. Questions
about that?

282
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,889
And that's why you
care about entropy

283
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:12,370
because it makes
it easy, right?

284
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,010
This makes it easy to
analyze and at least

285
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,930
understand what will be

286
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,090
maximum performance
that can

287
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,770
be had out of your device.

288
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,850
Yes, please.

289
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,550
Define so let me just
be clear, right?

290
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,309
So if I define right,

291
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:37,990
if I define state one,

292
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,110
what I'm defining in Pi or

293
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,990
is an object called
ST one, right?

294
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,350
So if I define
ST one, right,

295
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,229
S one is equal to
St one dots, right?

296
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:50,550
And then if I
know that, then

297
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,190
I just put it in.

298
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,750
So you could
also just write,

299
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,870
you know, St
one dots here.

300
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,909
And then what you need
to understand is that

301
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,030
the default unit of this

302
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,270
is like what's
in the textbook,

303
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,710
which is kilojoules
per kilogram kelvin.

304
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,989
So the outputs are set,

305
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,390
but then you
can convert to

306
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,310
whatever unit would
you would want,

307
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,070
and then you would just

308
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,030
declare what that unit

309
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,155
is if you want it
as an input, okay?

310
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:12,720
Or just default and say,

311
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,199
Hey, you know, I
live dangerously.

312
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,599
I'm just going to
put kilojoules

313
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,919
per kilogram per kelvin.

314
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,920
I know that,
I'm just going

315
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,000
to write it
without the unit.

316
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
But I advise
always write in

317
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,280
the unit because you

318
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,440
get to reflect and think,

319
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
you know, am I

320
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,040
doing the right
thing? All right.

321
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,840
Other questions?

322
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,840
Great. So now,
a derivation.

323
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,850
So everything that
I just showed

324
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,650
you right there
is enough to

325
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,410
now start analyzing so

326
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,689
I just showed you
the vapor cycle.

327
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,329
And with that approach

328
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:10,210
that I just showed you,

329
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,450
it's totally valid to

330
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,490
analyze air cycles
the same way,

331
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,929
compressors and
that, right?

332
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,730
So you can use Pi
killer and do it.

333
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,530
What I'm going to
do now is something

334
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,370
that for ideal gases

335
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,169
allows you not to

336
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,490
need property
tables, right?

337
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,570
And this basically
develops out of the fact

338
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,130
that before it was

339
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,010
a pain in the neck to,

340
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,849
like, look up properties.

341
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:33,250
So if you read
the book chapter,

342
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,570
we're going to talk about
these things called

343
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,209
TDS relation.

344
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,890
So I'm going to see if
I can find a black.

345
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,810
Nope, they took everything.
That's awesome.

346
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,649
Okay. That is, like,
empty. That's amazing.

347
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:50,090
It's amazing. Here we go.

348
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,890
The goods. All right.

349
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,330
That's better. Okay.

350
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:04,070
Um Yeah, so the context
of this is think this

351
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,109
is going to be a
useful formula

352
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,710
that may make my life

353
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,430
even easier
when I analyze,

354
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,830
like, compressors, jet
engines, gas turbines.

355
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,190
That's the
mindset they have

356
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,429
for the following
derivation.

357
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:28,319
Okay, so entropy
differential relations.

358
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,960
Okay, do. Okay.

359
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,080
So before I get into

360
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,159
the first step of this is,

361
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,200
we want to show is

362
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,880
basically for
an ideal gas,

363
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,919
that for an
isotropic process,

364
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,679
we can relate things
like temperature,

365
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,159
pressure and
specific volume.

366
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,479
So think like
a compressor.

367
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,680
I know the temperature

368
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,920
and the pressure upstream.

369
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,519
I know the pressure
downstream.

370
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,159
I would like to know

371
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,040
the temperature
downstream, okay?

372
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,760
There's going to be
a formula for that.

373
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,159
And why do I care
about temperatures?

374
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,480
Because differences
in enthalpy

375
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,680
for an ideal gas are what?

376
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,689
You're going to do amazing

377
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,489
on quiiz one. Yes, please.

378
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,570
That's it. Functions
of temperature.

379
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,010
So if I get
Delta Ts across

380
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,970
these devices with
a constant CP,

381
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,530
I know changes
in enthal peak.

382
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,690
Bang bang, okay? So
that's the mindset.

383
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,010
It's going to be a
tool that allows you

384
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,409
to rapidly get
the temperatures

385
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:26,970
upstream or downstream
of a device. Okay.

386
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,690
Step one. Now, I told
you before, right,

387
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,010
that dq divided by

388
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:40,849
T was by definition,
equal to ds.

389
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:44,035
And that is true
for these devices.

390
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:46,500
If they don't

391
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,700
themselves generate
entropy, okay?

392
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,980
So remember, if I take

393
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,100
a device and I have a lot

394
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,220
of friction there, right?

395
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,860
I'm going to be

396
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,220
generating entropy
from that, right?

397
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,299
I'm going to
heat from that

398
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,659
heat's going to be
transferred in,

399
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,660
it's going to be a
mess, all right?

400
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,620
So to calculate, then

401
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,860
the change in entropy
for such a device,

402
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,060
when I add heat to
it or take heat out,

403
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,299
I'm going to call
this as internally

404
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,340
reversible, all right?

405
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,940
So the device can have
changes in entropy,

406
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,660
but those changes in

407
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,300
entropy are only
going to be due to me

408
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,180
bringing heat in
or heat out and

409
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,460
not due to friction, okay?

410
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,539
Stay with me.

411
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,619
Maybe the weirdest part

412
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:21,380
of the course, all right?

413
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,099
I got two subscripts.

414
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:25,220
Um, So, yeah,

415
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,699
an internally
reversible process

416
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,259
is one without
irreversibility.

417
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:31,420
So no friction within
the device, right?

418
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,900
So if this is like a
compressor within here,

419
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,780
everything is
isothermal, right?

420
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,820
So I have no friction
inside of this.

421
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,220
It's reversible, right?

422
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,619
This is my happy place,
okay? That's in here.

423
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,420
Any temperature differences
in all of that,

424
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,699
all that stuff exists
outside of my boundary.

425
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,699
That's the meaning
of internally, um,

426
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,660
uh, uh, reversible, okay?

427
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,960
All right. So that's
the first thing.

428
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,760
Now we'll start with

429
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,600
the first first law here.

430
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,080
All right.

431
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,479
So the first law for
this then is going to be

432
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:07,359
the change in
internal energy is

433
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,559
equal to the change in
heat transferred for

434
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,400
an internally
reversible process

435
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,840
minus the change in
the work transferred,

436
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,520
also for an internally
reversible process,

437
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,159
okay?

438
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,799
And for, like, a
simple system,

439
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,159
so think of like
a piston, right?

440
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,440
So if we think
about a piston,

441
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,199
you know, no
mass in or out,

442
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,830
um, And this piston,

443
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,750
let's say the substance

444
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,669
in there is compressible.

445
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:34,790
Let's say it's like air,

446
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,230
right? It's an ideal gas.

447
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,429
The only kind of work
that this can do

448
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,469
is PDV work, okay?

449
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:44,309
So if it's
reversible, right,

450
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,805
it would be PDV, right?

451
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,820
You can think about
other types of work like

452
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,940
electrical work
transferred

453
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,100
in, but that's
not reversible.

454
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,379
I pass electrons
through that.

455
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm going to get heat.

456
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,659
That's not reversible.
So the only kind

457
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,259
of work then there
I can do for

458
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:01,099
a simple compressible
system is P PdV.

459
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,219
This from the
formula up here then

460
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:07,099
is nothing but TDS

461
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,740
we're going to write
d is an equal to TdS

462
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,819
minus PdV

463
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:17,059
for an internally
reversible process.

464
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,919
Do, do, do. We can
rearrange this,

465
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:32,080
and we say ds is
equal to d plus P dv.

466
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,799
We can divide both
sides by mass,

467
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,919
and then I can write
this as dS is equal to

468
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:45,039
d plus P d little
V. All right.

469
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,239
There's two forms that
we're going to use.

470
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,760
So this is one that's
going to be useful.

471
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,639
We have another one
that involves enthalpy.

472
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:55,129
So for that,
let's say recall.

473
00:18:55,129 --> 00:19:01,100
Recall that H is
equal to U plus pv.

474
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,059
If I take the
differential of this,

475
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,899
I can have d is equal

476
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,659
to dh is equal to d plus

477
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:13,299
P dv plus V dp, some
chain rule there.

478
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:16,459
If I rearrange this
as a function of d,

479
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,940
I can then do a
substitution.

480
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,019
So d is equal to

481
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:26,630
dh minus pdv minus
V dp. All right.

482
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,349
Substitute that
into there,

483
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:32,229
and I can have then
T ds is equal to

484
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:40,510
d minus pdv minus
V dp plus pdv.

485
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:45,509
And so it's going
to go away, right?

486
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:47,229
This is going to go,

487
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,949
and then this
is going to go.

488
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:51,869
And so then our
Tds relation,

489
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:54,270
another one will be ds

490
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,830
is equal to dh minus V dp.

491
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:12,789
The All right.

492
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:14,549
And so what's nice
about this is right,

493
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,510
changes in entropy, right,

494
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,549
which we can't
measure, right?

495
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:21,309
So ds is then going to
be related to things

496
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:22,630
that might be knowable

497
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,149
or might be able to
be looked up, right?

498
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:28,310
DH divided by T minus V dp

499
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,069
also divided by T. Okay?

500
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,350
So for the ideal
gas, so remember,

501
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,150
the type of system we're

502
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,589
interested in here
compressible system,

503
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,309
a simple
compressible system.

504
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,549
And at this point,
we're going

505
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:44,790
to declare ideal gas.

506
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,430
So for an ideal
gas, um, right?

507
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,869
We know that changes in

508
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:55,870
enthalpy are
equal to Cp dt.

509
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,629
And the substitution
that I want to

510
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,629
make is going to be

511
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,149
for specific
volume, right?

512
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:07,589
So then I know
that pv equals RT,

513
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:10,949
so that means V is equal
to RT divided by P,

514
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:15,470
where R is the specific
gas constant, right?

515
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:20,419
So dh into here,
and V into there.

516
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:21,899
And so what you'll
have then is

517
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:23,659
ds is equal to

518
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,539
cp dt divided by

519
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,339
T. We can integrate
that now,

520
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:31,859
and then minus, right,

521
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:37,419
Rt divided by P times V

522
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:41,579
divided by T
dp, all right?

523
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,049
Temperatures go
away. And again,

524
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:52,089
this is, what
did I do wrong?

525
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:53,610
What did I do
wrong? I should

526
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,890
not have a V because I

527
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,730
substituted in
for V, right?

528
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,249
So I substitute
to VRT by P.

529
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:01,929
The one over T
stays there with

530
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,689
the dp and so what
you in the end

531
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:08,409
then is R let me just
write it out ds is

532
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:14,489
equal to Cp dt
divided by T minus R,

533
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:19,169
dp divided by P, okay?

534
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,599
And then we can
integrate, right?

535
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:25,359
So we can basically
integrate this.

536
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,680
This is straightforward.

537
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,559
Let's say from state
one to state two.

538
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,920
R is a constant,

539
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,959
so I can pull
that out of the

540
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,719
integral from P
one to P two.

541
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,080
And then here, we have to

542
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,479
make a decision, right?

543
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,559
So I could write the
integral like this.

544
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,959
Specifically does
depend on temperature,

545
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,800
not very strongly
in the regions that

546
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,919
we care about in this
class, but it does.

547
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,119
So I can integrate
this 1-2.

548
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,639
And then what I
would have to do is

549
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,439
I'd have to take an
average value, right,

550
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,159
or I'd have to
essentially have CP

551
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:53,719
as a function of

552
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,619
temperature and
integrate, right?

553
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,679
We're practical
people, okay?

554
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,080
And I'm an engineer,

555
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,360
and I like things
to be easy,

556
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,960
at least in my
first attempt.

557
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,639
So I'll say this.

558
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,639
And then what you'll
do is you'll just say

559
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,480
that the CP is a constant.

560
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,800
I like to take the value

561
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,840
of the specific heats at

562
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,239
the temperature
that I start from.

563
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,799
A lot of times
in this class,

564
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,119
you're going to
hear us take

565
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,639
essentially this value at

566
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,040
room temperature
condition.

567
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,479
For engines, we call that

568
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,360
the cold air assumption,

569
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,599
cold air assumption there.

570
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,079
So you just do that
because we want

571
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,959
life to be easy, right?

572
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,759
And so with that
integration, right,

573
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,319
I'm going to have S one or

574
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,819
S two minus little S one.

575
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:39,079
Is equal to cp,
the natural log

576
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,439
of T two divided by T one

577
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:45,519
minus the specific gas
constant R times P

578
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,559
two divided by P
one, all right?

579
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,999
And that's our first
relation there, okay.

580
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,839
Okay, we can also

581
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,440
remember that for
an ideal gas,

582
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,400
the d is equal to CV dt.

583
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,080
Let me see. Am I
off the board?

584
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,760
I think I'm off the board.

585
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,120
CV dt.

586
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,359
Let me at the state,
I'll turn that off.

587
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,400
Okay. So CV dt.

588
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,319
And instead of
writing this as

589
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,200
a function of a
specific volume,

590
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,479
I can do it for
pressure, right?

591
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:36,440
P is equal to rt divided
by specific volume.

592
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:43,639
Okay. Okay. So if I
have the TDS, right?

593
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:48,920
So if we have
the Tds relation

594
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,119
that is here, so
that original one.

595
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,999
So what I can
say is the Tds T

596
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:57,240
d little S is equal
to d plus pdv.

597
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,719
So the d is then
Cv dt plus P dv.

598
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,160
So the P here then is

599
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,519
R T divided by V dv, okay?

600
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,360
You can divide both
sides by temperature.

601
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,679
So T, T and T.

602
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,120
And if we do that,
this T is gone.

603
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,079
All right. And of course,

604
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,239
this T is also
gone. All right.

605
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:32,679
And so we'll have ds
is equal to Cv dt by

606
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,799
T plus R dv

607
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,169
by V. Can integrate
from state one to two.

608
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:43,449
Here. Again, I could
write the integral here,

609
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:45,129
but today I want
life to be easy.

610
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,649
This is the happy place,

611
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:48,529
stay one to two here,

612
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:51,369
and then R is a constant.
This is one to two.

613
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:54,129
And so then little S
two minus little S

614
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:57,089
one is equal to
CV natural log

615
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,169
of T two by T

616
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:03,050
one plus a specific
gas constant,

617
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,209
natural log of V two
divided by V one.

618
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,490
That's our
second relation.

619
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:18,909
All right. All right.

620
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:22,910
And so what you do next,

621
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,189
again, because we're
interested in, right,

622
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:25,789
as I said before,

623
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,509
we're going to
assume isentropic.

624
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:28,830
And with isentropic,

625
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,910
I'm going to be
able to rate

626
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,069
temperature to volume
from state one

627
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:34,590
to state two,
temperature to pressure.

628
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,269
And with those
two equations,

629
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:37,790
pressure to volume.

630
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,749
So what we're going to do

631
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:39,749
is we're going
to set S two

632
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:42,699
minus S one, two,
Zero, right?

633
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,260
That's great.
Took the words

634
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,619
out of my mouth. I
like that, right?

635
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,579
So if we do that four,

636
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,339
so we can start with our

637
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,739
temperature and
pressure one.

638
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:53,499
So if we do that,

639
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,019
right, we're
going to have CP,

640
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:59,299
natural log of T two by T

641
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:03,900
one is equal to
specific gas constant,

642
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:10,459
natural log of P two
divided by P one, right?

643
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,340
You can divide
both sides by CP?

644
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,259
I could write
here, R divided by

645
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:20,300
CP gets rid of that.

646
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,500
And because this is a uh,

647
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,459
uh, write a
coefficient here,

648
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:25,939
this is essentially
the same as R

649
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:29,764
divided by CP, okay?

650
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:31,829
And because now it's a

651
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:33,630
natural log on both sides,

652
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,789
natural log can
now go away, okay?

653
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,029
So what you're left
with then is T two by T

654
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,390
one is equal to

655
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,389
pressure two divided
by pressure one,

656
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:44,989
gas constant divided
by specific heat.

657
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:47,069
And we can do
the same thing

658
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:49,069
for our other
formula, right?

659
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:52,989
So CV, natural log of T

660
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,909
two divided by T one

661
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:57,869
is equal then to
the negative of R,

662
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:02,629
natural log of V two
divided by V one.

663
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,129
Okay, we divide
this by CV.

664
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:13,769
So both sides we
can divide by

665
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:16,130
CV. So this goes away.

666
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,890
It's a natural log,

667
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,329
I can put this to
the exponent, right?

668
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:24,610
So I can go negative
R divided by CV.

669
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,249
All right. And now I
have natural logs.

670
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:33,770
So now natural
logs can go away.

671
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,089
So I have one
relation, I have two.

672
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,649
And because T two by

673
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,729
T one is equal
to here, right?

674
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:42,489
I can have them
be equal, okay?

675
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:44,650
So the take
home message is

676
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,489
for the isotropic
processes, right?

677
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:48,370
It can relate upstream

678
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,209
and downstream, you know,

679
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:52,090
let's say, the ratio

680
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,369
the temperatures
upstream and

681
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:54,569
downstream to ratios of

682
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:56,169
the pressures to some
constants, right?

683
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,610
So properties
that we assume,

684
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,450
let's say, at T one.

685
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,929
The same thing
for temperatures

686
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:02,210
to specific volumes.

687
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,289
And because these two are

688
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:04,370
the same on the
left hand side,

689
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,489
you can go pressures to

690
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,050
specific volumes
as well, right?

691
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:07,690
And the name of

692
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,969
the game in this
analysis, though,

693
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:10,529
is usually to get to
temperatures because

694
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:12,890
differences in temperatures
in compressors,

695
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,529
gas turbines tells us

696
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:16,729
differences in enthalpy,
which tells us what?

697
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:17,889
Work in, work out.

698
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,010
That's what you
care about.

699
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,314
All right?

700
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:24,140
Cool. You can do
some simplification.

701
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,339
I'm going to spare
you it here.

702
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,820
If you click on, you know,

703
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,020
if you click on the link

704
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,379
there, it can take
you through it.

705
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:33,439
But, um, convenient
ways that we can,

706
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,599
um, represent this
are the following.

707
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,559
The first is
that instead of

708
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,600
writing things
like R and CV,

709
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,119
we can recognize
that R is equal

710
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,679
to Cp minus CV, right?

711
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,480
That's the first thing.
So the specific heat

712
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,240
at constant pressure minus

713
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,320
the specific heat for

714
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,040
constant volume is equal
to the gas constant.

715
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,879
The second thing is
that we're going to

716
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,959
talk about a constant K,

717
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,639
which is then Cp
divided by CV?

718
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:04,400
This is the
adiabatic index.

719
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,559
This came up before
when we were

720
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,119
doing adiabatic
expansion, right?

721
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,840
So this is, um,
the same constant.

722
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,439
If you read other things

723
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:12,799
other than your textbook,

724
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,160
things on the Internet,

725
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,159
sometimes this
adiabatic index is

726
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,400
also written with a
variable Gamma there,

727
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,919
but the book uses K or

728
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,839
Kappa for that, all right?

729
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,519
So again, with

730
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,120
some math and
some rearranging,

731
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,280
which you can have then
are the following.

732
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,439
So T two divided by T one,

733
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:40,429
is equal to P two
divided by P one

734
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:43,910
to the K minus

735
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,150
one divided by a minus
one divided by Kappa,

736
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:52,749
there T two
divided by T one

737
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:58,109
is equal to V one
divided by V two,

738
00:30:58,109 --> 00:31:00,870
and then this
is to the Kapa

739
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,704
minus one minus one,

740
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:04,739
And then, again, if
you set these things

741
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,900
equal and you rearrange,

742
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,299
what you can
show is that P

743
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:12,219
two divided by
P one is equal

744
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:15,259
to V one divided by V

745
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:19,824
two to the K or
Kappa. All right.

746
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:24,309
More generally, again, you

747
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:26,989
could rearrange this to be

748
00:31:26,989 --> 00:31:28,349
that all on one side would

749
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:30,109
be temperature
one pressure one,

750
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:31,029
all on the other side is

751
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:32,629
temperature two
pressure two,

752
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,589
or in the case of
something like the PV,

753
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:36,189
like we did for the
adiabatic problem,

754
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:39,869
I could put p1v1 to

755
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:41,069
the K on the
left hand side,

756
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,790
and it's equal
to a constant.

757
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,950
What this implies here
is that pressure,

758
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,150
volume to the K is
equal to a constant,

759
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,629
as we did before, but

760
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:52,399
you could also
show from this.

761
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,089
What we did not show

762
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:56,329
before are the other two.

763
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:59,609
So temperature
times pressure to

764
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,929
the one minus K

765
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:07,290
divided by K is also
equal to a constant.

766
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,569
And temperature times
specific volume to

767
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:13,649
the K minus one is also

768
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:17,289
equal to a constant,
all right?

769
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,769
And again, these hold

770
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:25,129
four ideal gases
and right,

771
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:30,649
ist isentropic
processes, okay?

772
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,670
And these will be useful

773
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,189
when we do things
like I said,

774
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:38,149
the gas turbine analysis,

775
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:40,470
which is called
Brayton cycles

776
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,989
when we get into
the jet propulsion,

777
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:45,189
especially the
temperature and

778
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:46,709
the pressure ratio here.

779
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:50,310
That's that's a
pretty handy formula.

780
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,189
Questions about
that? Yes, please.

781
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,149
What do you think?

782
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,559
I mean, some molecules
have more than that.

783
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,199
Some things are
also solid, right?

784
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:07,959
Yeah. Yes, of
course, it depends.

785
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,279
CP here, right?

786
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,839
So this CP is our units

787
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,159
of kilojoules
per kilogram.

788
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,399
Kelvin the same
for the CV.

789
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,959
Yeah, that definitely
depends on

790
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,319
the substance, and
you can call this.

791
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,280
So remember before
we did Pi kilo.

792
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,719
So if you had, let's say,

793
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,240
a state one defined,

794
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,960
if you went dot CP or
you did St dot CV,

795
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,280
it will spit out
these constants.

796
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,519
So you can call this,

797
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,200
and then if you just
take the ratio of them,

798
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,359
you have the Adiabatic
index from it, okay?

799
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,039
The questions? Good. Yes,

800
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,360
please. Just to clarify.

801
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,120
Yeah, so the units of
this are kilojoules

802
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,599
per kilogram
Kelvin, right?

803
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,440
Which here would
mean that it is.

804
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,119
If you wanted to

805
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,360
convert that to
the universal,

806
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,800
you would know

807
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,240
the molecular weight
of your substance,

808
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,279
and you could
recover R, okay?

809
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,759
Maybe since we're on the

810
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,079
subject of talking
about this,

811
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,679
you can also see the
following, right?

812
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,199
You can see the universal
gas constant being

813
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,760
written to the
specific heat

814
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,120
on a molar basis,

815
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,679
minus specific heat at

816
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,640
constant volume
on a molar basis.

817
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,159
And this holds then for

818
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,034
all ideal gases, okay?

819
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:21,230
So RUCp minus CV

820
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,669
there for the monotonic
gases is like that.

821
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:25,589
I don't really, you know,

822
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:26,869
I'm only mentioning
it since you

823
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,229
brought it up and
triggered me with it,

824
00:34:29,229 --> 00:34:30,549
but you can look into it.

825
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:31,549
But yeah, this is then

826
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:34,150
the specific gas constant.

827
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,579
Okay? Other questions?
Yes, please.

828
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:43,449
In the play by play.

829
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,609
So the play by
play here is that

830
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:47,089
what I'm saying
with this first

831
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:48,649
statement is
for a process,

832
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:50,049
the only types of changes

833
00:34:50,049 --> 00:34:51,249
in entropy can be for me

834
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:52,449
transferring heat in or

835
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:55,449
out, internally
reversible there.

836
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,049
You write the first law

837
00:34:57,049 --> 00:34:59,410
with this first law
written in this format,

838
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,249
assuming that I have this

839
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:04,170
compressible system
internally reversible.

840
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,570
I don't have any friction.

841
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,769
The type of work I can do

842
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:08,490
is boundary work, PDV,

843
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,929
and the way that entropy

844
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:11,210
can change there is TDS,

845
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,809
keep being transferred
in and out,

846
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,009
and that's equal to DU.

847
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,369
So first law
written now and

848
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:16,969
a second law of
way, all right?

849
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:19,049
Um, this, I'm just
repeating it.

850
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:20,770
This I'm dividing by mass.

851
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,929
This, I'm telling you

852
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:23,809
a definition of enthalpy.

853
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:26,009
Here I'm doing chain rule.

854
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:27,810
Here I'm substituting

855
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,409
that chain rule
back into this,

856
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:30,850
and I'm just writing

857
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,489
one version of what's

858
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:34,290
called the TDS equation.

859
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,809
Or if you like to
write old guy names,

860
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,250
you can it the
Gibbs equation.

861
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,330
But I like TDS. That's
my old man's initials.

862
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,289
So TDS is there.

863
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:46,089
Um, So you've got that.

864
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:48,570
I rearrange now because
what I'm interested

865
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,809
in is changes just

866
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,369
in the property
of entropy.

867
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:53,729
Here, I want to relate
changes in entropy to

868
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:55,009
changes in
properties I can

869
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:56,569
measure, things
that I care about.

870
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:57,529
So I do that here.

871
00:35:57,529 --> 00:35:59,369
I divide by
temperature, fine.

872
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:00,729
Now I got a bunch of

873
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:02,369
things that I
can't integrate.

874
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,929
I need to substitute in,

875
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,090
for dH CP dT,

876
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,929
because that makes
that integrable.

877
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:12,089
And then with V, I have
an equation of state.

878
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,049
I have the ideal gas
I substitute in.

879
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,209
And ultimately, what
I get is changes in

880
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,660
entropy related to
things I can measure.

881
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,109
And then I say, I
want this to be

882
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:21,669
isotropic because I want

883
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:23,069
to talk about the
maximum possible.

884
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:24,790
And now I can
relate temperature

885
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,259
to pressure with
constants that I know.

886
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:28,969
And that's
convenient. It was

887
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:30,890
especially convenient
when you had tables.

888
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,609
When you had to do
tables and look it up,

889
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,049
this was like,
Whoa. Oh, my God.

890
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:35,289
I only want to
work with air,

891
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:36,689
you know, forget water.

892
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:38,649
All right? So that's
one approach that you

893
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:40,689
can get one formula
from that, right?

894
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:44,529
But we also know
that changes in

895
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:46,209
internal energy can be

896
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:48,930
related to changes in
temperature through CV,

897
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,289
another constant
that we know, okay?

898
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:51,689
And it turns out
that if we can write

899
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:53,329
a second equation
where changes in

900
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:54,929
entropy are
temperatures in

901
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:56,929
specific volumes,
set that to zero.

902
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,449
Now I can relate
temperature to

903
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,489
specific volume for a
reversible process.

904
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:01,529
All I got to know is

905
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:02,569
some constants that I can

906
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:04,840
look up or, uh,
even easier.

907
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,039
And then everything
after that

908
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,679
is me just mathing
it, right?

909
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,440
So everything after
that is some math.

910
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,960
And then saying that, boy,

911
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,920
writing R and CP and CV
is kind of annoying.

912
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,319
Remember before
when we had

913
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,879
that PV polytropic
process to the K,

914
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:20,079
I kind of like K
or Kappa, okay?

915
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,040
That's a choice.

916
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,400
You don't have to
make that choice,

917
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,560
but someone made
that choice.

918
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,299
So we have Kappa
that's there.

919
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:28,319
And essentially,
we recover

920
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:29,840
that adiabatic equation,

921
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,080
PV to the K is equal
to a constant,

922
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,800
and then two
other formulas

923
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,839
or one other formula
that we have and

924
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,599
another one that
emerges because we set

925
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,000
those two original
equations

926
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,799
equal to each other.

927
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,440
But the name of the game
is that I can relate

928
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,279
measurable properties
to each other,

929
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:47,999
assuming that it is

930
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,519
isotropic and
an ideal gas,

931
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,119
which is relevant
for engines.

932
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,839
So any engine
that runs on air,

933
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,759
you know, propulsion,
all of that,

934
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:00,640
these hold for
the ideal cases.

935
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,999
And we can get into, okay,

936
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,680
what if it's
not isentropic?

937
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,919
Yeah, we'll get
to there next,

938
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,119
but this is the
step. Is that clear?

939
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,599
Yes, please. David, right?

940
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,319
David. Yes. Thank you.

941
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:13,000
Are we going to them?

942
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,919
I don't care. Just be
consistent, you know?

943
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,559
If you like it, do it.

944
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,040
But just be consistent.

945
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,955
I can translate.
Other questions?

946
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:24,390
But just know that in
the book, it's Kapp.

947
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,749
In the book, it's KappA.

948
00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:26,989
And when you look
it up in the book,

949
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:28,349
it's also KappA, right?

950
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:30,149
And you won't be able

951
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:31,910
to call that with P Kalre.

952
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,310
What you can call
with Pi Kilo

953
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,790
is you can call CP and CV.

954
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,870
And so then K or
Kappa or Gamma,

955
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,349
in your case would
be defined then as

956
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,789
the ratio of
the two, okay?

957
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,469
Look, you know, if
you want physics,

958
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:45,669
it's a great
place, but you

959
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:47,229
crossed that road, okay?

960
00:38:47,229 --> 00:38:49,829
Fine. And this
building, these people,

961
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,149
I feel maybe are
closer to us as

962
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:55,109
engineers than they
are to the physicists.

963
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:56,270
So this is more of a Kappa

964
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,390
crowd than maybe a Gamma.

965
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,149
Okay. Other
questions? These are

966
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:02,989
nice questions. Okay.

967
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:05,349
And so, you know, what
does this look like?

968
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:06,709
So remember
before we wrote

969
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:12,150
this PV diagram for
the Karno cycle.

970
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,909
So for the ideal gas
Karno cycle there,

971
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:17,229
what I'm plotting now
is that same thing,

972
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,029
and I'm computing
temperature and

973
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:22,550
entropy based on
those relations.

974
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,709
All right. And
so what you'll

975
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:26,909
see in the end is
that this is going to

976
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,869
draw a rectangle because

977
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,549
that's exactly what
Karno is, isn't it?

978
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:33,549
A Karno is a transfer heat

979
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:34,670
in at constant
temperature,

980
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,550
transfer heat out at
constant temperature,

981
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,069
and work transfer
processes

982
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:41,949
are adiabatic and
reversible, okay?

983
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:43,590
So isotropic.

984
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,789
So that's why
those, right?

985
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:46,150
So that would be
your workout,

986
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,629
and that's your
work in, okay?

987
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,519
I'll get played again,

988
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,520
I guess, while I erase.

989
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,359
Cool. Don't answer that,

990
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,040
just sketch.

991
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,110
Cool.

992
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,549
Yeah, and so now I

993
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:46,789
can show you the
application of that.

994
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:47,469
And so with this,

995
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:48,789
I'll show you
two approaches.

996
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:51,669
So I'll analyze one
using Pi Killor, right?

997
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:53,389
So what I showed you
for the turbine,

998
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:54,709
and I'm going to do
another one with

999
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:56,909
the isotropic relations
that we just did,

1000
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:58,269
and then you can
compare the difference

1001
00:40:58,269 --> 00:40:59,629
and the answers
at the end,

1002
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:01,189
and then decide,
you know, do I

1003
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:03,829
feel lucky or not, okay?

1004
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,909
When you decide
to do that.

1005
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:08,149
Okay, so what are we
talking about here?

1006
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,309
So we have a compressor,

1007
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:12,349
and it runs on nitrogen.

1008
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:14,069
So we have a compressor,

1009
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:16,749
compress a compressor.

1010
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:18,269
So what does a
compressor look like?

1011
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:21,349
It takes something from
high specific volume

1012
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,709
and makes it low.

1013
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:23,989
So this would
be, let's say,

1014
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:25,829
like an inlet here.

1015
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:27,389
And then this would
be, let's say,

1016
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:28,869
like an outlet here.

1017
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:31,229
Let's call this
state one in state

1018
00:41:31,229 --> 00:41:34,550
two and give it a
control volume.

1019
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,909
So I'm going control
volume all right here

1020
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:40,669
in green, like that.

1021
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:42,709
So that's my CV.

1022
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:48,429
And the gas here
is nitrogen.

1023
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:51,509
So N two is what
we're compressing.

1024
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,789
What we're told
is that it's

1025
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:53,909
entering at a pressure

1026
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:56,469
of P one is 110 kPa,

1027
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:58,469
so atmospheric
pressure and

1028
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:02,269
a temperature of 30
degrees Celsius,

1029
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,669
so a bit of a warm day.

1030
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:06,109
And then it exits at
a pressure of P two,

1031
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:09,949
which is 682 kPa.

1032
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:11,669
Okay? And you're told that

1033
00:42:11,669 --> 00:42:14,869
this process is
reversible, okay?

1034
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,069
So you're told this is,

1035
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:19,869
uh reversible and that

1036
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,269
this compressor
operates adiabatically.

1037
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:27,629
So this is an adiabatic
adiabatic compressor,

1038
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,509
which basically means
for us that this

1039
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:32,469
is an isotropic, right.

1040
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:35,469
So it means basically
from S one,

1041
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,219
Specific entropy

1042
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:39,459
at state one is
going to be equal to

1043
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:43,579
specific entropy at
state state two, okay?

1044
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:45,899
All right, we're going
to neglect, right?

1045
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:50,419
So we neglect,
changes in E,

1046
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:53,139
neglect changes in
potential energy.

1047
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,659
Reversible adiabatic,

1048
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,019
it's a steady flow device.

1049
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:57,579
So the steady flow
device, right,

1050
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:58,899
the change in the mass of

1051
00:42:58,899 --> 00:43:00,459
the control
volume is zero,

1052
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:02,579
and the change
in the energy of

1053
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,099
our control volume is
also equal to zero.

1054
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:10,989
All right. Um All right,

1055
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,229
so then your DE, right?

1056
00:43:12,229 --> 00:43:15,549
So D MCV dt, right,

1057
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:18,869
m.in minus M dot out,

1058
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:20,949
right? This goes to zero.

1059
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:22,509
So what it
implies is right

1060
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:24,549
M dot is equal to m.in,

1061
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:26,469
is equal to M dot out.

1062
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:28,389
For our energy equation,

1063
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:32,589
DECv dt is e.in

1064
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:35,509
minus E dot out

1065
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:37,429
because it's steady
flow, right?

1066
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:38,589
That goes to zero. So your

1067
00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:43,309
e.in is equal to your
e dot out, right?

1068
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:47,269
Okay, for this
to be, right?

1069
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:48,429
So this is a compressor.

1070
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:49,829
So what it means is
that we're going

1071
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:51,749
to have work, right?

1072
00:43:51,749 --> 00:43:53,429
That's transferred
in, right?

1073
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:57,549
So I'm going to have
some w.in that's there.

1074
00:43:57,549 --> 00:44:00,830
There's my dot
that's entering.

1075
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,429
It's adiabatic.

1076
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:05,389
So it means my
q.in is equal to

1077
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:08,309
my Q dot out is
equal to zero.

1078
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:10,469
Our velocities are

1079
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:13,069
essentially zero
in the sense

1080
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:14,949
that they don't contribute

1081
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:18,189
very much to the rate
of energy in and out.

1082
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,349
And so we don't have
any workout, right?

1083
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:25,110
So we have w.in plus.h1,

1084
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,639
m.h1 is equal to m.h2.

1085
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:31,969
All right, so I

1086
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,329
neglect all the
other stuff, right?

1087
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:34,769
And so then when
I rearrange,

1088
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:36,969
I have w dot N is equal to

1089
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:40,449
M dot times H
two minus H one.

1090
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:42,129
That makes sense
because I'd

1091
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:43,769
expect S two to

1092
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:45,009
be at a higher
temperature, right?

1093
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:46,089
I'm compressing that I'

1094
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:47,089
putting energy
through work,

1095
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:48,249
so I'd expect
that to be at

1096
00:44:48,249 --> 00:44:49,929
a higher enthalpy
than state one.

1097
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:52,209
And that formula H

1098
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:56,289
two minus H one
reflects that there.

1099
00:44:56,289 --> 00:45:01,649
Okay. Mm. So I
can move that.

1100
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:07,309
Blah, blah, blah.

1101
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:08,789
Okay, so for state, so

1102
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,309
let's do P Killor style.

1103
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:13,829
So for state
one, State one,

1104
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:17,509
we know P one,
we know T one.

1105
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:19,029
And so what this
means is that we

1106
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:20,869
know S one and
we know H one.

1107
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:22,029
So I can substitute

1108
00:45:22,029 --> 00:45:23,589
that H one that I
had into there,

1109
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:26,549
and I can use
information about S one.

1110
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:30,189
For state two, all
we know is P two.

1111
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:31,229
And because from

1112
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,950
the assumption
of isentropic,

1113
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,029
S two is equal to S one.

1114
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:40,304
And so from this, we
can get to H two, okay?

1115
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,499
The other thing I'll
note with this,

1116
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:43,379
because we're going to

1117
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:44,499
use it for the ideal gas,

1118
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:45,899
is that with this
information, you

1119
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:47,179
could also get,
like, a CP,

1120
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:50,179
right, a specific heat
at constant pressure.

1121
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:51,659
You could also
get a CV, right,

1122
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:53,219
a specific heat at

1123
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:56,219
constant at constant
volume, right?

1124
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:58,539
And so with this, right,

1125
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:01,739
that's enough
information to, right,

1126
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:05,659
determine the workout
per unit mass.

1127
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:09,179
So if I go with W dot
N divided by M dot,

1128
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:11,739
right, that's H
two minus H one,

1129
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:14,130
which you would
know from Pi color.

1130
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,119
And in this case, what
I'm going to get is

1131
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,199
215 kilojoules
per kilogram

1132
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:22,799
with using Pi kilo

1133
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:25,200
for determining
properties.

1134
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,159
Okay, but I told

1135
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,159
you before we could treat,

1136
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,319
you know, if
we assume now.

1137
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,339
So if we assume
that nitrogen is

1138
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:39,499
an ideal gas and that this

1139
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:43,739
is an isotropic process.

1140
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:47,459
And I can relate
T two is equal

1141
00:46:47,459 --> 00:46:51,939
to T one for an isotropic
process times P

1142
00:46:51,939 --> 00:46:56,019
two divided by
P one to the K

1143
00:46:56,019 --> 00:47:01,379
minus one divided
by K there.

1144
00:47:01,379 --> 00:47:03,619
And again, just
recall that this is

1145
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:06,539
equal to cp divided by CB.

1146
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:08,179
You need to get
this from PCLor.

1147
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:09,819
This is also like at
the very start of

1148
00:47:09,819 --> 00:47:13,074
the tables in
the textbook.

1149
00:47:13,074 --> 00:47:14,369
All right.

1150
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:16,089
Also, for an ideal gas,

1151
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:17,489
you can remember
that changes in

1152
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:19,369
enthalp for an ideal gas

1153
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,810
are equal to Cp times

1154
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,249
changes in
temperature, right?

1155
00:47:23,249 --> 00:47:25,609
So for us, H two
minus H one is Cp

1156
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,209
two minus T one
there, okay?

1157
00:47:29,209 --> 00:47:31,209
And if you
substitute numbers

1158
00:47:31,209 --> 00:47:33,369
in for that, right?

1159
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:36,009
So then this H two

1160
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:39,889
minus the H one
for the ideal gas,

1161
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:41,489
what I find is

1162
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:49,409
216.7 kilojoules
per kilogram, okay?

1163
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,609
So what are we talking?
Half a percent.

1164
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:54,249
So you have half a
percent difference in

1165
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:55,369
the work per unit

1166
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:56,929
mass output of
the compressor

1167
00:47:56,929 --> 00:47:58,449
when you assume ideal gas

1168
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,329
with specific heats at

1169
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,449
the inlet
temperature versus

1170
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:03,009
the case when you

1171
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:04,249
go in and you compute very

1172
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,534
accurately the
process, okay?

1173
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:08,659
So the take home message

1174
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:09,739
out of that is that it's

1175
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:11,940
a pretty good
approximation

1176
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,539
to do, right,
these approaches.

1177
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:15,619
You know, if you do have

1178
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:17,539
the isentropic
process using this,

1179
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:19,459
relating differences
in enthalpy

1180
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:20,419
to a specific heat

1181
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:21,499
that you select,
let's say,

1182
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,379
a T one, the inlet
temperature times that

1183
00:48:23,379 --> 00:48:26,259
Delta T gets you a
pretty darn close value,

1184
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:28,459
okay. Better than 2%.

1185
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:30,859
All right? I'll
move this over.

1186
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:46,859
Questions about that?
Yes, please. 216.7.

1187
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,379
Yes, please.

1188
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:53,540
Equation for the turbine,

1189
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,459
it's on the
equation sheet.

1190
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:57,139
So would you have
to show the process

1191
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,699
of getting up to
there on the exam?

1192
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,259
You just have to
state assumptions.

1193
00:49:00,259 --> 00:49:02,459
I write things in
great detail so

1194
00:49:02,459 --> 00:49:03,659
that you can get into the

1195
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:05,219
mental habit of
going through.

1196
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:07,019
But as long as you
say, like, hey,

1197
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:09,299
steady flow, e,
dot, e, dot dot,

1198
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:11,820
neglect heat, right,
neglect workout,

1199
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,139
and I come up
with this, that's

1200
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:14,459
perfectly
acceptable to me.

1201
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:15,379
The main thing is that if

1202
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:16,539
I have to partially
grade you

1203
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:17,339
and you don't show me

1204
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:18,699
logic and work,
it's so hard.

1205
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:20,179
And then I get in a
bad mood and I get

1206
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:21,859
grumpy and my
wife's mad at me.

1207
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:24,339
So just show some work.

1208
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:28,939
Other questions?
Okay. So we

1209
00:49:28,939 --> 00:49:30,099
are 30 seconds early.

1210
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:31,379
With that, I'm
going to close it.

1211
00:49:31,379 --> 00:49:33,779
If you have questions,
I'm up here.
