1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
With gas power cycles.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,520
The the final unit
of this today.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,760
After today,

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,960
you're going to be
able to analyze

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,320
propulsion power
and efficiency

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,960
of a jet propulsion cycle.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,360
So a jet engine.

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,520
We're going to
talk about this,

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,040
and then we'll analyze

10
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,839
the efficiency of
the most efficient

11
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,719
engine that can be done.

12
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,439
And then with this,
we close, and we

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,919
move into vapor power.

14
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,479
Okay? All right.

15
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:28,039
So what is jet propulsion?

16
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,839
So again, On the left

17
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,239
here was kind of our
pinwheel example, right?

18
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,840
We blow air on
a propeller.

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,119
We get it to move, we get

20
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,919
shaft work, vice
versa, right?

21
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,279
I can put in shaft work,

22
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:41,839
rotate this thing
and move air and go.

23
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:43,839
And essentially, if
you're going to say

24
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:45,719
this simply with
the propeller,

25
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,439
you want to
accelerate slightly

26
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,439
accelerate a very large
mass of fluid, right?

27
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,484
That's essentially what
a propeller is doing.

28
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,849
Um, if you want to
go much faster,

29
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:54,689
so if you want to go

30
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,010
faster than the
speed of sound,

31
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,410
okay, this has limits.

32
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,049
Once you get to the
speed of sound,

33
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:00,930
it doesn't
accelerate anymore.

34
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,369
You need new
mechanisms, okay?

35
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:03,609
And the strategy here is

36
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:04,729
essentially you greatly

37
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,249
accelerate a very
small packet of fuel,

38
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:09,009
right or air, a
very small amount

39
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,549
of air, um, okay?

40
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,349
So what is

41
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,949
the ideal jet propulsion
cycle look like?

42
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:18,949
So air enters in

43
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:21,389
here at atmospheric
pressure,

44
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:23,909
at atmospheric
temperature, right?

45
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,030
And it's moving
with some velocity.

46
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,550
And the way that we're
going to analyze

47
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,949
this is that
we're going to

48
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:30,789
say that in this
reference frame

49
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,069
it is not moving, okay?

50
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,749
So obviously,
you are moving,

51
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:36,390
but for the purposes
of this analysis,

52
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,225
we treat the
engine as static,

53
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,259
And the speed that
the jet moves with.

54
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,979
So essentially
the speed of

55
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,819
the aircraft is then

56
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,859
equal to the velocity
of the inlet, okay?

57
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,779
So we have, you know,
velocity coming in at

58
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:53,580
some relatively fast speed

59
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,379
at T one and T one,

60
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,979
which is atmospheric
pressure

61
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,340
and atmospheric
temperature.

62
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,979
So that goes into
a diffuser, right?

63
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,179
A diffuser slows
this down. Go ahead.

64
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,939
How does it work?

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,159
I mean, how does it

66
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,639
work when it's
standing still?

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,760
You're not doing
your job then, okay?

68
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,240
So I guess what

69
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,319
you're alluding to is
the startup phase,

70
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,480
basically, the
transients there.

71
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,240
That's not what I'm
doing. Okay? So this

72
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,479
is steady
process, alright?

73
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,759
Do you want to
get unsteady?

74
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,600
It's another class, okay?

75
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,019
Um So essentially,

76
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,020
you have that coming
into a diffuser,

77
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,099
and a diffuser is then

78
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,180
going to decelerate, okay?

79
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,139
So essentially, we're
going to take a lot

80
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,419
of kinetic energy here
and some enthalpy,

81
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,819
and we're going
to slow it down,

82
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,180
which essentially
means you're

83
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,500
going to gain enthalpy
at state two.

84
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,220
Things are going to
heat up a bit, okay?

85
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,500
And we're going
to treat this as

86
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,699
an isentropic process.

87
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,140
State one to two,
we're going to call

88
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,580
this diffuser as an
isentropic nozzle.

89
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,500
What type of flow
was isentropic flow?

90
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,379
So, so the B
ends in noulli.

91
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,539
Okay, so, right,

92
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:58,299
so basically have

93
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,859
an isotropic
flow from here.

94
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,140
So we have this, you know,

95
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,140
enthalpy and
kinetic energy,

96
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,980
which basically becomes

97
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,180
all enthalpy here, okay?

98
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,060
Then you have
a compressor.

99
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,660
This is going to

100
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,259
operate adiabatically
and reversibly,

101
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,060
which means
isotropically, okay?

102
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,299
So you have an
isotropic compression.

103
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:18,900
It's going to get even
warmer through this.

104
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,559
So now you're at
a high pressure.

105
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,099
And a moderate
temperature.

106
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,860
Then you have a
combustion chamber, okay?

107
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,779
Then the combustion
chamber.

108
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:27,460
All right, we're
going to have

109
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,300
at a constant pressure

110
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,139
process of the
heat addition.

111
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,100
So here you're going to

112
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,619
get to a higher
temperature.

113
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:36,620
Then you're going to run

114
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,260
a turbine, all right?

115
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,620
4-5, that's going to
operate isentropically.

116
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,420
And what's interesting
about this and

117
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,459
what sets this apart from

118
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,660
what we did in Brayton
is that all of

119
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,219
the work that you have
out of the turbine,

120
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:51,979
you put back into
the compressor.

121
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,419
It's like you have stocks

122
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,659
and you make
money on that,

123
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,140
and you just put all
the money back into

124
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,739
the stocks and
you reinvest.

125
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:58,500
It's the same thing.

126
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,009
You don't have any,
You don't have

127
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,250
any net shaft work
leaving this device.

128
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,490
You got cue in, okay?

129
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,569
You got cue in, and
you're going to have some

130
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,170
what we're going to

131
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,850
call propulsion power out.

132
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,129
But basically, all the

133
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,449
work out of the turbine

134
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,089
is going to go back
into the compressor

135
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,449
and compress the
fluid, okay?

136
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:19,689
Good. Five to six then,

137
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:20,849
this is a nozzle, right?

138
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,209
So entering the
nozzle, right,

139
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:23,810
you're going to have
a lot of enthalpy

140
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,010
and not very much
kinetic energy.

141
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,729
And what you're going
to then do there

142
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,570
is to have an
isotropic flow,

143
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,529
where then you have
some enthalpy and

144
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:33,849
a lot of kinetic energy,
okay, at the exit.

145
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,329
And that's the whole
point because at

146
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:36,850
the end of this, right,

147
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,169
you're going to
want a um a force

148
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,609
or a propulsive power
to drive this, okay?

149
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:43,450
So you really want to,

150
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,809
you know, up speed
things up here.

151
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:48,089
Okay? Cool. So let's go

152
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,689
through now that I've
set you up on that,

153
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,650
let's go through
the analysis here.

154
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,730
I'll give you
some numbers.

155
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,729
So again, similarly,

156
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,050
I'll give you some
numbers and also

157
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,809
derive into the
analysis of how

158
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:02,250
we arrive at efficiency.

159
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,210
So, you say you
have a turbojet,

160
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,410
a turbo jet aircraft
flying with a velocity

161
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:19,240
the aircraft equal to
260 meters/second.

162
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,759
Let me just check my
writing. It looks good.

163
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,599
At an altitude where

164
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,919
the pressure so we'll
call it P zero for now,

165
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,119
but then we'll
set it to P one.

166
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:35,119
We have 34.5 PA.

167
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,119
All right. And that
makes sense, right?

168
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,920
So why do you fly
high? You fly

169
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,999
high because you have less

170
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,119
drag up there, right?

171
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,719
If a commercial
and you go far,

172
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,919
so and so the pressure is

173
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,199
obviously going to
be lower there,

174
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,359
and it's cold, right?

175
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:51,399
-40 degrees
Celsius, all right?

176
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,799
We're told that we have
a compression ratio.

177
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:56,834
So, um,

178
00:05:56,834 --> 00:06:02,230
sure RP for our compressor
is equal to ten.

179
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,309
So essentially, the
pressure at state

180
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:06,989
three is equal
to ten times

181
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:09,469
that of state two.

182
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:14,569
So P three is equal
to ten times P two.

183
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:17,309
And the temperature of

184
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:18,549
the gases at the turbine

185
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,789
inlet is a big number.

186
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:23,750
So we're then told
that T at T four.

187
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,229
So basically T four,

188
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,549
we're told is equal to

189
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:32,789
1039 degrees
Celsius, right?

190
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:34,149
And the final bit
of information

191
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:35,510
we're given is an MDOT.

192
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,110
We're told that
the mass flow rate

193
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,069
of air entering
the compressor

194
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:44,949
is 45 kilograms/second,
right?

195
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,789
What are we
told to assume?

196
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,109
So we're told to assume

197
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:59,879
The cold air
standard assumption.

198
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,939
Right?

199
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,380
Which to remind you,

200
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,700
is that if we
just talk about

201
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,940
the air standard
assumption,

202
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,099
the air standard
assumption says first that

203
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,380
we treat all combustion

204
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,699
processes as
heat addition.

205
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,659
So three to four is going

206
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,819
to be a heat
addition process.

207
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,060
There is no introduction

208
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,419
of mass from the
fuel into that.

209
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,219
We have an m.in
and an M dot out,

210
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:21,500
which is steady
and only air.

211
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,299
It's justified
because most of

212
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,499
air is not reactive.
It's nitrogen, right?

213
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:26,699
So most of what
goes in and

214
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,660
most comes out
as nitrogen,

215
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,449
which doesn't react or
mostly doesn't react.

216
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,280
And because of that,

217
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,519
the fluid's going to
behave like air, right?

218
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,879
So we're going to
basically treat

219
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,999
the thermodynamic
properties of

220
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,480
the fluid throughout
this whole process

221
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,880
as an ideal gas,

222
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,399
including into the
combustion chamber.

223
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,279
For the cold part of it,

224
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,564
the cold just means
that we're lazy.

225
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:53,649
It means that we just
take the specific heats

226
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,530
at that we keep

227
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,290
these specific
heats constant,

228
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,089
and we set their
values to be

229
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:02,250
that at room temperature
and pressure.

230
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,369
Or in this case, I'm going

231
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,689
to set it at
the state one,

232
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,089
essentially at state one

233
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,449
when it enters there.

234
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,289
So that's the meaning
of cold, alright?

235
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,010
And we do this
it's convenient,

236
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,729
and I'll show you that

237
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,290
the error at the
end of this,

238
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,889
the efficiency
the error in

239
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,689
the final efficiency
is less than 10%.

240
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,090
So it's not

241
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,409
a bad assumption to
get started with.

242
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,359
Okay, um Yes.

243
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,599
Again, we're going to

244
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,000
treat this as stationary.

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,519
Like I said before,
stationary,

246
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,439
meaning that the
jet, you know,

247
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,479
it's like I could
either be flying

248
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,880
and I could
have, you know,

249
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,720
air entering, you
know, relatively,

250
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,959
or I could just
be stationary

251
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,159
and have all that velocity

252
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,280
entering in that way.

253
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,069
Um, For the diffuser,

254
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:47,469
I'll get to these
assumptions,

255
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:48,070
but we're going to

256
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,470
make some
assumptions about

257
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,149
the diffuser
and the nozzle.

258
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,549
In the case of
the diffuser,

259
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:55,430
we're going to have a lot

260
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,189
of kinetic
energy entering,

261
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:58,750
and we're going to neglect

262
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,150
kinetic energy
at the exit.

263
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,430
For the nozzle, it's
vice versa, right?

264
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,669
So the whole
point is that you

265
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,870
want to accelerate
the fluid,

266
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,270
so the velocity coming in

267
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,950
doesn't have a lot
of kinetic energy,

268
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,590
but when it
exits, it does.

269
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,590
We can treat this
as an ideal gas,

270
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,590
or we can use Piclor to
determine properties.

271
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,750
Again, in my notebook,

272
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,975
you can go through
and see that.

273
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:27,440
So yeah,

274
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,359
the compressors and
turbines are reversible.

275
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,519
They're diabatic.
That means

276
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,599
that they're isentropic.

277
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,760
This is a steady
flow process.

278
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
And the heat exchange

279
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,519
here, the heat exchanger,

280
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,279
we're going to treat
is isobaric like we

281
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,240
do for the other
ones, right?

282
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
Okay, so this helps
us to get started.

283
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,715
So process one
to two, one.

284
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:56,549
To do. So if I look
at my diffuser here,

285
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:57,830
which is kind of like it's

286
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,189
a little bit different.

287
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:02,269
I'll draw it like

288
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,710
this to give kind
of the meeting.

289
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,990
So we have you're
entering at

290
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,830
state one at state two.

291
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,229
Here's your
control volume.

292
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:12,390
We have an m.in and
then M dot out,

293
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,150
which means we have
an M dot, right?

294
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,030
Steady flow, m.in
is M dot out.

295
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,269
And we don't have

296
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:23,230
any change in energy in

297
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,350
the control volume, right?

298
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,490
Oe.in is equal to R dot,

299
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,530
R dot out here, right?

300
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:41,220
Steady flow. So, um, two.

301
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,659
Exactly. So the ways

302
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:44,899
that we don't have
work transfer,

303
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,180
we don't have heat
transfer here.

304
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,740
So what we can have
is we can have

305
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,220
an M dot times H one,

306
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,420
which is entering plus

307
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,340
a velocity one
squared divided by

308
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,900
two is then equal to

309
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,820
an M dot times
times H two, right?

310
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,500
So really from this,

311
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,940
what you have is
that H two, right,

312
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,100
is equal to H one

313
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,380
plus velocity one
squared divided by two.

314
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,780
And why don't I have?

315
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,540
I mean, of course,

316
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,820
I could write I could
write here that

317
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I have W two squared

318
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,380
divided by two like that.

319
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,260
But the reason why I don't

320
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,700
is because I'm decelerating
the fluid, right?

321
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,179
The whole point of
the diffuser is

322
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,939
that you're
decelerating the fluid,

323
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:33,660
and so W one is much,

324
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,540
much greater than
right than W two.

325
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,660
And so what it means is

326
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,230
that this goes
away, a right?

327
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,960
I would say it's
intuitive, but, yeah,

328
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,280
that's what you
when you do

329
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,800
this analysis, that's
what you would do.

330
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,280
There may be
some cases where

331
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,720
I might give you
a diffuser and

332
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,120
I give you an
inlet and I give

333
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
you an outlet velocity.

334
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,599
That's fine. If you
make this assumption,

335
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,959
I probably could
accept it.

336
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,360
But you could also
just, you know,

337
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,120
compare them. You can
calculate the value.

338
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,759
You could say that
you neglected,

339
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,120
or probably what's easiest

340
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,639
is that you just do
the substitution

341
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,479
and you determine
the enthalpy

342
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,520
at state two, right?

343
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,950
Okay, um, Good. I
also said, right?

344
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,110
I said that this was
an isentropic process.

345
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,950
So, of course, we could do

346
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,110
an entropy analysis also

347
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,389
on this control volume.

348
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:23,310
And what you would

349
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,150
see from that
is that right,

350
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,750
there's no change
in the steady flow.

351
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,070
There's no change
in the entropy

352
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,909
in this control volume.

353
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:33,829
It's isentropic.

354
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:35,669
It means that there's
no entropy generated.

355
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,830
And so what that
means is that S two

356
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,390
is little S two is

357
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,255
equal to little
S one, okay?

358
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,240
And that can be useful.

359
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,080
Well, that would be
useful if you use

360
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,600
Pi color because now
you would know H two,

361
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
and you know an S
two, you'd have that.

362
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,080
You could also use
TDS relations, right?

363
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,240
I could use TDS
relations and also then

364
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,880
work out other properties

365
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,960
like temperature
and pressure.

366
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,600
Okay?

367
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,640
Good. Any questions
till now?

368
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,800
Yes, please, Presley.

369
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:17,359
Say it one more time
Comity Comssibility.

370
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,600
So you are by

371
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,240
definition compressing
this fluid.

372
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,400
Why? Well, I mean,

373
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,280
what do you see
about State

374
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,600
three relative
to State two?

375
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,160
You're compressing. If I

376
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,480
take a fluid
and I compress,

377
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,800
you are
compressible. Okay.

378
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,465
Other questions?

379
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:40,250
All right. Great.
So now we've done

380
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,450
our entropy and our
energy analysis

381
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,410
of one to two, so
we can move on.

382
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,930
All right, two to three.

383
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,450
So two to three. So from
states two to three,

384
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,850
here I have a
compressor, right?

385
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,569
So this is what

386
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,889
my compressor
would look like.

387
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,569
I have here my shaft,

388
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,489
okay, that I'm rotating.

389
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:03,849
I have some w.in that

390
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:06,830
I'm transferring
there. All right.

391
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,590
This is State two
here. All right.

392
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,829
And this is, um,

393
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:15,829
State three,
which is exiting.

394
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:19,590
Here's my control
volume, looks like that.

395
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,669
Again, steady flow device,

396
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,349
so there's no
change in energy

397
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:24,469
in the control volume,

398
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:27,069
no change in mass, no
change in entropy.

399
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:31,950
All right. Um. And some

400
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,270
piece of information
that we know,

401
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,630
we know that P
three is equal to

402
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,510
ten times P two
because we're told.

403
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,700
Right? Um Good.

404
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,340
So that's one part of it.

405
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,540
If we do, again, our e.in,

406
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,899
it's steady flow
is equal to

407
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,380
our E dot out, right?

408
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,859
There is it's
adiabatic here,

409
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:00,820
so there's no
heat in or out.

410
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,340
There is work that's in,

411
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,900
and there's mass
that enters

412
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,580
with an enthal
P at state two.

413
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,820
We neglect changes in

414
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,340
kinetic and
potential energy.

415
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,500
So then what this is equal

416
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,660
to is then an MDOT,

417
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,500
and there's no workout,
there's no heat out.

418
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,659
And so this is then
going to be like this.

419
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,060
And so then your w.in

420
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,659
here is going to be
M dot times H three,

421
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,580
minus minus H two.

422
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,700
We do our entropy
analysis, right?

423
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,940
There's no change
in entropy in here.

424
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,740
There is no entropy
generation.

425
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,620
And so what you'll
have then here is that

426
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,740
S three is equal to S two.

427
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,780
All right. Good. So
that takes care of us

428
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,260
then for two to three.

429
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,990
Okay. All right,
three to four

430
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,549
is a combustion chamber.

431
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,430
Three to four is

432
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,670
a combustion
chamber. All right.

433
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,590
Mm mm. All right.

434
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,990
And if we draw this, so

435
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,430
the way that this
would look like

436
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,030
idealized is that we

437
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,230
have some fluid entering
in at state three,

438
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,429
exiting at state four,
draw control volume.

439
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,230
We assume the standard
error assumption,

440
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,269
which means we replace
combustion processes

441
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:18,590
here by heat addition.

442
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,910
So we have some
do some q.in.

443
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,190
Again, no change, m.in
is dot out is dot,

444
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:31,270
e.in is equal to
our E dot out.

445
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,550
We have aq.in.
We don't have

446
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,470
work in. We have an M dot.

447
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,389
We have a fluid
with an enthalpy,

448
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,669
specific enthalpy,

449
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:41,309
H three is equal
to no workout,

450
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:44,590
no heat out, m.h4.

451
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,310
And again, for the
heat exchanger,

452
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,510
we're going to
neglect changes in

453
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,790
kinetic and
potential energy.

454
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,430
So your q.in an

455
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,670
m.h4 minus H
three. All right.

456
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:03,790
Okay. All right,
four to five,

457
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,750
four to five is
our turbine.

458
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,670
So you've seen lots
of examples of

459
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:18,469
this here, W dot out.

460
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,830
Here's our control volume.

461
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,790
I've got some fluid
entering here.

462
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,749
I've got some fluid
leaving here.

463
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,629
This is entering
at state four.

464
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,229
It's exiting
at state five.

465
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:31,750
M.in is M dot
out of M dot.

466
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:39,469
E.in is equal to E is
equal to E dot out.

467
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,789
It's adiabatic.

468
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,190
So the only way energy

469
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,549
is entering is
through the fluid.

470
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:46,549
So.h4 neglect

471
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:48,430
changes the kinetic
and potential energy.

472
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,429
This is then equal
to W dot out.

473
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:54,669
We don't have any Q out.

474
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,270
We also have a
fluid leaving.

475
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,349
So we have an M dot
then times H five.

476
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:03,990
And so our W dot
out here is equal

477
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,549
to M dot times H
four minus H five.

478
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:17,709
All right. Questions?
All clear. Yes, please.

479
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,579
We are looking for
here, let me zoom out.

480
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,939
I said at the
beginning, but okay.

481
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:31,219
So I should write it.

482
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:34,019
So we're looking for A.

483
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,779
You're looking for the
temperature T five,

484
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,499
so the temperature
at the exit of

485
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:44,579
the turbine and P five.

486
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,769
B, what we're
looking for is

487
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:55,449
the velocity of the gases
at the nozzle exit.

488
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,609
So that's the velocity
at state six.

489
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:00,409
And then C, we
want to know what

490
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:03,090
is the propulsion
efficiency.

491
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,170
Okay? Now, through
these different steps,

492
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,130
this is straightforward.

493
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,250
This is analysis
that you've seen.

494
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,369
Part B is also
straightforward.

495
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:13,930
This is going to be

496
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,010
analysis that you've seen.

497
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,289
We're just stringing
it all together.

498
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,609
Part C is then new.

499
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,850
So defining then the
propulsion efficiency.

500
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,699
Other questions?
Yes, please.

501
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:29,029
One employees for my

502
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,059
So we're driving a
turbine here, right?

503
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,780
So the thing is, what
do you want to have

504
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,819
the higher enthalpy at

505
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:37,899
the entrance or the exit?

506
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,099
If I'm taking work out of

507
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:40,539
a control volume there,

508
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,020
which enthropy
should be higher?

509
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,539
The inlet or the outlet?
The inlet, right?

510
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:46,299
So this has to be

511
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,619
greater because that's
what drives it.

512
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,620
The difference
in the enthalpy

513
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
is what's going to
give you the work.

514
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,260
So a four minus
a five times DOT

515
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,939
is the work
transferred out.

516
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:56,340
Yes, please. Are?

517
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,420
One more time?

518
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,859
For every single one.

519
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:08,349
So give me an example
of another one.

520
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:09,519
Okay.

521
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,079
So you could think about

522
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,079
instead of doing
steady combustion,

523
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,879
you could do
detonation, right?

524
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,639
So detonation then is

525
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,839
that what assumption would

526
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,799
you have in detonation?

527
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,240
What cycle did we

528
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,039
analyze before that
operated with detonation?

529
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,919
No, I want a name,
a German name.

530
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,439
So what were
the cycles that

531
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,919
we analyzed in
combustion so

532
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,040
far for gas power cycles?

533
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,000
Carne is a
generalized one,

534
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,600
but I'll give you
a point. Next.

535
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,770
Others. Yes, please, Cody.

536
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,370
Auto, right? Auto
is essentially

537
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,529
the combustion process is

538
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:55,729
so rapid, we
treat it as what?

539
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:56,850
Volume.

540
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,850
Constant volume,
isochoric.

541
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,689
Diesel slower, right?

542
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:01,810
Isobaric.

543
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,849
Here, this heat addition
process is what?

544
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:04,569
F three to four.

545
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:08,969
What did we
assume 3-4 here?

546
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,790
It's a heat exchange,

547
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,070
a steady flow
heat exchanger.

548
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,670
What do we assume
for he exchangers?

549
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,550
Isobaric. Thank you, Maya.

550
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,189
Okay? So if you wanted
to go in and do

551
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,149
an interesting one, you
could do detonation,

552
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:22,910
treat it not as
isobaric as isochoric,

553
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,909
and then you could

554
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:25,829
piece that into this

555
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:27,470
and then you
could solve that.

556
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,509
Sounds like a great
quiz problem.

557
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,509
Okay, you inspired
me. Other questions?

558
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:38,419
Yes, please. So
why don't we?

559
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,859
Why don't you
have one nozzle?

560
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,699
You could do this, okay?

561
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:50,619
That's as simple as
you can get it, okay?

562
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:53,659
If you want the
postmodernist interpretation

563
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,380
of a jet power cycle,

564
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,139
you make a ramjet,
which is it.

565
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:58,380
There's an inlet, there's

566
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,899
an outlet, and that's it.

567
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,179
The trouble is that

568
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:03,139
this is very
difficult to start.

569
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:04,739
This is not like I

570
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,699
turn the key and
I go, all right?

571
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:08,739
There's a lot. You've
already got to be

572
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:10,099
flying very quickly before

573
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,179
you can do something
like that.

574
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,159
It is a great question.
Go to SpaceX.

575
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,119
Other questions?

576
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,639
You can see it later,
right? I'll move it.

577
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,919
I'll move it. Sit closer,
sit on that side.

578
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,319
All right. So that
was four to five.

579
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,599
Does that help, Alex?

580
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:44,649
Yes. Okay. Okay.
Um, where was I?

581
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:48,049
D to do. Okay,
so we did yeah,

582
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:50,490
so the point is that 4-5,

583
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,049
we can also do an entropy
analysis of this.

584
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:54,369
It's adiabatic.

585
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:57,209
So there.

586
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,249
And it's a steady
flow device,

587
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,969
so we don't have any
change in entropy

588
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,130
in the control volume.

589
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,529
It's isentropic, so I

590
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:06,130
don't have any
entropy generated,

591
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,969
and it means that
my specific entropy

592
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,129
at state five is

593
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:10,850
equal to my
specific entropy

594
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,729
at state four, okay?

595
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:16,529
So S is four.

596
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:23,289
Okay. Um All right.

597
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,889
Before I get into

598
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:28,889
the step and the analysis
with the nozzle,

599
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:30,370
I would like to
draw I'd like

600
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,570
to combine the compressor.

601
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,169
So here is my
compressor here

602
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,610
connected to my turbine.

603
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,650
All right? I
have an inlet.

604
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,730
I have an outlet, an inlet

605
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,249
and an outlet like this.

606
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:48,769
So the entrance to

607
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,244
the compressor
is state two.

608
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:53,439
Three. And then for

609
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:55,560
skipping, we don't
have to skip.

610
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,160
We can basically draw,
right? We can draw

611
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,120
our combustion
chamber like that.

612
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,160
Q in q.in.

613
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,359
That's at state three
to four, right?

614
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,839
It's like that. And then

615
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,279
the exit then is basically
state five, right?

616
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,519
And if I draw, if

617
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,279
you were to
essentially look at,

618
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,680
I don't know, control
volume that looks

619
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,589
like This, let's
say, right?

620
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,070
So in my energy analysis,

621
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,829
what I would have for

622
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,549
this control volume is

623
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:31,629
I have no so what goes in,

624
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:34,829
I have aq.in. I
have no work in.

625
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:36,709
I have an M dot,

626
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,029
and I have an H two,

627
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,470
right, which is entering.

628
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,429
And then what's
exiting here.

629
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:45,749
So I have no work
that's out, right?

630
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:47,750
I have basically an m.h5,

631
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,429
which is right, which
is out there, right?

632
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:59,050
And so, why is
that, Interesting.

633
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,649
Just give me a
second. All right?

634
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:03,970
That's interesting
because then essentially,

635
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,729
I can write H five is

636
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:10,329
equal to Q dot N divided

637
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:17,369
by m dot plus H two, okay?

638
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:18,649
So basically,
I'll determine

639
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,569
the enthalpy in
that way, okay?

640
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,169
What am I saying
with that?

641
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:24,329
What I'm basically saying

642
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,489
is that the work out of

643
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,250
the turbine is equal

644
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,249
to the work into
the compressor.

645
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:31,984
All right? Is that clear?

646
00:25:31,984 --> 00:25:34,759
All right. And
then obviously the

647
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,279
q.in is then just

648
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,559
going to be an
M dot, right?

649
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,240
So I can write
this as an M dot.

650
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,199
Here, I'll write
it out explicitly.

651
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:45,239
So an M dot, the Q in.

652
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:47,479
Did I write it
over there? I did.

653
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,319
H four minus H three,

654
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,199
H four minus H three

655
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:55,839
divided by M dot
and plus H two,

656
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,999
and that's your H five.

657
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,519
And since this is an M dot

658
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,080
here, this is gone,

659
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:10,849
and that's gone.
Cool. Good.

660
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,289
All right,
bringing it home.

661
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,369
So five to six. So
process then five to six.

662
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:19,409
I think I've killed
this marker.

663
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:29,279
That's better.
Okay. All right,

664
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,359
so process then
five to six.

665
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,719
Again, it's a
steady flow device.

666
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,720
We have no work
in or workout.

667
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,599
It's adiabatic, no
heat in or heat out.

668
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,959
And we're going to neglect

669
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:46,840
the kinetic energy
at the inlet.

670
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,679
So then what it
means is I have

671
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,239
an M dot times H five,

672
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,759
which is equal to

673
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:58,320
an M dot times

674
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,279
H six plus velocity

675
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,399
six squared
divided by two.

676
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,279
All right. And so if
I rearrange this,

677
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,279
and I'm going to have is

678
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,999
a velocity six at the
exit of the nozzle,

679
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,679
which is equal to
the square root of

680
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,199
two times H
five minus six.

681
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,549
All right, um The

682
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:26,469
other thing that we know

683
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:27,589
about this, so again,

684
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:30,190
if I drew my if I
did this properly,

685
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,189
and I drew my
nozzle, okay?

686
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:36,229
So here's my control
volume on my nozzle.

687
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:38,350
This is my inlet,
that's my outlet,

688
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,949
state five, state six.

689
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:42,790
There's no change
in mass in here.

690
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,030
M.in is M dot
out is M dot.

691
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,429
There's no change
in energy in here,

692
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,109
ED in is e dot out.

693
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:49,989
This is a
consequence of that.

694
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,030
And then when it
comes to entropy,

695
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,469
there's no change in

696
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:55,270
entropy in the
control volume.

697
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,270
It's adiabatic,
it's reversible.

698
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,309
And so what that means
is that little S

699
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:04,789
five is equal to
little S six, right?

700
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,319
All right. The
final step here.

701
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,199
Well, there's two things
that we need to do.

702
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,599
The first is we need to

703
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,559
define propulsion
force and power,

704
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,319
and then we need to define

705
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,559
or we've already
defined the q.in.

706
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,320
So in order to define
the efficiency,

707
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,639
we need to know the
propulsion power.

708
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,760
And before we
get to power,

709
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,759
we need to know force.

710
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,640
So think back
to high school.

711
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,159
Transform yourselves.

712
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,859
F, Newton's second
law, right?

713
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:38,339
So we have a force,

714
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:41,020
and this is equal to
the mass flow rate

715
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,180
times the velocity
at the exit

716
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:51,740
minus N dot times the
velocity at the inlet.

717
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,574
Where does this come from?

718
00:28:53,574 --> 00:28:57,810
Um, momentum is equal to

719
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,330
mass times, um
times velocity.

720
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,449
If I take, um the
derivative of this, right?

721
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:09,130
So what dp dt.

722
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,209
This is dm dt times V

723
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:21,900
plus dv dt, okay?
That's force.

724
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,780
F equals MA is

725
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,900
usually how Newton's
second law is presented,

726
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,419
but it's not
totally correct.

727
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,420
F is equal to m dot times

728
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,939
your velocity
plus A, okay?

729
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,299
Yeah. All right.

730
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:41,299
Let's move this
to the center.

731
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,599
All right. Right? And so

732
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,479
this is what we're talking
about here, right?

733
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,760
So this M dot times

734
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,959
the velocity is what we're

735
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,159
talking about
in this case.

736
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,119
All right. Mmm. All right.

737
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,439
Good. So what is
propulsion power

738
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,759
then? So propulsion power.

739
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:09,600
So our W dot P
is equal to.

740
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,719
So to get this into power,

741
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,839
I need to have
a force acting

742
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,279
on a distance
per unit time.

743
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:19,534
Force on a distance
per unit time.

744
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:23,309
Force times velocity
is that, okay?

745
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:25,709
So if I take this force,

746
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,549
which I've
defined here, F,

747
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,509
and I times it by

748
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:34,390
the velocity of
the aircraft,

749
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,149
I'm going to get
propulsion power.

750
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:38,150
And the efficiency,

751
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,909
the efficiency of
this EAP is nothing

752
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:44,429
but this w dot P

753
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:48,909
divided by Q dot
N. All right?

754
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,749
All right. Where
am I at on this?

755
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:56,669
All right, I can
probably erase this.

756
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,369
Uh huh. All right.

757
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:14,610
So our w dot P
here is equal to

758
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,449
m dot times the velocity

759
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:21,809
at the exit,
which is what?

760
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,369
What's the velocity
of the exit?

761
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:32,370
Minus the velocity
at the inlet.

762
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,529
Okay? And then
this is times

763
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:40,610
the velocity of
the aircraft.

764
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:48,649
Huh. Yes. So this

765
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:54,609
is nothing but
velocity one.

766
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,250
And what we'll assume

767
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,890
for the purposes
of this analysis,

768
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,249
not for the takeoff part,

769
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:03,849
which is relevant, is

770
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:05,729
we're going to assume
that this is equal

771
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:07,689
to the velocity of

772
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:10,409
the aircraft,
which makes sense.

773
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:12,209
I have a stationary
device, okay?

774
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:14,570
I have air coming in
at some velocity.

775
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,930
And I was saying
that that's

776
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,109
the velocity that I'm
moving with, okay?

777
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:23,769
Good. So this is your
formula for that.

778
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:26,530
So I have w dot P all set.

779
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,649
I know W six. I know
W this is a given.

780
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,049
The M dot was
also a given,

781
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,249
so I'm going to set there.

782
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:35,609
The.inThe q.in.

783
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:48,350
Right? So my q.in
here is equal

784
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:54,429
to my.h4 minus my

785
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:56,269
H three, which I think
I had already written.

786
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:57,149
Where did I write it?

787
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,230
Yeah, I already
wrote it here.

788
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,789
Let me start highlighting
some things.

789
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:04,369
So my q.in I had here.

790
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:08,849
All right. So with
my q.in, I'm good.

791
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:12,489
With my W dot propulsion
there, I'm good.

792
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:16,409
So my efficiency is
good. This is done.

793
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:21,809
The velocity at state six,

794
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:24,889
right, we determined
through here.

795
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:27,249
All right. So this
is also done.

796
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:32,559
And, um, If we come
here at state five,

797
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,399
okay, I need to determine

798
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:41,000
the temperature
and the pressure.

799
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,399
And so what do I know?

800
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,960
I can start stringing
things together,

801
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,479
but certainly what I know

802
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:48,000
is I know the entropy.

803
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,800
I know basically
my entropy

804
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,079
at state five. All right.

805
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,859
Yes.

806
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:03,420
And I would
have determined

807
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,660
H five from here, right?

808
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,979
So H five, I would have

809
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,740
determined through
this analysis.

810
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,019
So by knowing the
entropy specific entropy

811
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:14,219
at state five and the
enthropy at state five,

812
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,980
because this is a
pure substance,

813
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,179
I have complete
information,

814
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,580
and then from Pcolorn
dot notation,

815
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,419
I have T and pure.

816
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,499
Okay? All right.

817
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,220
Yeah, and if you want
to substitute numbers,

818
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,899
pull that up and
look at that, okay?

819
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,459
But that's roughly
what you need to know.

820
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:32,299
So what are they take

821
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,139
home message and
et propulsion?

822
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,060
Many things are
isentropic.

823
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,939
So the diffuser,
the compressor,

824
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:39,380
the turbine,
and the nozzle,

825
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,139
isentropic, okay?

826
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,019
So it means adiabatic,

827
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:44,400
and it means reversible.

828
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,539
One key piece
of information.

829
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:48,379
The second thing is
we treat this as

830
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:50,260
stationary for the
purposes of the analysis.

831
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,539
So we have this and

832
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:55,099
our inlet velocity
then is W one,

833
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,579
that's obvious, but
then we set that

834
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:58,260
equal to the velocity
of the aircraft,

835
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,819
okay? You need
to recall that.

836
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:01,379
Everything else
you've done,

837
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:02,579
you've done steady flow

838
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:03,859
analysis of a diffuser,

839
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:06,540
a compressor, a
heat exchanger,

840
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,460
which we do the standard

841
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,899
error assumptions for.

842
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,739
You've done turbine, and

843
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:13,779
you've also done
nozzle, right?

844
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,069
So each of these
individually is there.

845
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:17,599
The next key part
of it, which

846
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,319
sets it apart from
the other analyses

847
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:21,000
is all of the work
out of the turbine

848
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,399
you put into
the compressor.

849
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:24,440
So there is no network,

850
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,919
net shaft work out
of the system, okay?

851
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,879
So you use that then to

852
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,279
that fact to determine the

853
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,479
enthalpy at state five,

854
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:36,520
what's exiting
on the turbine.

855
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,119
And that's pretty
much it. Yes, please.

856
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,509
No, you start like a

857
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:47,830
good book at
the beginning.

858
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:52,749
All right. So,
what do we know?

859
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:54,109
Yeah, let's walk
through that.

860
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:55,869
So what you know is the
inlet temperature and

861
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:57,869
the limb pressure
that you're given.

862
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:00,349
T and P one, you know,

863
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:03,149
T and P one, you know,

864
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:04,589
so you have complete
information

865
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:06,549
about that state.

866
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:08,829
State two, you're
told this,

867
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:10,149
you're told that
the pressure

868
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:10,949
at state three is

869
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:13,470
ten times P two, and
it's isontropic.

870
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,789
S three is S two.

871
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,669
So I have pressure. I have

872
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:21,149
specific um Oh,
I'm sorry, here.

873
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:24,309
So S two is
equal to S one.

874
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,549
Let me back up a second.

875
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:32,509
So T one and T one we
have. That's good.

876
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:33,669
For state two, you know,

877
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:36,109
the specific entropy at
state two is equal to

878
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:41,669
the specific entropy
at state one.

879
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:44,629
And you also know
the pressure, right?

880
00:36:44,629 --> 00:36:45,309
You basically know,

881
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,549
I'm sorry, not
the pressure.

882
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,669
You know, the enthalpy
at state two.

883
00:36:48,669 --> 00:36:50,229
So with the
specific entropy

884
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:51,549
and enthalpy at state two,

885
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:53,414
you have complete
information of state two.

886
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:55,159
All right? So it means you

887
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,799
know the pressure at
state two, right?

888
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:58,199
The pressure at
state three is

889
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,079
ten times P two,
so you have that.

890
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,879
S three is S two,
now state three.

891
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:10,569
Okay, State, um, State
four here, okay?

892
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:12,289
So for state four,

893
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:15,129
you are given it was
stated in the problem,

894
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:16,489
but you were given the

895
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:19,889
temperature at state four.

896
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:24,329
And this is an isobaric
process, right?

897
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:27,329
So the state the pressure

898
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:28,569
at state four is
going to be equal

899
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:29,649
to the pressure
at state three.

900
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:30,929
To the point that was
brought up before,

901
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:31,649
you could also treat

902
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,089
that isochorically if you

903
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:35,449
were doing a
detonation process.

904
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:39,164
So this is solved here.
You know, state four.

905
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:41,759
Inlet here, right?
So four to five,

906
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,359
you know that this
is isentropic.

907
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,279
So you know the
entropy at State five.

908
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:46,879
And from this analysis of

909
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,799
all the workout goes
into the compressor,

910
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,479
you can determine the
enthropy at state five.

911
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:53,479
Now I have enthalpy and
I have entropy next.

912
00:37:53,479 --> 00:38:01,119
Onto onto State six.

913
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,639
So I'm holding
the wrong one.

914
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,639
Hold on. State six.

915
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,759
So for State six, then,

916
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:12,799
what you know is that
it's isentropic, right?

917
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,079
So S six is
equal to S five,

918
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:20,039
and P six is
equal to what?

919
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,019
Yeah, it's the
exit, right?

920
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,179
It's basically back
out to there, right?

921
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:26,619
So P six is P one,

922
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:28,619
and then you have
that there. Okay?

923
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,539
But again, I
would say all of

924
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:31,459
the previous things that

925
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:32,499
we had done would allow

926
00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:34,459
you to string together

927
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,980
that process. Other
questions about t?

928
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,779
Yes, please. Yeah, you're

929
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,260
told the velocity
of an aircraft.

930
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,499
Yeah. So again, open
that, read it, and yeah.

931
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:49,270
Other questions? Yes,
please. You assume?

932
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,309
Because I want to

933
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:54,069
make this happen
in 40 minutes.

934
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:54,829
Okay.

935
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:56,389
But it's not unreasonable

936
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:57,909
if you think about like
you're moving, right?

937
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,189
So basically, I could

938
00:38:59,189 --> 00:39:01,789
have something that's not

939
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,109
moving and air
blowing at me,

940
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:04,669
or I could be moving,
and then the air

941
00:39:04,669 --> 00:39:06,109
essentially looks
stationary with

942
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:07,269
respect to me
flying, right?

943
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,749
So you could do one or
the other. There is

944
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:10,709
a reference frame,
right? Okay.

945
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:13,269
Other questions? Okay.

946
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:17,614
Great. Yeah, and think
about detonation.

947
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:18,959
Okay, how does it look

948
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,199
like if you want
to diagram that?

949
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,840
So again, what you need
to get into the habit

950
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,000
of doing now is
defining these states.

951
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,439
You know, use the
process classify

952
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,840
calor and make,
you know, plots.

953
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,239
So here, this kind
of illustrates

954
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,999
the isotropic nature of

955
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,439
literally every
process except

956
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,920
for the combustion
chamber.

957
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,279
So one to two
diffuser isotropic,

958
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:40,519
two to three,
compressor isotropic,

959
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,960
three to four
heat addition,

960
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,680
four to five
turbine isotropic,

961
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,359
five to six nozzle
isotropic, okay?

962
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,719
And check yourself, right?

963
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,729
Look at that and see.
Does that make sense?

964
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,379
Um, you can represent that

965
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:53,859
also in a PV
diagram, right?

966
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:54,819
We said that P one and

967
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:56,299
P six should be
the same, right?

968
00:39:56,299 --> 00:39:58,340
I'm going to
that. So that's

969
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,699
what you would
expect there.

970
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,099
I'd expect, you know,

971
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,060
something with a
higher specific volume

972
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,780
right at the at the exit
because it's hotter.

973
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,539
T six is hotter
than T one,

974
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,059
so there I'd
expect a higher

975
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:11,899
specific volume at
the exit, okay?

976
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:14,940
But three to four, heat
addition, isoberic.

977
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,499
That's what I'm looking
for there, okay?

978
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:17,699
So plot. This is

979
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:19,499
a graph this is a
graphing class.

980
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:22,909
All right. So If

981
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:23,789
you really want to be

982
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:24,869
efficient or you really,

983
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,350
really want to go
fast there, you'll

984
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,669
end up designing
probably something

985
00:40:27,669 --> 00:40:29,589
that looks like this
with all the need

986
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:31,829
of those different
components.

987
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,669
These are called ram
jets, all right?

988
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:35,630
My understanding,

989
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,990
I do not work
in this field,

990
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,190
but when I was a
student some years ago,

991
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,669
I was told these
things are

992
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:42,109
very hard to start, okay?

993
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:44,269
Once you get them going,
right, they can go,

994
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:46,669
but they are difficult to

995
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,470
basically start
from the ground,

996
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,869
but they can go
fast, they're light.

997
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:52,914
They're very efficient
there, okay?

998
00:40:52,914 --> 00:40:55,560
Towards the comment
about compressibility,

999
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,880
this is not the class
in compressibility.

1000
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,319
There have some
comments about

1001
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:00,439
that, like what it means.

1002
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,800
But in short,

1003
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,239
if you want to
make things that

1004
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,439
go supersonic,

1005
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:05,999
you need to have

1006
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,680
a very specific
type of nozzle.

1007
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,759
This is called the D
Laval nozzle, right?

1008
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,079
Gustav De LaVall was

1009
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:13,759
a Swedish guy who
made milk, okay?

1010
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:15,360
Alpha Laval.

1011
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,389
Has anyone heard of
Alpha Laval? Is anyone?

1012
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:20,109
Okay, they make
heat exchangers.

1013
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:20,829
They're still a company.

1014
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,389
That's the Laval
I believe that's

1015
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:23,989
the Laval in the name.

1016
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,030
But if you want to make
something that goes

1017
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,269
faster than the speed of

1018
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:28,789
sound, this is what
you need to do.

1019
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:32,790
You have a converging,
diverging nozzle.

1020
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,869
So you bring in
a fluid to here,

1021
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,829
and this is all what's
called subsonic.

1022
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,189
So it's moving
at aeed that's

1023
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:41,834
less than the
speed of sound.

1024
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:44,319
You compress the heck
out of this until it

1025
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,000
hits the throat here,
okay? The throat.

1026
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,560
At the throat,
you're moving sonic.

1027
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,599
You are at Mach one.
Alright, Mach one.

1028
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:54,799
At this condition, if

1029
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,119
you do any further, right,

1030
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,720
try to put any
further additions

1031
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,599
into pressure, more
will not move through.

1032
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,200
Because it's a throat,
it becomes choked.

1033
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,939
You are choked, okay?

1034
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,599
Out of this at the
back end there,

1035
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,839
this is where things can
then get supersonic.

1036
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:10,919
So everything that
you put in, and

1037
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,199
you compress the
hell out of it,

1038
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,319
at the end of
that it will be

1039
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:14,759
allowed to expand
and it moves.

1040
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:16,519
The analysis of
this can be done,

1041
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,080
and it is also isentropic.

1042
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,719
So these types of

1043
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,359
nozzles are
called isotropic.

1044
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:21,959
There are other ones
that are isenthalpic.

1045
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,239
That's what we work
with when we do

1046
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,760
research, isenthalpic.

1047
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,599
But these things can be

1048
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,239
modeled and all of that.

1049
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,480
We're working
on a section,

1050
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,960
especially for
the aero students

1051
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,759
of some content towards

1052
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:31,999
the end of the
semester that we

1053
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,400
can give you on
Prairie Learn,

1054
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,479
some additional
reading and

1055
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:35,079
some stuff to have.

1056
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:37,794
So at least you know
the terminology, okay?

1057
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:41,989
All right. I will
go through this.

1058
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:44,349
I won't be able to do
the full thing for it.

1059
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:45,829
I expect you to read this.

1060
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,389
I spent a lot of
time with this

1061
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:47,909
going through

1062
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:49,509
the analysis and
the derivation,

1063
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:51,030
but the too
long and didn't

1064
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,389
read is that until now

1065
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:53,509
I haven't really given you

1066
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:55,509
a cycle that is
Carne, okay?

1067
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,029
You've done
elements of it.

1068
00:42:57,029 --> 00:42:58,389
If you remember
when I told you,

1069
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:00,309
Hey, here was this
piston cylinder,

1070
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:01,789
I put heat in, and there's

1071
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:02,509
an equal amount of

1072
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:03,869
work that's
transferred out.

1073
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:05,749
This is the first stage of

1074
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,829
what's called the
Sterling cycle, okay?

1075
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:08,949
So I do the heat in

1076
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:11,109
and the workout
isothermally.

1077
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:15,769
Ar? I then, um
at that point.

1078
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:18,329
So I'm doing heat
in and work out,

1079
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,930
and I'm doing that
isothermally, alright?

1080
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,050
That's good.
The next stage

1081
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,129
in the process as I allow

1082
00:43:25,129 --> 00:43:27,969
um I allow basically

1083
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:31,729
my device to expand
and cool, okay?

1084
00:43:31,729 --> 00:43:33,489
So I do go adiabatic
expansion.

1085
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:34,929
So there's some work
transferred out,

1086
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:38,769
and I allow my device
to cool, all right?

1087
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:40,809
And then the third step is

1088
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:42,529
essentially I compress it,

1089
00:43:42,529 --> 00:43:43,689
and while I'm compressing

1090
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:44,769
it, it's heating up,

1091
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:45,889
so I transfer heat out,

1092
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,170
right, at constant
temperature.

1093
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,050
So I cool isothermally.

1094
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,409
And then I continue
to compress

1095
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:53,490
reversibly, but
adiabatically.

1096
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,809
So it means that
I warm up I

1097
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:58,969
warm up my system.
All right.

1098
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,929
So all of that's
fine and well.

1099
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:04,249
But if you really
want to get this

1100
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:06,679
to be a uh,

1101
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,549
like a carnal, basically a

1102
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:10,910
carnal level
of efficiency.

1103
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,230
That process
of the cooling

1104
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,109
and the heating there,

1105
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:16,869
you would love to have

1106
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:18,069
what's called
a regenerator.

1107
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:19,549
So if you remember
last time when

1108
00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:21,310
we were talking about
the Braden cycle,

1109
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,829
the purpose of
a regenerator

1110
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,869
is that you get
to have yourself

1111
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:26,509
kind of like a
boost or like

1112
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:28,269
a heating effect or
a cooling effect

1113
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:30,149
without actually having to

1114
00:44:30,149 --> 00:44:32,109
put extra heat into
the system, okay?

1115
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:33,709
So what does one of
these cycles look like?

1116
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:35,229
So there's two
types. One is

1117
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:37,349
Sterling and one
is Ericsson, okay?

1118
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:41,659
Sterling is essentially a

1119
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:43,209
almost like if you think,

1120
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:44,129
you know, a closed system.

1121
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:46,049
So it's a piston
cylinder one, okay?

1122
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,969
That gets you to
Carn efficiency.

1123
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:50,170
Ericsson is like a
steady flow device,

1124
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,529
turbines, compressor
heat exchangers, right?

1125
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:54,769
So it's like Sterling is

1126
00:44:54,769 --> 00:44:58,570
like kind of like an
auto or a diesel cycle,

1127
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,689
but, like, as efficient
as it can be.

1128
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:03,849
Ericsson is
like a Brayton,

1129
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:05,289
somewhat like a Brayton,

1130
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,569
but as efficient as
that can be, right?

1131
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:08,689
It basically gets you to

1132
00:45:08,689 --> 00:45:10,579
Karin, right? All right.

1133
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,539
So step one, as
I mentioned,

1134
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:17,619
you have heat in and
workout. Great, ar?

1135
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:19,579
You then continue to

1136
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:24,139
expand adiabatically
there.

1137
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,339
You then slide
this whole thing

1138
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,699
over a regenerator.

1139
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:31,179
You basically slide
this whole thing

1140
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:33,939
over a regenerator here,

1141
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,379
which absorbs some
of the heat, okay?

1142
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:38,759
What would this
look like? You want

1143
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:40,439
to patent, like,
figure it out.

1144
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:41,159
Like, go in and

1145
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:42,479
look and come up
with a good idea.

1146
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:43,839
This could be
something that's like

1147
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,679
a metal foam, right?

1148
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,359
But the idea
is that when I

1149
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,519
move that hot fluid
over this thing,

1150
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,800
it retains some of
that heat and cools

1151
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,640
down and cools
down the fluid.

1152
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,639
Again, you continue with

1153
00:45:57,639 --> 00:45:59,799
your right, the
movement to the end.

1154
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,079
So now this is this gas

1155
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:02,199
is at a low temperature.

1156
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:02,879
He was high.

1157
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:04,560
I transfer heat into
the regenerator.

1158
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,559
I'm at a low. And now

1159
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,479
what I do is I
transfer work in,

1160
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,799
I compress, and then I
take heat out, okay?

1161
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:13,689
Um, you know,

1162
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:15,369
and then I sort of,
like, go back, right?

1163
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:16,489
The slide this thing

1164
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:17,729
back over the regenerator.

1165
00:46:17,729 --> 00:46:19,289
I warm it back up, and I

1166
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:21,049
start from the
beginning, okay?

1167
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:22,729
But the key element is if

1168
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:24,609
you want to get
something, again,

1169
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:26,329
either a closed
system type of

1170
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:27,809
piston cylinder device or

1171
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:28,970
a steady flow device,

1172
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:29,649
if you really want to

1173
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:31,249
approach
carnoefficiencies,

1174
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:33,289
you have to have an
element that can

1175
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,730
store energy thermally
within the cycle,

1176
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,009
okay?

1177
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:38,689
We call that
regeneration, right?

1178
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:41,299
Again, Yeah. This
will make more sense.

1179
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,339
I think when we get into

1180
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:46,499
the end of Lecture
ten, if I have time,

1181
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:48,740
then I'll try to go
through and then derive

1182
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,379
maybe the Sterling
cycle and go

1183
00:46:50,379 --> 00:46:52,099
through a detailed
analysis with it, right?

1184
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:54,779
But to get to be
Carne, right?

1185
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,539
With this system, you'll
be able to show that

1186
00:46:57,539 --> 00:46:59,339
essentially
that you'll get

1187
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:01,099
an efficiency,
which is, you know,

1188
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:05,340
one over L divided by H,

1189
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,499
if you analyze this there,

1190
00:47:07,499 --> 00:47:09,059
and it's only possible
because you have

1191
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,219
this regeneration
step there.

1192
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:12,139
Okay?

1193
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:15,140
All right. Other
questions?

1194
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,739
Okay, this is what
it would look like.

1195
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:18,499
Again, I'm going to do

1196
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:19,659
the analysis,
but in short,

1197
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:21,140
this is what your
temperature entropy

1198
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,539
diagrams look
like one to two.

1199
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,499
And this whole process
of how do I go 4-1

1200
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:26,979
and warm up without heat

1201
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:28,979
addition, it's, you know,

1202
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,379
all of that, you know,

1203
00:47:31,379 --> 00:47:32,819
area under the curve here,

1204
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,859
essentially transferring
heat over into this.

1205
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:37,059
This is how you do it.

1206
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:38,419
Alright? Okay, with that,

1207
00:47:38,419 --> 00:47:40,539
I'm going to close
like 1 minute early.

1208
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:41,939
So if you have
questions, I'm up

1209
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:44,939
here there. Thank you.
