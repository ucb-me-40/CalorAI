1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Alright, I got 210.
Let's get started.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,399
So today, energy analysis
of closed systems.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,320
So quiz one.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,400
It's coming like winter,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,440
all right, in some
parts of the world.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,000
Basically, right, you're
going to take this

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,519
at the computer based
testing facility.

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,200
Click that link.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,719
You can learn about
it. It's wonderful.

10
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,200
You'll be able to
start registering

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,644
for this on the 25th.

12
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:24,289
Look to Quiz one page.

13
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,489
This is one stop shopping.

14
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,329
So all the stuff you want

15
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,289
to see, details are there.

16
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:28,649
So you're welcome to

17
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,769
email me or the GSIs,
but please just,

18
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,610
have a look at
that before asking

19
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,489
because it might be

20
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,169
able to answer
your question

21
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,370
much quicker than I
will be able to reply.

22
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,610
We have four problems.

23
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,609
I'm not going to read them

24
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,610
here, but yeah,
essentially,

25
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,569
this is what you'll
be asked to do today,

26
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:46,770
we're going to talk
about Adbtic expansion

27
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,929
in one of the
problems, okay?

28
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,929
Module one review
is posted today.

29
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:52,329
So if you want to
generate, like,

30
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,969
practice quizzes and get

31
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,049
into game shape with it,

32
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:55,849
you'll be able to do that.

33
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:57,409
So just go to
the P one module

34
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,650
and review how this works.

35
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,929
When you click
on it, right?

36
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:00,889
It's going to generate

37
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:02,369
these four questions
that are for you.

38
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:04,129
You can take that, and
then you can go up

39
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,049
and click it again and

40
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,289
generate new ones, right?

41
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:08,809
So for those who are yeah,

42
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:12,969
like quizzes, that's
what you can do, right?

43
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,889
And the way the point
of this is that this is

44
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:15,689
exactly how it'll look

45
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:16,890
like then on
the assessment.

46
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,049
So the way you
look at this,

47
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,209
also the workbooks
and all of that,

48
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:22,329
it should be like one
to one with it, right?

49
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,529
Okay, so after
today, right,

50
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:26,249
we're going to be
able to do PDV work

51
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:28,769
for kind of commonly
encountered things.

52
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:31,489
You know, you're going
to be able to say that

53
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:32,769
basically the first law is

54
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,370
conservation of energy.

55
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,929
And then, again,
I'm going to

56
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,249
continue with
practicing how to

57
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:40,130
do general energy balances

58
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,450
to control volumes.

59
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,369
This kind of
repetition, okay?

60
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,089
Okay, so why do we
care about that?

61
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:49,859
Um, Oh, sweet. Okay.

62
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,979
That playback isn't there.

63
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,420
So now you get to use
your imagination.

64
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,259
This worked last
year. D's here.

65
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,459
He could tell you if
this video worked.

66
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,140
Anyway, so piston
basically piston

67
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,819
or PDV work, this kind
of boundary work.

68
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,739
It's pretty much how we

69
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,739
move everything
still, right?

70
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,939
We have electrification,

71
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,900
but everything that's
like terrestrial,

72
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,540
so that means like,
not an airplane,

73
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,540
like long haul trucking,
internal combustion,

74
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,940
all basically
involves, right,

75
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,300
this expansion and
contraction with it,

76
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,500
right?

77
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,300
So engines, compressors,
and things of that,

78
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,080
um you know, nature. Okay?

79
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,119
So these little devices,

80
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,599
the pistons and
the piston side,

81
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,679
that's what we've
been looking at

82
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,319
and why it's important.

83
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,240
Okay. Maybe I'll try
it in the browser.

84
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,880
Are we brave? I think
it's noisy, though.

85
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,239
Okay, Howden, I don't
know what Howden is.

86
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,279
Yeah, there we
go. Let's see.

87
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,279
Do we have sound?
That doesn't

88
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,014
give me sound.
That's terrible.

89
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:49,629
It's only on mine. Okay.
And it's fun music.

90
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:50,750
Anyways, yeah, so you can,

91
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,510
like, have a look and see,

92
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,790
there's lots of, you know,

93
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,550
neat things out there.

94
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,150
But, you know,
this is sort of,

95
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,710
you know, super
important for movement.

96
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,949
You know, it's
kind of like

97
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,470
how an engine
takes a step.

98
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,870
Also, if're like, really

99
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,030
into if you're
like a real, like,

100
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,070
big nerd like meaner and
steam engines, like,

101
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,189
you can go see this
stuff at, like,

102
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,350
Tilton Park, right?

103
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,509
So they have, like, legit

104
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:10,790
operating steam engines.

105
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,869
I think they run on oil,

106
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,229
though, not coal with it.

107
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:14,630
But if you want to, like,

108
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,789
really geek out
about trains

109
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,109
and all that, like,
you can go and see,

110
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:19,910
you know, essentially
the piston movement

111
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,470
and stuff they have there.

112
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,510
Okay. Surely, you have

113
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,430
better things to do on
a Friday than that.

114
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,030
Um Yeah, so again,

115
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,870
we're talking about the
moving boundary work.

116
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,270
Some clarifications,
though, right?

117
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,630
So in cars, you know,

118
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,789
in that, these things
tend to move quickly.

119
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,790
You know, if you
ever, like, read

120
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,309
like a tachometer
on, like, a vehicle,

121
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:42,550
like internal
combustion, right,

122
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,149
you're measuring
essentially, like

123
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:45,910
thousands of RPMs, right?

124
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,069
It means like a movement

125
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,310
like that is
probably going,

126
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,990
you know, ten times
in a second, right?

127
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,470
At least sort of ten
times in a second.

128
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,990
And that is
definitely not,

129
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,269
right, equilibrium.

130
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,580
However, it's not
too bad, right?

131
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,300
The assumptions that
we'll make are basically

132
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,419
not um, you know, too bad.

133
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,140
And really, the
goal of thermo

134
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,380
is for us to kind
of see what is,

135
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,180
like, the right direction.

136
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,819
So even if you make
these assumptions,

137
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,539
you know, with the math

138
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:11,540
and the physics there,

139
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,739
we get to really know
if we're kind of moving

140
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,619
into a right, you
know, direction.

141
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:19,299
But for the purposes
of this analysis,

142
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:20,300
we have to start
somewhere.

143
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,220
So we start with kind of

144
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,539
quasi equilibrium with it.

145
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,984
Okay? All right, um,

146
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:28,149
So how do we, like,
classify this?

147
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,669
So there's a couple of

148
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,269
different terms
that'll come up.

149
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:34,429
One here that we see is

150
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:36,309
this term sort
of polytropic.

151
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,749
I'll get into
a second what

152
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:40,669
that, you know, means.

153
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,149
But, you know, when

154
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,749
we're thinking
about work, right?

155
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:45,269
So this sort of
boundary work

156
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,469
or expansion work that's,

157
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:49,269
you know, that's
there, right,

158
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,334
is the integral of what?

159
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,839
PDV, right? So basically,

160
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,439
you have P dV, right?

161
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,559
And the name of
the game here,

162
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:00,799
in order to do this
integral is we need

163
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,599
to know pressure as

164
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,159
a function of
volume, right?

165
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,559
So we want some
function here,

166
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,600
that's essentially,

167
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,119
right, the function
of the volume,

168
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,759
and then we do a
substitution, okay?

169
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,959
So this polytropic
is nothing

170
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,079
but let me make

171
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,719
sure I'm not getting

172
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:18,319
ahead of myself too quick.

173
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,239
All right. It's sort
of fair game now.

174
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,360
All right. Right? So we're

175
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,399
basically going to write
something like this.

176
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,919
We're going to say
pressure times

177
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,680
volume with volume to

178
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,839
the N exponent is

179
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,119
equal to a constant,
all right?

180
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:37,559
Now, this is
polytropic, okay?

181
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:40,359
Who can tell me
off the top of

182
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,080
their head maybe
something that looks

183
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,839
like PV equals something?

184
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,479
Sure. Name and
what's the answer?

185
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,039
Exactly. So what, though?

186
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,119
When would that be useful?

187
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:58,919
When would the NRT
equal to a constant?

188
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,859
Isothermal Isothermal.

189
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:05,099
So the isothermal case.

190
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,380
Exactly. The exponent is

191
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,819
what then in an
isothermal case.

192
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,219
N equals one.

193
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,980
Uno, right? Eins.

194
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,299
So N equals one, and
you have that, okay?

195
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,779
So that's one
of the cases.

196
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,379
We'll talk about two other

197
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,179
we'll talk about
another case later on,

198
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:19,820
which is where we have

199
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,499
no heat transfer,
adiabatic, okay?

200
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:22,219
And they're going to have

201
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,379
sort of a different
constant, okay?

202
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,459
But the sort of general
formula of PV to

203
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,019
the N equals a constant
is this polytropic,

204
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,420
you know,
polytropic process.

205
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,899
What I'm showing
you here is

206
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,299
the case of N
equals to one,

207
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:36,699
and that's your
isothermal case.

208
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,219
So as was mentioned there.

209
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:40,659
All right.

210
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,579
Okay. So if we
take this way,

211
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,860
we can do the
substitution.

212
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,860
So if we do the
substitution

213
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,459
there for the
polytropic, right?

214
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,499
So the boundary work
is then equal to

215
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,820
a constant times
an integral

216
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,179
from state one to
state two, right?

217
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:02,499
So I'll rearrange
this, right?

218
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,340
So basically, I
have a constant.

219
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,379
So P is equal
to a constant,

220
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,139
then divided by V
to the end, right?

221
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,660
So then what we'll
have is D V divided by

222
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,539
V to the end, okay?

223
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,549
That should be
an N. It's an N

224
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:25,269
there, right? All right?

225
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,869
And if we know state one,

226
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:32,989
so if we know state one,

227
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:34,509
which a lot of
times we do.

228
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:35,509
So what does that mean?

229
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:36,989
It means basically
if we know P

230
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,709
one and we know
and we know V one,

231
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,189
we can substitute that

232
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:44,029
for the constant, right?

233
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:47,149
Because you basically
you would have a, uh,

234
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:57,049
um, a C that's equal
to p1v1, right?

235
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:58,609
P1v1 to the N,

236
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,370
and if, right?
So that's fine.

237
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,970
So we can do the
substitution.

238
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,129
And if we have
isothermal, right?

239
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,609
As was just mentioned by

240
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,009
your classmate, right,

241
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:17,049
we'll have N equal
to one. All right.

242
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:21,269
And so if we do With
that N equals one,

243
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,149
I'll just write it out

244
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,749
just for clarity, right?

245
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:27,669
So boundary work
is then p1v1.

246
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,189
That's the
substitution for C.

247
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,790
We then have the integral

248
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,870
1-2 to two of

249
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,949
dv divided by V because
that's also there.

250
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:39,070
And so what you're
going to end

251
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,109
up with then is p1v1,

252
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:45,230
natural log natural log

253
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,110
of V two divided by
V one. All right?

254
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,149
Cool. And then that's
the plot, right?

255
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,550
So that's
essentially the plot

256
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,190
that you have there,

257
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,990
and where that right

258
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,180
What is the
integral of this?

259
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,980
What's the integral of

260
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,980
any variable dx
divided by X?

261
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
Natural log of X, and
in this case, right,

262
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
plus a constant, or

263
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,040
if I integrate
it 1-2, right?

264
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,759
So let's say it's 1-2,

265
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,160
then this would be X two

266
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,640
divided by X one, right?

267
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:43,839
Okay. So natural log

268
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,280
of V two divided by V one.

269
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,020
Good. Any questions
about that? All right.

270
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,500
And what's one way that

271
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,659
you could double
check yourself

272
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:59,300
on this area, right?

273
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,140
So use color.
Kindergarten.

274
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,019
I love coloring.

275
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,500
Okay? So you just go
in and there you need

276
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,580
color and you'll end up.

277
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,420
And then that area under

278
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,740
the curve then
should be equal

279
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,660
to what you have what
you have here, okay?

280
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,860
Great. So that's one case.

281
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,900
That's the isothermal
the isothermal case.

282
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,260
All right.

283
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,780
So I can move I guess
we can see with this.

284
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,180
Okay, the next one that's

285
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,540
important is the
isoberic, right?

286
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,259
So the isoberic case
is where we have

287
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,940
a constant, um, right,

288
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,100
a constant volume or

289
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,539
a constant pressure
expansion,

290
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,059
you know, process.

291
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:40,619
So, in that case, right,

292
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:41,860
if we define this as

293
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,859
the control volume,

294
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:44,980
we can do an
energy balance.

295
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,900
So we can do an energy
balance on that.

296
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,940
So the change in
the energy of,

297
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,900
let's say that
control volume.

298
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,379
So this dashed region

299
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,500
is equal to the
energy, right,

300
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,499
that we transfer in
minus the energy that

301
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:03,740
we transfer that we
transfer out, okay?

302
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,540
What are the
ways that energy

303
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,899
can change in
control volume?

304
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,300
Name? Cody and.

305
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,539
Right? So he would be
a transfer mechanism.

306
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:20,220
I would say, sorry,

307
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,500
we're transferring
energy in

308
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,820
and we're transferring
energy out.

309
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,100
So, what are ways
that we would

310
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,659
quantify changes
in the energy

311
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,699
of that control volume?

312
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:36,219
Energy, internal
energy, kinetic energy.

313
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:37,779
And because this is
a closed system,

314
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,740
will we have changes in

315
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,380
changes in mass or no?

316
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,340
No. For now,

317
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,780
I'm not going to
get too far ahead.

318
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,939
I love to foreshadow,

319
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,100
but that's a little
too far for me.

320
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,980
That'll be Week five.

321
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,340
All right. So we have
changes that can

322
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,860
change in energy
control volumes,

323
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,939
change internal energy,

324
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:53,979
change in kinetic energy,

325
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,300
change in
potential energy.

326
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,500
And then this is equal to

327
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,620
the ways we can transfer
energy in and out,

328
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,750
which is work,
W in plus Q in,

329
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,270
right, minus W out

330
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:13,229
plus Q Q out,
all right? Cool.

331
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:14,830
I won't have anything

332
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,869
to do with this, you know,

333
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:20,549
in, you know,
in these cases.

334
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,069
And obviously, if
we had sort of

335
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:24,150
heat transfer processes
and stuff involved,

336
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,390
which usually is the case,

337
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,390
when you do something

338
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,070
isoberically, you
could analyze it.

339
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,510
What I would like to
focus on, though,

340
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,190
here is the work

341
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,390
it's just the work
transferred out process.

342
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,549
I like to define I
like to define that.

343
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,779
And in the second
half of the lecture,

344
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,020
we'll get into
the combined heat

345
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,260
and work processes and

346
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,899
those changes in
internal energy.

347
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:54,060
Okay? So we'll
focus on the W out.

348
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,260
And in this case,

349
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,980
right, the only way
that we can have work

350
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,580
transferred out
of this system

351
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,500
is due to the
expansion, right?

352
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,300
So we can have the W
out here is again,

353
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,300
equal to the integral
from state one

354
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,419
to state two of P PDV.

355
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,700
So it's a constant
pressure process.

356
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,225
What can I do here?

357
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:22,149
No, this is not Jeopardy.

358
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,270
I'm like watching
Jeopardy.

359
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,390
I saw the same guy
answer the question,

360
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,270
like ten times in a row.

361
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,030
Your name? Hussain.
Say it again?

362
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,830
Hussein Hussein
The P, right?

363
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,269
So basically,
it's isobaric,

364
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,070
so it doesn't have a
dependence on volume

365
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,749
integral of one
to two of dV.

366
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:36,750
So then this is what?

367
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,150
This is pressure V
two minus V one.

368
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,790
And that's very
easy. I mean,

369
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,550
that's that's prek
stuff, right?

370
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,310
So basically, you
then just shade right

371
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,310
the area then
under, right?

372
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,230
Basically, you
shade the area

373
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,390
then under that, okay?

374
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,590
So that's isobaric.
So we did what?

375
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,790
Isothermal? We
did isobaric.

376
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,830
Um And what I would
like to do now

377
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,750
is go to another
important case,

378
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,629
which is the adiabatic.

379
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,710
Are there any
questions about this

380
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,949
before I do adabetic?

381
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,230
All good?

382
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,990
Okay. Based on your
answers on that,

383
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,430
I think you guys get this.

384
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,390
All right, let me erase.

385
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,869
Let me erase.

386
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,470
All right.

387
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,190
Okay.

388
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:54,010
Cool. Yes, please.

389
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,489
What is a
polytropic process?

390
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,410
Polytropic. I don't know

391
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,570
enough Greek to
say what it means.

392
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,329
I mean, what it
means is this PVN

393
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,730
is C. So an ME 40,

394
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,369
this is what polytropic
means to you.

395
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,090
Well, I mean, so now

396
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,130
I'll give you
cases, right?

397
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,930
I give you basically
physical versions,

398
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,130
right?

399
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,250
So, you know, so,

400
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,610
you know, what is when

401
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,250
N equals zero,
what is that case?

402
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,570
Which is? How do we

403
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,650
call that isobaric, right?

404
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:36,170
When N equals one
we had Which was?

405
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,449
Isothermal Isothermal.

406
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:43,090
Okay? So I'm going to
give you the last case,

407
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,130
which is adiabatic, okay?

408
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,490
And then I'm going
to think and

409
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,930
figure out if I know
any other ends.

410
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,849
But I know 01,

411
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:49,930
and then what I'm
going to tell you,

412
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,130
I think for air is
like 1.4, okay?

413
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,890
Cool. Other questions?

414
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,290
That's a nice
question. I'll think.

415
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,810
You maybe think
over the weekend,

416
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,930
you know? Okay. All right.

417
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:08,330
Um, Okay, so
idiabatic All right,

418
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,769
so we have our right,

419
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:10,890
we have our
schematic there,

420
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,930
and I'm already
showing you,

421
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,609
right, kind of what the
process looks like.

422
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:16,530
In this case, I'm

423
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,609
doing a compression
process.

424
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,250
So I have adiabatic.

425
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,689
What I'm showing here is,

426
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,850
why am I showing you a
compression process?

427
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,369
Because I plotted
it wrong.

428
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:27,930
What I have here
is the expansion.

429
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,529
But basically, right,
this is compression.

430
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,210
If it went BA that
would be the um,

431
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,290
that would be the
expansion, all right?

432
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,570
And what I want to

433
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,850
prove to you, so
in this problem,

434
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,020
is that, um, PV to.

435
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,179
Yeah. So basically PV,

436
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,940
what I want to prove
a problem statement

437
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,500
or show, maybe
I'll say show.

438
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,260
Proof feels like
a strong word.

439
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,220
Show that P V to

440
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,859
some constant Gamma is

441
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:07,779
equal to a constant
C, okay? All right?

442
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,579
We've already worked
with this, right?

443
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,699
The N equals zero,

444
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,059
the N equals one, right?

445
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:12,819
So what I'm saying

446
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,739
here is that this
is basically

447
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:15,900
the N equals Gamma,

448
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,700
N equals Gamma
case, all right?

449
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,779
I'm not going to draw the

450
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:20,779
schematic since
it exists there.

451
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,179
What am I going
to assume, right?

452
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:27,740
So I assume that
we have ideal gas.

453
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,259
So we have an ideal
gas inside of

454
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,820
the inside of that
control volume.

455
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,139
We have no heat
transfer, all right?

456
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,090
And that's what
adiabatic means.

457
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,249
So in other parts
of the course,

458
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,450
when I say adiabatic,

459
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,929
I mean no heat in or

460
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,889
out of my control
volume, all right?

461
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:51,010
We're going to neglect

462
00:17:51,730 --> 00:18:01,250
Delta KE and Delta PE.

463
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,889
And we're going
to say that

464
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:09,490
work is transferred.

465
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:18,330
Through expansion.

466
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,849
All right, so I don't have

467
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,529
any wires or anything
like that in there.

468
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,089
We're just talking
about expansion, right?

469
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,770
So P dV.

470
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,809
All right.

471
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,569
Okay.

472
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,090
Yeah, so what are
the physical laws

473
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,569
that we have involved
with this, right?

474
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:46,729
So what laws are
we talking about?

475
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:47,689
We're going to talk about

476
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:50,490
the conservation
of energy.

477
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:06,329
All right. A ideal guess.

478
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:15,769
Mm hmm, mm, mm. Okay.

479
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,050
So with this,
we can go on.

480
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,090
So what we'll
start with is,

481
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,689
we'll start with our
conservation of energy.

482
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:22,449
That's usually how
we begin with this.

483
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:23,809
And then after that, we'll

484
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,449
apply some ideal
gas relation.

485
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,009
And then from that,
if you wanted,

486
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:28,370
you could start
to substitute

487
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,249
properties and
insert to produce

488
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:33,809
plots and stuff
like that. Okay?

489
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,609
So our conservation
of energy, right,

490
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,130
is we have a Delta E CV.

491
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,769
So the control
volume I'm talking

492
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:41,729
about here is the
dashed red line.

493
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:43,049
So the change in
the energy of

494
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,409
that control
volume is equal to

495
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:52,849
E N minus E out, right?

496
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:54,010
The way that
this can change,

497
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,930
right is we'll have

498
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:02,609
Delta U plus Delta
K plus Delta P.

499
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,530
So changes in
internal energy,

500
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,049
kinetic energy
and potential

501
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,490
is equal to the ways

502
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,009
that we can transfer
energy in and out

503
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,610
of its system, which
is just work in heat.

504
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:18,569
So I'll W in plus
Q in minus W,

505
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,079
minus Q out, right?

506
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,120
Do I have another color?

507
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,039
I do. All right.

508
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,840
So this is out, right
from our assumptions,

509
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,879
and this is out.
What else is out?

510
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:37,719
Yes, please? I'm sorry.

511
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,120
Yes. Thank you
for catching

512
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,279
that. You got my back.

513
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,199
I appreciate that.
Comments on this?

514
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,640
Okay, so what else goes?

515
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,479
Actually, would that
have even have mattered?

516
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,279
No, right?

517
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,359
Because you don't have

518
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,519
any heat
transferred, right?

519
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,239
And if we assume
this to be, right?

520
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,720
If we assume this to be
an expansion process,

521
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,879
what does it mean
for W in and W out?

522
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,680
Louder.

523
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,999
W is zero.

524
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,639
W is zero. Exactly.
All right.

525
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:12,000
So then if we assume
that it's expansion,

526
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,559
then we only have work we

527
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,639
only have workout, right?

528
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,119
Cool. All right, so

529
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,879
then our Delta U, right
from this, right?

530
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:25,440
Our Delta U is equal
to the negative

531
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,039
of W equals to the
negative W out,

532
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,599
right? Do, do, do.

533
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,969
Okay, so we can write

534
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,130
this in differential form.

535
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,889
So I can say
that d, um, um,

536
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:55,809
d is then equal
to Delta W, um,

537
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,130
the negative of, uh, uh,

538
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,249
Delta W, um, out, which,

539
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:03,769
with our assumption
of this only being

540
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:05,330
boundary work is
basically the equal

541
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,729
to the negative of P
dv, all right? Okay.

542
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,919
Um, So that all
looks fine and well.

543
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:14,279
But what we need to do to

544
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,479
make this work is we need

545
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,719
to deal with

546
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:21,079
this internal energy
term here, okay?

547
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,239
And the way that we
can deal with this is

548
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:26,480
we can recall the changes

549
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,439
in internal energy for

550
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,000
any control volume that's
at constant volume.

551
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,599
So forget this. Changes in

552
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,959
internal energy for

553
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:38,959
a constant volume is
equal to CV dt, okay?

554
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,239
So if you remember
the definition of

555
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:45,000
the specific heat
at constant volume,

556
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,279
right, this is d dt
for constant V, okay?

557
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,599
And that's right.

558
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,119
And the way that we
introduced this,

559
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,119
right, is we had said

560
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,159
that, you know, basically,

561
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,295
when you analyze
a control volume,

562
00:23:01,295 --> 00:23:03,829
where you don't allow
the boundary to move,

563
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:05,550
the relationship
between internal

564
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,990
energy is equal to Cv dt.

565
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,950
All right? That's
definition. Bless you.

566
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,109
Okay? So what this

567
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:13,189
means is we can
rearrange this,

568
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:15,309
and I want to write
this as little U.

569
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:18,869
So D, little U dt because
this is a little C,

570
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,949
is that d so change

571
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:26,390
internal energy of
the control volume

572
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,709
there is equal to

573
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:33,989
CV little Cv
times dt, okay?

574
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,009
And what I will be able to

575
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:39,409
do up here then is to
substitute this in.

576
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:41,369
To here, I can write the M

577
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:48,610
little d is equal to
the negative of P dv.

578
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,450
And then I can
substitute into

579
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,129
that little d,
the CvdT, right?

580
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:56,010
So then I have M, Cv dt

581
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:01,009
is equal to the negative
of P dv. All right.

582
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,929
And we'd like to get
rid of temperature now.

583
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,009
So basically,
now we'd like

584
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:13,170
to get rid of temperature,

585
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,770
and this is where we
use the ideal gas

586
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,609
for the ideal
gas law, okay?

587
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,969
So I can write the
ideal gas law,

588
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:23,690
right is PV is equal
to M times RT,

589
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,450
where R is the
specific gas constant.

590
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,490
And I can write
a differential,

591
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:38,174
a D on both sides like
that, okay? All right.

592
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:40,259
On the left hand side, we

593
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:41,419
got to use a chain
roll, right?

594
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:43,860
So this is basically
going to be V dp

595
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,820
plus P dv.

596
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,940
This is equal to
M is a constant.

597
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,579
We don't have
mass in or out.

598
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,900
The constant
is a constant.

599
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,619
And so what you
have left is then

600
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:59,739
r dt, all right?

601
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:01,859
And we can rearrange.

602
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:03,700
So if I just put the
m to the other side,

603
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,220
I can have dt is
then equal to V dp

604
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:14,619
plus P dv divided
by R, all right?

605
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,690
So if we combine

606
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,089
this and the equation
I have over there,

607
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,194
maybe I'll go full screen.

608
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:26,579
What that have?

609
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:33,499
Okay? So if I combine
this and this,

610
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:43,660
I can write that M
Cv times up here,

611
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:50,899
V dp plus P dv
divided by R, right?

612
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:53,259
So that's nothing but
cv dt from before,

613
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,940
and then that's
going to be equal to

614
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,460
the negative of P dv.

615
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,269
All right? Okay. I'll
spare you the details.

616
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:05,829
You can click through
the link and see, like,

617
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,949
sort of the full steps,

618
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:09,270
but I'd like to

619
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,469
organize this in
the following way.

620
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:15,309
So I want to
write that I have

621
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:19,469
CV plus R divided by

622
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:23,789
Cv times dv divided by

623
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,710
V plus dp divided

624
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,629
by P is equal
to zero, okay?

625
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,020
And again, this is

626
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,459
just rearranging
with this.

627
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:41,299
If I take the
integral of that.

628
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,419
And if we assume that

629
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:46,979
the specific heaps
are constant,

630
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:54,669
so we could write
here, constant CV.

631
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:59,270
All right. What you're

632
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,869
going to have is
that CV plus R

633
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:08,749
divided by CV times
the natural log of

634
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:12,070
V plus the natural log

635
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,949
of P is equal to
a constant, okay?

636
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:16,189
Because that's what
this is, right?

637
00:27:16,189 --> 00:27:16,869
I pulled this out.

638
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,270
This is a natural log.
That's a natural log.

639
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,379
Um, This here we

640
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:25,020
can call as a
constant Gamma.

641
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,780
So we'll call CV plus

642
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,419
the gas constant
divided by CV as Gamma.

643
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,820
And one of the properties
is a natural log

644
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,979
is right I can put this to

645
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:35,139
the power of that, right?

646
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:38,619
So I can write
natural log of V to

647
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:40,939
the power Gamma plus

648
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:44,219
natural log of P
is equal to C.

649
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:45,899
And another nice
thing about

650
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:47,499
logs is that
when I add them,

651
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,379
I can multiply
them, right?

652
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:52,619
So here I can write
natural log of P,

653
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,534
V to the Gamma
is equal to C.

654
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:58,569
If I take the exponent

655
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:00,769
of exponential of
both sides, right?

656
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:03,049
I can add basically PV to

657
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,489
the Gamma is equal to

658
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:06,689
the exponential
of a constant,

659
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:07,969
which is basically
equal to

660
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,609
some new constant, right?

661
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:11,169
The exponential
of a constant is

662
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:14,370
basically a
constant, right?

663
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,250
Basically constant.

664
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,889
And that's it, okay?

665
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,730
And so PV to the Gamma,

666
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,690
equal to a constant

667
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,130
is a specific
case of one of

668
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,210
these polytropic
processes where we have

669
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,730
PV to some N
equals a constant,

670
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,809
in this case, the N is
equal to Gamma, okay?

671
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:41,569
This Gamma, we sometimes

672
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,489
give it a name.
We call this the.

673
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:48,449
Anyone know? If you
had to give it a name,

674
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:50,289
what would you call
it as the first word?

675
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:52,049
A constant.

676
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,930
Say it again. A constant.

677
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,089
An A constant? Okay.

678
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:56,689
We're creative
in here today.

679
00:28:56,689 --> 00:29:03,289
Other names? Adiabatic
adiabatic index, okay?

680
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,009
Yes. Okay? And actually,

681
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:08,129
this CV plus R is then

682
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:10,929
actually the
specific heat,

683
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,329
okay, at constant
pressure.

684
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:13,369
We'll get into
it in a second.

685
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,889
But this Gamma, you
can look up and

686
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,449
see because the world's a

687
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,609
confusing place, you know?

688
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:22,050
In some textbooks,
this gamma

689
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,209
will actually be
written as Kappa, okay?

690
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:27,930
Sorry. But, like, if
you look in the book,

691
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,570
I'm pretty sure it's
Gamma as a as a value.

692
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,289
I wish they had

693
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:32,809
more letters in their
alphabet, okay?

694
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:34,330
It's a beautiful language.

695
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,849
All right. All right.

696
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:40,374
Any questions about
that? Yes, please.

697
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:42,219
What did we do?

698
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:44,019
What did we just do?

699
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:47,539
You basically came up
with an expression for

700
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,339
a work transfer process

701
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:52,139
where you have no
heat in or out, okay?

702
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,300
And what I'm
telling you is

703
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,259
that there are

704
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,180
systems where
that's important,

705
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,619
where it's important
that I know

706
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,659
a state and I
expand it without

707
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,100
having any heat in or

708
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,419
out, and it produces work.

709
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:06,259
And this will help you
to string together

710
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:08,655
points when you
analyze cycles later.

711
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:10,969
So knowing if I have
an expansion process

712
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:12,930
that's at constant
pressure,

713
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,049
knowing that I have
a expansion process

714
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:16,530
at constant temperature,

715
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,409
and knowing that I have

716
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:18,609
an expansion process with

717
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,169
no heat in or out, these
are kind of three,

718
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:23,449
I want to call
them, almost

719
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,930
axiomatic in

720
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,070
analysis of work
transfer processes.

721
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,769
Okay.

722
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,209
I mean, no, because
you can watch

723
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,809
your video. So
three, right?

724
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,210
You have constant
pressure,

725
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,690
constant temperature,
no heat addition.

726
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,289
Got it. And in
all of them,

727
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:44,010
you have work transfer

728
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,049
through a boundary
moving, okay?

729
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:48,570
Yes, please.
Depending on which

730
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,049
process that equation for

731
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,729
every single one of them.

732
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,250
I mean, it depends
on the process.

733
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,089
You got to say, like,

734
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:56,449
what it is,
isothermal, right?

735
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,610
So isobaric N is zero,

736
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,889
isothermal N is one,

737
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:04,050
adiabatic, it's
equal to Gamma,

738
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,850
which in the case of
air, I think is 1.4.

739
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,844
Yes, please. On this side?

740
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:09,560
This side's got it.

741
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,039
It's like the right
side of my brain.

742
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,979
Okay, cool. Alright. Good.

743
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:19,019
Okay. So here's what

744
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,099
I want to do
now that I put

745
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:22,579
you all to sleep in
that is analyze.

746
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,859
So here you have a case of

747
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:26,299
PV with three
different processes,

748
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:29,259
A, B, C, and three
different work processes.

749
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:30,779
So the first question
that I have for you

750
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,739
is which one
transfers more work?

751
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:33,859
If everything is done in

752
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,780
quasi equilibrium
and isothermal,

753
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,139
which one of
these corresponds

754
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:38,140
to an ideal gas?

755
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,980
And three and
most importantly,

756
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,940
can you, for an
isothermal process,

757
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,499
tell me how much
work is done, okay?

758
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:45,940
And to remind
you on the quiz,

759
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,499
we're going to do some
stuff with adiabatic.

760
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:49,379
This is an isothermal
variant, okay?

761
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:51,274
Let me launch this.

762
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,610
Right, so an
expansion process

763
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,929
like that might
look like this,

764
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:56,649
let's say, V one
to V two, right?

765
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,490
So we start at the
high pressure,

766
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,689
and we go to a
lower one, right?

767
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:04,089
Okay, so that's with work.

768
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,470
And those videos
that I showed you,

769
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,669
like the
reciprocating, right?

770
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:10,989
So the pistons expand,

771
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:11,669
but we basically got

772
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:13,269
to bring them back, okay?

773
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:15,670
And if we want to
get work out of

774
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,670
that kind of a cycle,

775
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,549
right, we need
to basically

776
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:20,989
return to the
initial state, okay?

777
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,070
So what I'm showing you

778
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,550
here is a process where,

779
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,109
right, I have an
expansion of work,

780
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,549
V one to V two,
right, which is,

781
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,030
you know, kind
of like what we

782
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,749
computed in
this case here.

783
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,549
I have V two to V three,

784
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:34,959
where I, um, You know,

785
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,799
I have an isochoric
process where

786
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,200
I reduce the pressure.

787
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,479
Maybe I'm cooling, right?

788
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,799
Maybe I'm cooling
isochorically there,

789
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,479
and then I
compress, right?

790
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,440
Then basically I compress.

791
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,239
I go up to V four,

792
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:49,880
and then at
constant volume,

793
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,040
I increase the pressure.

794
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,329
Maybe I'm adding heat
isochorically, okay?

795
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:56,340
The most of the internal

796
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,700
combustion engines
you see on

797
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,619
the road and like

798
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,459
that basically run on
that process, right?

799
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:04,259
Iochoric key
addition, okay,

800
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,460
you know, with that.

801
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,420
So anyways, the
take home message

802
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,100
out of this is that

803
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,179
that still takes
work, right?

804
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:11,939
So go from V
three to V four,

805
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:14,459
I need to transfer
work in, okay?

806
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,980
And I have to
pay for that.

807
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,380
So if you do a cycle,

808
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,060
the network you
would get out of

809
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,739
it is the area under
the curve from

810
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:21,859
V one to V two

811
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:24,179
minus the area under
the curve from the

812
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,859
V three or state three
to state four there.

813
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:29,419
So the shaded
green area has

814
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,169
actually done the
net work, okay?

815
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:32,449
And we're going to use
that a lot, right?

816
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:33,890
We're going to give
you these cycles,

817
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,730
engines and Brighton and

818
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,249
beautiful stuff for arrow.

819
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,810
It's the area then
between these curves,

820
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,729
which is then going to
be the network out,

821
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,249
okay? Good. What else?

822
00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:47,609
So if I told you that

823
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:51,649
the shaded green area
is the network out,

824
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:54,329
what else do you think
the shaded green area

825
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:58,159
is in a in a
cycle like this?

826
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,109
The net heat in, right?

827
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:01,630
Because ultimately,
you need to end

828
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,589
up at your original
state, okay?

829
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:05,509
And from the
first law, right?

830
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,709
We have the Delta
U, right is,

831
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:09,629
you know, all the
work in the heat in

832
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,309
minus all the work
in the heat out.

833
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:14,029
So to get back to
the original state,

834
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:15,109
I can't have
any difference

835
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:15,989
in the energy, right?

836
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,469
I want to go back to
the initial state.

837
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,789
So whatever I take out of

838
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:20,149
that control
volume, right,

839
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:21,029
let's say in work,

840
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:22,429
network transferred
out has to

841
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,469
be equal to the net heat

842
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,949
transferred in, okay?

843
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,749
Think about that
over the weekend

844
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:28,469
since you all
gave me homework.

845
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,904
Okay. Are there any
questions about that?

846
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,700
Okay, if not, I am
2 minutes early,

847
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,100
so enjoy your beautiful

848
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,499
enjoy your
beautiful weekend.

849
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:39,819
And I'm up here if
you have questions.
