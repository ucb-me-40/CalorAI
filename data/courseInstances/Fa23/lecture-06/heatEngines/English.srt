1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,450
PROFESSOR: I'm also
quite curious what

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,992
this is going to look like on
the recorded video in the night

3
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:05,640
here.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,660
So now-- so all right.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,960
So that was-- we talked
about reservoirs.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,390
We talked about this single
expansion of a piston doing work

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,540
with an ideal gas there.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,162
That was not inconsistent
with Kelvin's statements

9
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:24,870
since we didn't just
have heat into work.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,265
We also had a change in the
volume from state 1 to state 2.

11
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:30,890
But now we're going
to start to connect

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,720
some of these more
thought experiments

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,283
with real concrete systems.

14
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:36,950
And the first type
that's very important

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,710
are what are called
heat engines.

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,870
So what is a heat engine?

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,440
So it's an engine which is here.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,810
We draw it as a ball.

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,325
I'll show a real example
in the next slide here.

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,660
But you have an engine here.

21
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,520
On one side of it, you have
a high temperature source.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,470
So that's a high temperature
source at some, let's say, TH.

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,610
And you have a low
temperature sink

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,450
which is at some temperature--

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,700
usually, it's denoted TL.

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,880
So you have some heat that
you're transferring in,

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,300
some work--

28
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,430
the net work that's
transferred out.

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,990
And in order to make this work,
to make this thing actually

30
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,218
work, you need to actually
transfer heat out of the system.

31
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:33,760
So just like I said before, we
thought about this experiment.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,000
We transfer heat in.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,768
You get some work.

34
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:38,060
But if you want to keep doing
that over and over again,

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,852
you're going to have
to have a cooling step

36
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:43,040
to bring it back to its
initial state to start over.

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,240
It's not intuitive.

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,290
I understand that.

39
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,770
I've had my PhD
students also ask

40
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,020
me, Tom, why don't we do this?

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,800
We can just put heat in.

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,840
Yeah, of course, fine.

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
But also, you have
to take heat out.

44
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,030
So you have that.

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,830
So you have the heat in, the
heat out, and the work out.

46
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,580
So it receives this heat from
a high temperature source.

47
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,040
It's converting it usually
into something like shaft work.

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,653
So this is like a model
for a power plant.

49
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:11,570
So that thing that you're
spinning is a shaft.

50
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,425
That shaft is connected
to a generator.

51
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,800
That generator
makes electricity.

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,370
And that's why we have
lights on in this room--

53
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,300
well, some lights
on in this room.

54
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,770
[CHUCKLES]

55
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,570
And then you got to reject
the remaining amount of heat.

56
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,860
Where do we reject that to?

57
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,930
We reject it to the environment.

58
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,940
So that-- I don't know--

59
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,840
I don't know--

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,038
I don't recall in
California seeing it a lot.

61
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:35,080
I grew up in the Midwest.

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,990
I grew up in Illinois.

63
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,280
Illinois was known for, among
other things, the Manhattan

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,820
Project.

65
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,520
We did nuclear.

66
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,800
Of course, they did a
lot of that stuff here.

67
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,020
But there's a lot of
nuclear power plants.

68
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,880
So we had a lot of
these cooling towers,

69
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,380
so these big gray things
where sometimes it

70
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,380
looks like a bunch of
smoke is coming out of it.

71
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,400
That's not smoke.

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,930
That's water vapor that's
condensed into droplets,

73
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,720
and it's clouds.

74
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,345
And that's where
you're rejecting heat.

75
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,350
You can also reject
heat into rivers.

76
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,200
It can be done into oceans.

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,740
And all of that is used to
cool steam that's coming out

78
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,670
of the back end of a turbine.

79
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,830
And again, these things
all operate on a cycle.

80
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,990
That's the key insight.

81
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,620
So what does it look like?

82
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,400
So again, the-- for now--

83
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,830
we're in a transition
to more sustainability

84
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,460
and weaning ourselves off of it.

85
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,340
But the reality, even in
where I was in Europe,

86
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,160
50% of all electricity there
was still generated in 2017

87
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,150
with a coal-fired power plant,
which looks exactly like this.

88
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,640
You take water.

89
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,520
You compress it with
a pump that goes

90
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,910
into what's called a boiler.

91
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,750
You take something.

92
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,590
It can be sunlight, it can
be coal, it can be whatever.

93
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,960
You burn it, or you
concentrate that heat.

94
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,260
You boil the water,
so that water

95
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,910
gets to a really high
temperature and a high pressure.

96
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,940
So you vaporize it, get
it to high temperature

97
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,910
and high pressure.

98
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,410
You send that into a turbine.

99
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,350
So first, it goes into
this really narrow part.

100
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,920
And then, as it passes through,
it causes these fans to spin.

101
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,920
It expands, transfers
work out to the generator.

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:18,430
Now you have, out of the back
end of there, still steam,

103
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,250
usually at a lower pressure
and maybe a lower temperature.

104
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,565
And then you condense that.

105
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:25,940
You condense that into what's
called a surface condenser.

106
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,100
So imagine this is
like a bunch of pipes.

107
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,400
So you have like 1,000 pipes
all next to each other.

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,710
On the inside of them, you
take water out of a river.

109
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,360
You send it through the pipe.

110
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,860
Then you put it back into
the river or into it.

111
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,730
On the outside of
those pipes, you

112
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,700
condense the steam
which is coming out

113
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,990
of the back end of that turbine.

114
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,720
So then your liquid here is
a liquid, saturated liquid,

115
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,090
and then you send it
back into the pump there.

116
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,480
Maybe it's interesting to know
that process of actually cooling

117
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,506
that condenser.

118
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,890
Does anyone want to hazard a
guess how much water we take out

119
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,450
of the ground every
year, as a percentage

120
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,450
of all the water that we
take out of the ground,

121
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,680
to actually cool surface
condensers in the US?

122
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,910
STUDENT: 60%.

123
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,870
PROFESSOR: Say it
[INDISCERNIBLE] one more time.

124
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,530
STUDENT: 60.

125
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,256
PROFESSOR: 60.

126
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:28,420
STUDENT: Someone said 20.

127
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,660
PROFESSOR: Someone said 20.

128
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,660
So if we took the average
of it, it's not far off.

129
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,280
50% of all the
flipping groundwater

130
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,490
we take out in a year
goes through something

131
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,310
that looks like this and
basically back into the ground.

132
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,322
At the end of It,
that's not consumption.

133
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:46,780
It's out of the ground, and
then it's back into the ground.

134
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,100
That's fine.

135
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,010
70% of all the water
that we consume in a year

136
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,450
actually goes into agriculture.

137
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,380
California feeds the world,
so a lot of [INDISCERNIBLE].

138
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,630
But it's interesting to know
because these things come

139
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,450
into conflict.

140
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,820
This is called the
water-energy nexus.

141
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,780
So we have energy.

142
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,050
Who needs water at some point?

143
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,920
We have water which
we need for drinking.

144
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,930
Sometimes it's called
water-energy-food nexus.

145
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,480
But all these things
come together.

146
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,980
And really, it's that device.

147
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,360
It's the surface condenser.

148
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,168
And yeah, that's literally
my entire line of research,

149
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,460
is looking at doing this
stuff, understanding it better

150
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,340
and how we do it
more efficiently.

151
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,800
Anyway, so we have
these four components.

152
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,740
Within this control volume-- so
if I'm not talking about river

153
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,240
water coming in and
cooling the condenser,

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,210
if I'm not talking about how
the fuel comes into heat--

155
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,050
I just have heat in.

156
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,800
I have heat out.

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,170
I have work in
for my compressor.

158
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,870
I have work out for my turbine.

159
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,200
We can treat that
as a closed system.

160
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,040
Because at this scale,
that water is not leaving,

161
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,920
assuming no leaks, whatever.

162
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,913
And closed systems
undergoing a cycle--

163
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:54,080
remember, we started in one
state, another, another,

164
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,720
another.

165
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,570
Just like being on
a track, you need

166
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,670
to get back where you
started at the beginning.

167
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,870
So with the first
law, then we have--

168
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:11,090
we'll have no change,
then, in that cycle.

169
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,520
So what you have to say
is that the work out

170
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,960
is equal to the heat in
minus, then, the heat out.

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,950
And so-- again, the point
is that this heat out-- we

172
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,650
need to do it.

173
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,940
You need to transfer it out.

174
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,330
And it represents a wasted heat,
but we would love to use it.

175
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,940
But it's just not at that high
temperature like we had before.

176
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,610
So you're getting an insight
that energy also has a quality.

177
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,380
It's not just conserved,
but it also has a quality.

178
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,060
And it's also never zero.

179
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,610
So the point is that the net
work that we can transfer out

180
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,330
is always less than the
heat that we transfer in.

181
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,710
And with these
terms now defined,

182
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,450
we can talk about
actual efficiency.

183
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,370
We can talk about an
actual, honest to God,

184
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,520
proper efficiency,
which is here--

185
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,470
and we write with
the Greek letter eta,

186
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,520
eta, which is the ratio
of the network output,

187
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,510
so the shaft work here, divided
by the total heat input.

188
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,100
So that's W net out
divided by Q in.

189
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,800
So we can rewrite that
diagram that I showed before.

190
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,080
So again, now we have that
high temperature reservoir

191
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,490
at a temperature TH.

192
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,590
So that-- the point
of the reservoir

193
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,940
is that TH won't change even
if I transfer heat out of it.

194
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,360
We have-- and we call
the heat transfer QH.

195
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,130
We then have the heat
rejected, so that's

196
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,419
QL, rejected to the low
temperature reservoir at TL.

197
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,750
And then we have
the W net out here.

198
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,570
Because I'm drawing
arrows, so because I'm

199
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,260
indicating arrows and directions
of where things are going,

200
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,960
we are treating these
things as magnitudes.

201
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,500
A vector is something that
has magnitude and direction.

202
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,120
I've given you the direction.

203
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,250
So these are just--

204
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,600
again, these are not vectors.

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,140
But in an analogy
with a vector, you

206
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,030
have a magnitude and direction.

207
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,697
I'm giving you the direction of
heat transfer and work transfer,

208
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:11,900
so these quantities are
treated as positive.

209
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,820
So rewriting it,
W net out is then

210
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,610
the Q from the high
temperature minus the Q

211
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,190
from the low
temperature reservoir.

212
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:28,010
And if we divide
both sides by QH--

213
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,720
the definition of eta was the
work out divided by the heat in,

214
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,460
so that's there.

215
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,850
And that's equal to 1 minus the
heat transferred to the lower

216
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,980
reservoir divided by
the heat transferred

217
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,660
from the high
temperature reservoir.

218
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,920
And some actual values--

219
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,120
so after like 120 years of
research into the diesel

220
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,670
engine-- that was one of the
first rationally designed

221
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,580
engines--

222
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,940
those things are close
to 40% efficiency,

223
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,020
so that's like
chemical-- basically,

224
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,680
your chemical energy,
in that sense,

225
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,910
is kind of like
your energy input,

226
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,985
and you have the work output.

227
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:15,980
The normal automobile
engine, close to 25%.

228
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,570
And these large, really
large steam power plants,

229
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,490
because they are really
highly optimized,

230
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,340
they can get up to 60% But the
take-home message from that

231
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,130
is like, 100 and
whatever years and lots

232
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,080
of money and investment,
and that's your number.

233
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,120
So you still lose
like 40% of this,

234
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,155
and that's necessary in
order to do the cycle.

235
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:43,030
To be able to do the
cycle and to keep going.

236
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,940
It's a necessary evil there.

237
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,080
And it may be interesting
to think about, there,

238
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,330
what was actually the first
steam engines looked like.

239
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,090
So if you want to think about
what engineering progress looked

240
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,840
like, you can look up
what that value was,

241
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,370
and maybe that helps you to
appreciate what 60 actually

242
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,500
looks like.

243
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,490
So making that more
concrete-- so again,

244
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,910
here, you can't run these
cycles without heat rejection,

245
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,030
so you've got a reservoir at
100 degrees C. Transfer it in.

246
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,990
You do some PV work out.

247
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,700
You have to bring that back
down to the initial stage.

248
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,080
In order to do that, you
have to transfer some heat

249
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,880
to the reservoir.

250
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,570
And again, that's boundary work.

251
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,090
But it's straightforward to
imagine if that was a shaft work

252
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,000
example too.

253
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,670
Coming back to sort of
an environmental context

254
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,010
of where we reject all
this heat to-- so this

255
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,520
is what's called
a sankey diagram.

256
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,590
So this is a diagram where--

257
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,230
they're really weird to read,
but they're left to right.

258
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:54,520
So you go left to right,
and the width of that stream

259
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,780
there indicates
more of something.

260
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,730
So here, you have, left
to right, fresh water

261
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,720
at the source, so that
could be groundwater,

262
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,220
river water, whatever.

263
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,810
And you have salt
water at the source,

264
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,340
so that can be like
the ocean, the sea.

265
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,090
And then you can
look where it goes.

266
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,900
So this comes out.

267
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,410
Most of it goes to some user.

268
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:23,390
Quite a lot of it is heading
towards the agricultural sector,

269
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,292
the public.

270
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:25,750
But you see here,
the number that's

271
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,620
even bigger than the than
the agricultural consumption

272
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,490
is that the majority
of the water

273
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,290
is passing through a
thermoelectric power plant,

274
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,780
so that means like
steam power plant,

275
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,490
like the things that you see.

276
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,790
And of course, we're not
consuming that, in a sense.

277
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,510
You take it, it passes
through the surface condenser,

278
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,090
and then it goes
back into the ground

279
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,670
or into the river, where
then perhaps it might

280
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,370
be used in agriculture.

281
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,160
So that's the
discharge part of it.

282
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,660
And then here in
agriculture, that's

283
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,270
actually consumed
because plants undergo

284
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,800
what's called transpiration.

285
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,140
They lose water vapor.

286
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:11,620
They evaporate it or use
it in growth as well.

287
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,940
But that part about
the discharge--

288
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,300
that water is no longer
at the same temperature

289
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,240
that it came in with.

290
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,105
So that water is warmer.

291
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:20,980
You're putting that back
into an environment,

292
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,580
and that also has consequences.

293
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,730
So if you start to
heat up river water--

294
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,700
just being-- for
us at home, it's

295
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,640
not as pleasant to probably
stay in an environment that's

296
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:39,180
too warm, and these things can
have damage and impact from it.

297
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,000
And it's not at some tiny scale.

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,200
It's at a scale of all of our
water that we use, or most of it

299
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,760
is at some point doing
something like that.

300
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,010
I hope you're sufficiently
motivated about steam power

301
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,650
plants in the dark here.

302
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:00,650
So then other-- so other systems
where we look at this analysis

303
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,380
with the reservoir there for
what's called refrigerators

304
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,860
and heat pumps, the
latter of which is how--

305
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,310
the current US plan
for decarbonizing

306
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,520
our heating-- residential and
commercial heating sectors

307
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,020
is this.

308
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,930
You take-- in a nutshell,
you take electricity.

309
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,870
You run a compressor or a pump.

310
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,990
You take some fluid.

311
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,520
It's called a refrigerant.

312
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,170
You bring it to a high pressure
and a high temperature.

313
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,060
You reject that heat.

314
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,630
So you reject that-- or
you transfer heat there

315
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,370
at that high temperature
into some surroundings.

316
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,210
If it's in your--

317
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,290
you have what are called--

318
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,430
what are they called?

319
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,700
Air heat pumps,
[INDISCERNIBLE] air heat pumps,

320
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,240
where you're more
or less rejecting,

321
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,413
let's say, heat into
the environment.

322
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:56,080
Then we go through
that expansion valve.

323
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,038
Remember that throttling
valve I talked before,

324
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,370
where we have a sudden
expansion, and then,

325
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,750
therefore, trading off PV
for an internal energy.

326
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,570
So this gets really cold, and
then you can cool some process.

327
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,410
That's how it looks like in
an air conditioning system.

328
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,715
That's more or less how
your refrigerator is.

329
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:14,840
So that would be your home.

330
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,010
That would be the outside.

331
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,260
What's interesting about
these systems for, let's say,

332
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,390
using them is when we
use them in reverse.

333
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,510
So if you run them in reverse,
you can actually take--

334
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,182
you can transfer heat, let's
say from a cold outside--

335
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,390
this is going to sound weird.

336
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,380
But you can transfer
heat from the outside

337
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,390
when it's cold into the
inside of your home.

338
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,390
And what's really
cool about this

339
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,800
is that when you're
transferring heat like that,

340
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,330
1 unit of electricity
consumed here in work

341
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,860
might equal 3 units of heat
transferred from the environment

342
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,310
into your home, and vice versa.

343
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,520
And that's really key.

344
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,510
That tells you exactly why you
would not do Joule heating,

345
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,420
like a resistor.

346
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,880
So if I had electricity
and I had a Joule resistor,

347
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,360
I could heat the air in
my home or the water.

348
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
That makes sense, right?

349
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,860
That makes sense,
and I would do it.

350
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,010
But this is a way where
you can take energy that--

351
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,830
you can take and
transfer thermal energy

352
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,800
from the environment outside
and get more bang for your buck.

353
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,820
And the bang is like a
factor 3, so this isn't

354
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,640
like some 60% thing, 45% thing.

355
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,173
This is like-- we're talking
factors of difference there.

356
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:30,590
And we'll go more
into that there.

357
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,330
But again, you sort of set up
the problem in the same way.

358
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,850
You have some
thermal reservoirs.

359
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,500
You treat this, then, a
as a closed system there,

360
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
and we do some analysis.

361
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,700
And there, we won't
talk about efficiency,

362
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,430
because efficiency of 300%
doesn't make any sense.

363
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,420
We call that coefficient
of performance.

364
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,450
Bringing it home, here, I'm just
going to give you some examples.

365
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,450
So the other thing about
the second law-- again,

366
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,700
about this temperature
differences that we were saying

367
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,060
about the tendency
of things to flow--

368
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,848
so again, this is this
video with the balloons.

369
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,890
So you have something at
high pressure and there,

370
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,319
and you release it, and it--

371
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,902
they move.

372
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,819
Believe it or not, this
video was made at MIT.

373
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,480
I find it hilarious
that an MIT professor

374
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,280
is making videos like that.

375
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,980
So great.

376
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,010
And they're nice videos.

377
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,817
You can learn a lot from
this-- from these links there.

378
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:22,400
This is that food dye example,
for those of you who have never

379
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,140
played with food coloring.

380
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,150
I do this on the regular.

381
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,420
So you put it in there, and then
you can watch it diffuse there.

382
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,260
And then there's the thermal
example where here, they

383
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,150
take a pan, they
put a really cool--

384
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,080
it's called thermochromic
liquid crystals.

385
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,130
These are things that change
color depending on the heat.

386
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,460
So you see here it's really hot.

387
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,620
And then you put it out
and you let it cool,

388
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,700
and you see it change
color, and you transfer.

389
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,588
So again, talking about things
that happen spontaneously--

390
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,130
so if it's something
that can happen,

391
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,730
it's something that's going
to be following the first

392
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,550
and the second laws
of thermodynamics.
