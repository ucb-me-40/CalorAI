1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
PROFESSOR: Okay so first
law, let's talk about this

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,630
before we dive into
the second law.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,640
So what we found from
the first law was

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,390
it was impossible to make a
machine that could make energy

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,760
right, that could generate--

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,407
that could basically
create energy.

7
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:16,740
We talked about transformations.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,650
We said we can't have a machine
that just creates energy.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,460
Energy always is.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,110
It just goes through
transformations.

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,340
The thing about the
first law, though,

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,400
is it doesn't put any
constraints on this energy

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,870
transformation from
one end to the other.

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,560
So this example that
I give you here, let's

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,510
say this experiment
that Joule did, right.

16
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,970
Joule took a paddle, and he
spun this paddle in water.

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,790
That paddle hit the water,
caused the water to move.

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,020
That water then dissipated
this energy viscously.

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,050
It became heat.

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,510
And then he was measuring that
with a with a thermometer.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,680
We thought, okay, we
could do that in reverse.

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,203
Why don't I just take the heat,
pump it or transfer it into the

23
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:05,495
into the water, and it should
cause the paddle to spin.

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,100
Does that work?

25
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,360
Based on your experience?

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,490
Hell no, right.

27
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,720
So that does not work.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,840
So that does not work.

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,830
And the second law is we
need another law then.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,280
So because the first law doesn't
put any stop sign for that.

31
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,320
Exactly.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,840
So as we know, so as we know
from this fact of this example

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,720
here with the paddle
or from the example of,

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,947
let's say I have
a resistor, right.

35
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:47,280
I pass electricity through that.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,960
It makes heat.

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,980
If I transfer heat
into that resistor,

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,600
I do not get
electricity out of it.

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
So we know from
experience there are

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,810
definite limitations into
the transformation of heat

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,820
into work.

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
And that is what
motivated, right,

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,320
the development of the second
laws to explain that and then,

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,536
ultimately, use it
for developments.

45
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,770
And so for a long time, people
tried to do this stuff, though.

46
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,250
People tried to make
these machines that could

47
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,520
create energy on their own.

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,970
If you were able to do what I
just described before, you'd

49
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,690
be able to take a
machine, literally

50
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,540
extract heat out of the
surroundings, cooling it,

51
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,263
and then directly
creating it into work

52
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,930
because we're on earth here, and
we have heat everywhere, right?

53
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,130
So there's thermal energy
contained in here, in the soil,

54
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,370
and the atmosphere.

55
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,340
You have, like, an
unlimited reservoir of heat.

56
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,720
It is also the challenge
of our entire lives, right,

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,593
is the fact that we
have too much of it.

58
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:55,260
And so what you would end up if
you were to create such a device

59
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,900
is you could design
something that

60
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,750
would do what's called
perpetual motion

61
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,460
or perpetuum mobile, all right.

62
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,990
So it's a perpetual
motion machine.

63
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,410
And people like devoted a
lot of their times and lives,

64
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,690
like, the alchemists trying
to make gold from what lead

65
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,990
or whatever it was.

66
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,920
They were the equivalent
of the alchemists

67
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,520
in thermodynamics who were
working on perpetual motion.

68
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,062
And the second law firmly
rules these out, okay.

69
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:24,895
So if you're an engineer
and you come across

70
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:27,353
and someone sends you some
email, it gives you a phone call

71
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:33,470
and says I got this great
thing, you only pay,

72
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,520
10 kilojoules of energy
of this and you're

73
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,983
going to get like
20 kilojoules out,

74
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:40,400
you're going to,
first of all say,

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,700
hey, that's like a violation
of the first law, okay.

76
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,200
And the second thing
is you're going

77
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,130
to say it definitely also
violates the second law

78
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,180
there as well.

79
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,220
So you use this to sniff out
interphrase bullshit, right?

80
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,620
You're going to use this as
your BS meter there, right.

81
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,530
All right.

82
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,580
And this was the cover of
Popular Magazine in apparently

83
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,408
in the 1920s there.

84
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:10,700
So like I said, a lot of
people worked for a long time.

85
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,250
They tried to do it.

86
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,630
They don't work.

87
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,000
But if you do make
one and they do work,

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,240
you will get filthy rich.

89
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,269
But again, I don't
necessarily advise

90
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,870
investing your life in that.

91
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,670
Another key concept when we're
talking about the second law

92
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,280
and understanding
it and what it means

93
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,070
is to talk about what's called
the thermal energy reservoir.

94
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,150
In a nutshell, it's
something that's

95
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,040
big, okay, with respect to the
thing that's transferring heat

96
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,580
to and from it.

97
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,070
Examples sort of
in everyday life

98
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,970
would be something
like an ocean.

99
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,193
So if you do atmospheric
modeling or simulations,

100
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,610
let's say you're
transferring heat

101
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,340
maybe over the course
of a day, maybe

102
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,160
from that into the into the
ocean or maybe it's you,

103
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,940
you're by there and transferring
some heat to and from it,

104
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,690
the temperature of the
body doesn't really

105
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,000
change because you are--

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,013
well, whatever.

107
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:10,430
The thing transferring
is probably

108
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,320
very small with
respect to the ocean

109
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,870
because that's a
very big entity.

110
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,010
And that's the point.

111
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,060
You transfer energy
to or from it,

112
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,293
but the temperature of the
reservoir doesn't change.

113
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,580
We'll get to why we need
that in a in a second.

114
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,560
Okay, so as I said, a lot of--

115
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,720
well, the first lot
and the second law,

116
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,520
a lot of these things,
we did experiments.

117
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,550
We observed what
happens, and we try

118
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,120
to come up with
rules that are trying

119
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,400
to rationalize what we observe.

120
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,110
In thermal. we call
those postulates.

121
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,550
You postulate this.

122
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,733
So the first law was a postulate
on the conservation of energy,

123
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,400
and that is like
pretty straightforward.

124
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,470
That's like accounting.

125
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,970
That's like accounting.

126
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,670
The second law is not exactly
as straightforward as that.

127
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,860
So I'm going to give you two
statements about the second law.

128
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
I'll read them.

129
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,210
I'll read them kind of slowly.

130
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,570
So the first one is from
Lord Kelvin, so again,

131
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,260
a very famous, famous physicist.

132
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,540
So a transformation
whose only final result

133
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,140
is to transform into work--

134
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,770
dramatic effect-- heat
extracted from a source,

135
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,672
which is at the same temperature
throughout is impossible.

136
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:35,880
All right, you're going to
read that, and you'll say,

137
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,088
what the heck does that mean?

138
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,900
We're going to do an example
in a second to make it firm.

139
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,875
But the thing is that
the key words here--

140
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,500
first key word I want
to point out here

141
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,960
is only final result. So
the only final result of,

142
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,660
let's say, this
transformation is

143
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,140
you're taking this heat from
some source, so a single source

144
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,000
temperature uniform throughout
at the same temperature,

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,990
and you're going to convert
this directly into--

146
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,420
directly into heat.

147
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,030
So keep this in mind.

148
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,630
This also doesn't come from me.

149
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,333
I have to like think
about this a lot.

150
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,000
Like I think about this so much
that sometimes I dream about it,

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,030
and then it freaks my wife
out, all right, and yeah,

152
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,610
because it's deep stuff.

153
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,360
And the evidence to
support this statement

154
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,693
is people have tried to do this.

155
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:24,200
So as I said before,
with this example

156
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,900
of the of Joule's machine
of the heat into--

157
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,400
directly into, let's
say, the paddle

158
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,890
and trying to get
work directly out.

159
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,740
It doesn't work.

160
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,230
There's a lot of other-- if
you can go on to Wikipedia,

161
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,220
it's amazing how many devices
that they've tried to construct.

162
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,090
And when a device, let's
say, satisfies the first law,

163
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,450
as I said, energy
conservation but does not

164
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,750
satisfy this statement,
we call that a perpetuum

165
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,350
mobile of the second kind.

166
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,330
So second means the second law.

167
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,050
If something wasn't-- was a
machine that violated the first

168
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,390
law, we'd would call it
perpetuum mobile of the first

169
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,475
kind.

170
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,600
I'll give you a second
statement on the second law.

171
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,280
So the second statement
is a transformation

172
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,340
whose only final result is
to transfer heat from a body

173
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,560
at a given temperature
to a body at a higher

174
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,630
temperature is impossible.

175
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,990
This you already did.

176
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,110
Who was here for
that experiment?

177
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,330
We did molecular dynamics
simulations in class,

178
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,542
and we looked at the direction
that heat transferred.

179
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:23,500
You may have been here.

180
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,330
Maybe you don't remember it.

181
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,490
I've given you a
lot of information.

182
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,448
But you did look at it.

183
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:28,190
You had a reservoir
at one temperature.

184
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,482
You had another one at another.

185
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,090
You released the
barrier, and you

186
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,980
looked at how the
mean temperature

187
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,630
spatially was varying.

188
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,002
This is something that's
more intuitive to me.

189
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:39,460
So this statement
on the second law

190
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,880
is like things at high
temperature tend to spread,

191
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,710
right?

192
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,380
So I have a hot pan at home
that's really hot, okay.

193
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:54,760
I take it off the stove, and
I set it on an insulating mat

194
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,310
there.

195
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,160
And what will
happen is over time,

196
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,470
that thermal energy
will dissipate

197
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,290
to the environment, conduction,
convection, radiation, right.

198
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,370
It's going to go away.

199
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,460
So that's an example of
things tend to spread.

200
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,710
If you take a balloon, right--

201
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,860
I take a balloon, high
pressure, right, of gas in it.

202
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,020
I pop it.

203
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,050
That's enjoyable.

204
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,650
But what you have
there is that the gas

205
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,510
tends to expand, so
another example of it.

206
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,340
A third one, I mean, examples
are given here like perfume,

207
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,840
right?

208
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,800
So you put something here.

209
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,830
You spray a bit of it.

210
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,140
It tends to diffuse.

211
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,100
Food dye in water,
it tends to diffuse.

212
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,725
So this is something
where you probably

213
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:33,060
have preexisting
knowledge, right, of this.

214
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,280
And this is a postulate
from Rudolf Clausius.

215
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,230
So Rudolf Clausius was the first
chair of physics at ETH Zurich.

216
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,050
So that's where I was before.

217
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,350
My building that I was on
was called Clausius Strasse,

218
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,360
which means Clausius Street.

219
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,300
And yeah, he was there,
basically, in the 1850s,

220
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,150
and he took the work of Sadi
Carnot and put it like on a firm

221
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,730
basis.

222
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,810
So he took the work of Sadi,
which was already very good

223
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,590
but was using what was called
Caloric Theory of heat,

224
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:07,550
and Clausius put it on a
more, basically, firm basis.

225
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,890
There he has a very
interesting history.

226
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,480
And if you want to learn more
about it, you can read it there.

227
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,510
Okay, so you have some
preexisting experience

228
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,690
on this statement.

229
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,410
I've given you this
other statement there.

230
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,342
And here's what I'd like
to do now, all right.

231
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:25,800
So to, kind of,
make this concrete,

232
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,580
especially the first statement,
which is a bit less intuitive,

233
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,570
so I'm giving you this.

234
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,990
I'm giving you
Kelvin's statement.

235
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,220
I'm putting this term in bold
here, and this is the scenario.

236
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,360
So the scenario is you have
a thermal energy reservoir.

237
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,940
So remember, big thing at
some temperature, temperature

238
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,445
won't change if I transfer heat.

239
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:49,070
So I take that.

240
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,950
I transfer some heat into--

241
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,900
excuse me-- this piston.

242
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,905
So this piston here can expand
so that the piston rod can move.

243
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,720
So the substance that's
in there is an ideal gas.

244
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,340
The ideal gas is
expanding because of this.

245
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,080
And we assume that the
gas is then isothermal.

246
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,580
Why?

247
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,150
Because you have it in contact
with the energy reservoir,

248
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,870
all right.

249
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,570
So that's the prompt.

250
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,580
Just give me a second.

251
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,320
All right, and so
the first question

252
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,228
that you're going
to ask is that--

253
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,520
I want you to answer with this.

254
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,937
You can open it
up on your phones.

255
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,890
But the first question is, does
the internal energy of the gas

256
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,097
change during this process?

257
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,430
So if I take this thing, it's
at a constant temperature,

258
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,670
and I transfer heat.

259
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,310
Does the internal energy change
for this isothermal process?

260
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,040
The second one is using
the first law applied

261
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,920
to this control
volume, is the work

262
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,800
performed by the expanding
gas equal to the heat that it

263
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,440
absorbs?

264
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,670
So is the boundary
work, the PDV work

265
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,475
that happens here equal to
the heat that's transferred.

266
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,350
And then what I want
you to do with those two

267
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,900
pieces of information, which
hopefully are straightforward,

268
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,900
is answer is this
a contradiction

269
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,010
of the Kelvin postulate,
which is here, okay?
