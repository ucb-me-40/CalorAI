      "detailed_summary": "The section defines **specific heat ($c$)** as the fundamental property that quantifies the amount of heat energy ($Q$) required to raise the temperature ($\\Delta T$) of a unit mass ($m$) of a substance. It is the parameter that dictates the temperature response of a system to a given heat transfer. The concept is illustrated by comparing materials like iron and water: for the same amount of heat transferred, water's temperature rises minimally compared to iron's, demonstrating water's **high specific heat capacity** and its ability to store a large amount of energy. Specific heat is shown to be non-constant, varying based on the **nature of the substance** and the molecular **modes of energy storage**. The lecture notes that substances with more available molecular modes (e.g., rotational and vibrational modes) generally exhibit a higher specific heat. Finally, the lecture introduces two types of specific heat, which are especially relevant for gases, as the heat transferred depends on the process path: **Specific Heat at Constant Volume ($c_v$)** for isochoric processes (e.g., in an automobile engine) and **Specific Heat at Constant Pressure ($c_p$)**. The core mathematical relationship is given by $Q = m c \\Delta T$.",
