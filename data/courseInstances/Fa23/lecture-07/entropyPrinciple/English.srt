1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
PROFESSOR: Here's
what I want to do now.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,733
We're going to apply this.

3
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:07,050
So here is your Carnot cycle,
again, showing you here.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,140
So we have this
cyclical process, the A,

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,690
B, C, D, with the high
temperature being T1,

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,960
the low temperature being T2,
and the high entropy is S2,

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,350
and the low entropy as being S1.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,260
There's a series of questions
where you go through and answer

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,097
about what each of these sort
of steps are and formulas to do.

10
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:29,430
So I say take five minutes here.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,990
I have 10:34.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,825
So let's say at 10:40, we'll
come back together in plenary.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,200
Are there any questions about
this activity before we get

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,700
started?

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,245
Okay, let's go.

16
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:42,190
[LAUGHS]

17
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,370
Okay, so we look here.

18
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,160
So if we now start with A
to B, so the transformation.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,600
So the majority is in for
isothermal, the reason

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,270
being that here A to B is a
constant temperature process.

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:02,480
So that is by definition
isothermal there.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,450
If you have questions about the
adiabatic, we can discuss it.

23
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,492
But that's going to be,
I think, taken home here.

24
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:10,360
So in the in the B
to C, so with this

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,007
we have a process that's
isentropic, right?

26
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,340
So there's no change in entropy.

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,450
Entropy is constant.

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,080
Due to this relation between
the entropy and the heat,

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,320
you can infer from
that that that's also

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,690
an adiabatic process.

31
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,260
So there will be no heat
transfer that happens to here.

32
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,530
Isochoric is constant volume.

33
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,500
Isobaric is constant pressure.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,425
C to D, again, it's the inverse
of A to B. So that's isothermal.

35
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:39,170
Remember constant temperature.

36
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,010
And D to A is again,
this is the link

37
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,760
between the entropy
and the heat transfer,

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,400
so that's an adiabatic process.

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,030
So these are like
heat in, heat out.

40
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,410
And then that's your various
work that's done on this system

41
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,070
or transferred out of it.

42
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,020
Okay, so what's the
change in entropy

43
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,443
during the
transformation to A to B?

44
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,110
So the first thing
to note is that we're

45
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,125
dealing with the reservoir
here at the at temperature 1.

46
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,000
And then this is going
to be heat transferred

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,630
into the system, right?

48
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,050
So we have S2 or SB
minus SA, so that's

49
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,470
going to be a positive
quantity here,

50
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:34,200
because that's bigger than that.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
And so that's at the
T1, so that's there.

52
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,670
And the Q1 is how we write it.

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,210
So of course, here you'd
have the right magnitude,

54
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,160
but you'd end up
having the wrong sign.

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,650
So if you calculated this
minus this, that's positive.

56
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,560
And so write the
integral of that DQ2

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,320
for the constant temperature
then should be Q1 divided by T1,

58
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,840
and not dealing with
the Q2s and T2s.

59
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,862
C to D or B to C, so
if we go from B to C,

60
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:09,070
what's the change in entropy?

61
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,050
So that's again,
what you said before,

62
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,850
isentropic, so very good.

63
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,720
So that should be a 0.

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,290
Continuing along, C to
D, so with C to D here,

65
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,378
now we're taking heat
out of the system.

66
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:24,670
So again, in the power plant,
this is like our cooling.

67
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,580
We're sending this
to the cooling tower.

68
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,660
And all of this, this
is the low grade heat.

69
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,510
So that's at the temperature 2.

70
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,180
So your reservoir
is at temperature 2,

71
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,240
isothermal, so you would
be able to integrate that.

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,850
It's reversible, so the DQ
just becomes Q. So that's

73
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,870
the Q2 divided by T2.

74
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,190
The key thing to note
is that the entropy

75
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,170
after this process
minus the entropy

76
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,620
before is going to be negative.

77
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,880
So the signage here, you have
to be consistent with it.

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,252
But this would be Q2--

79
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:55,710
according to the convention we
have, this would be minus Q2

80
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,990
divided by T2 there.

81
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,420
Okay?

82
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,840
All right.

83
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,400
So one may make
arguments for this,

84
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,650
but again, you have to be
consistent with your signage

85
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,900
from your previous answer.

86
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,940
Okay, and then from D to
A here, so this is again,

87
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,910
an isentropic process,
which is adiabatic.

88
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,900
So then that should be 0 there.

89
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,180
So what is the net change
in entropy in the cycle?

90
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,300
So for those who
have put this here,

91
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,960
whoever wrote out the
word "zero," why is it 0?

92
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:51,787
STUDENT: Just based
on stage, right,

93
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:55,625
just start that at the
same [INDISCERNIBLE] 0.

94
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,000
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's exactly--

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,770
that's well-stated, again,
better than I said it.

96
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,560
So hey, they even wrote it.

97
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,850
Great, that's it.

98
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:10,500
So that's the-- that's
the point of that

99
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,610
is that if you start then you
stop at the same point there,

100
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,440
then the entropy
will be the same.

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,900
Of course, when we're dealing
with heat transferred in

102
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,290
and heat transferred out, those
are not necessarily the same.

103
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,680
Actually, in this
case, it's not.

104
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
So the net heat
transfer in, which

105
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,090
would be the difference between
the area under the top curve

106
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,250
and the area under
the bottom curve, we'd

107
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,137
have a net heat transfer in.

108
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,220
For this closed volume as
we're dealing with here,

109
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,790
that's going to be
equal to the work out.

110
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,540
So if we just simply
focus on the entropy,

111
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,400
though, as a classmate
said, it's going to be 0.

112
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,180
All right?

113
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,555
We'll have more chances to
work through this and probably

114
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:56,020
nice problems to ask from
other students who proposed.

115
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,770
Okay, are there any questions
about that before we move on?

116
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,690
Yes, please.

117
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,780
STUDENT: Can you use like those
given equations to find Q1?

118
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,810
Is that a true statement?

119
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,400
Is Q1 over T1 minus Q2 and
T2 equal 0, or is that not?

120
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,020
PROFESSOR: I'm not
saying it's not wrong.

121
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,895
Let's think about it.

122
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:26,670
So here you have
a Q1, which is--

123
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,860
is this a big number or a small
number relative to Q2 or to TQ2?

124
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,360
Yeah?

125
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:39,160
STUDENT: [INDISCERNIBLE].

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,330
PROFESSOR: It's big, right?

127
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,580
What about T1?

128
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,848
Is T1 a big number or a
small number relative to T2?

129
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:44,390
STUDENT: Big.

130
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,710
Big.

131
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,627
PROFESSOR: Big, right?

132
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:47,710
So I've got a big number
divided by a big number.

133
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,460
And now I have Q2 divided by T2.

134
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,990
So what is Q2--

135
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,800
a big number or a
small number relative?

136
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,947
STUDENT: Bigger.

137
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:00,030
PROFESSOR: Smaller, right?

138
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,320
And what about T2?

139
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,280
STUDENT: Smaller.

140
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,072
PROFESSOR: Smaller.

141
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:05,610
So now I got a small number
divided by a small number.

142
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,940
So big divided by big minus
small divided by small,

143
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,040
it might follow that that
ends up being also 0.

144
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,790
So it's not wrong.

145
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,360
I didn't say that
was wrong, did I?

146
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,470
So but yeah, maybe
that's worthwhile.

147
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,210
Also an example in the
homework to give that.

148
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,640
Okay, other
questions about this?

149
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,390
Yes, please?

150
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,485
STUDENT: Is this the Carnot
cycle just rewritten?

151
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,158
[INDISCERNIBLE]

152
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:37,200
PROFESSOR: Wait a second.

153
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,845
This is temperature
and entropy, right?

154
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:39,170
STUDENT: Yeah.

155
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
Carnot-- last week,

156
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,350
did we do something
with-- we did something

157
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,225
with pressure, right?

158
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,810
We did do a plot
with the p-V yeah.

159
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,720
So this is a representation
of what I showed you

160
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,630
with those adiabatic
and isothermal processes

161
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,760
in the p-V diagram, now
represented on the TS diagram.

162
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,367
Yes?

163
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,200
And hopefully you see
the convenience of it,

164
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,490
because it's like a square.

165
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,115
And these are really
easy to integrate.

166
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:05,310
[LAUGHS] Other questions?

167
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:05,890
Yes, please?

168
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,390
Thomas.

169
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,502
STUDENT: Are TS plus
isomorphic [INDISCERNIBLE]?

170
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:09,585
PROFESSOR: Say that again.

171
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:11,710
STUDENT: Are TS plus
isomorphic to [INDISCERNIBLE]?

172
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,820
PROFESSOR: Isomorphic,
describe isomorphic to me.

173
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,480
STUDENT: The 1 to 1
mapping [INDISCERNIBLE].

174
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
PROFESSOR: I mean,
1 to 1 mapping,

175
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
there's formulas that can
draw you between them.

176
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,730
Topologically they
look the same, right?

177
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,360
So I'd have to think about it.

178
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
That's a good question,
though again, that's a--

179
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,800
yeah, maybe that's a
nasty question to ask.

180
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,300
So other questions?

181
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,800
All right.

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,633
Let's talk about it in
office hours, Thomas.

183
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,640
Exactly.

184
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,530
So now, again, as was explicitly
alluded to by the classmate,

185
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,520
so the heat absorbed
by the system--

186
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,290
so again, the shaded area
that would be within here

187
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,180
is the Q, which is
equal to Q1 minus Q2.

188
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,720
So heat transferred from
the high temperature

189
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,270
and heat transferred out by the
low temperature gives you the Q.

190
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,230
So since the work
done on one of these

191
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,530
closed volume cycles
is equal to the heat

192
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,470
in is equal to work out,
well, what we can write

193
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,440
is that that work is then equal
to the shaded area, right?

194
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,110
So that's going to be S2, S1.

195
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,970
So the rectangle, one
length is S2 minus S1,

196
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,610
the other length is T1 minus T2.

197
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,490
So that gives you
the work there.

198
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,680
If you recall, for the
isothermal process--

199
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,400
so remember, we integrated
that DQ divided by T,

200
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,502
so the T is isothermal.

201
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,210
So that doesn't change
with the integral.

202
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,380
The little d in
dQ can be written

203
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,320
as a definite differential.

204
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,390
So then we get Q1 is equal to T1
times the change in the entropy

205
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,885
from state 2 to state 1.

206
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,108
If we now take the
work transferred out

207
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,650
divided by the heat transferred
in from that high temperature

208
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,460
reservoir, this is
efficiency, okay?

209
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,070
Why?

210
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,010
Because that heat that we
put in is like the stuff

211
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,968
that we pay for, right?

212
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,080
At the moment you pay
for fuel that you burn,

213
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,430
that makes that heat, that
runs your power plant, that

214
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,945
makes your shaft work there.

215
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,070
So that's what you get out.

216
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,300
That's what you put in.

217
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,090
If we write that--

218
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:20,110
again, for this, if the heat
is transferred in isothermally,

219
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,940
then we can write that.

220
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,390
This cancels.

221
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,760
And so what you have
here is 1 minus the ratio

222
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,520
of the low temperature reservoir
divided by the high temperature

223
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,470
reservoir is the efficiency
of a Carnot cycle.

224
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,080
So what's weird
about this equation?

225
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,814
Okay.

226
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,290
STUDENT: [INDISCERNIBLE].

227
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,380
PROFESSOR: That's
excellent insight.

228
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,510
So if you have a high
temperature reservoir,

229
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,310
you will have a more
efficient system.

230
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,280
If you're low temperature
reservoir is colder,

231
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,950
you will also have a
more efficient system.

232
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,703
So on the absolute scale,
remember, on the absolute scale.

233
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:10,120
What's the other
thing that's kind

234
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,565
of weird about this equation?

235
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:17,765
Thomas?

236
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:19,680
STUDENT: It's only
temperature dependent.

237
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,315
PROFESSOR: Say that again.

238
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:21,000
STUDENT: It's only
temperature dependent.

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,792
PROFESSOR: It's only
temperature dependent.

240
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,540
I didn't say anything
about a fluid.

241
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,210
I didn't even say
really much about how

242
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,130
this system would work.

243
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,460
We did all of this math, like
there was all this complex stuff

244
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,240
on the board and
we got to there.

245
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,910
And then in the end,
that's your formula.

246
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:44,820
So in a Carnot cycle-- so again,
this idealized, reversible cycle

247
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,580
there, in the end, it's
only the temperature

248
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,750
of the reservoirs that
determine the efficiency

249
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,450
of the system, which is
also kind of interesting.

250
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,720
Okay.

251
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,950
So I'm not going to read it,
but this is Carnot's theorem.

252
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,200
So as we stated it, as
Thomas just said there,

253
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,043
so that's the theorem.

254
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:12,960
So it doesn't depend on
the working substance.

255
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,840
It's only dependent--
the efficiency

256
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,740
is only dependent on the
two operating temperatures.

257
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,420
And so with that, that's
these first two points.

258
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,600
What I'd like to do now
with the last six minutes

259
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,660
is to at least start giving
you the knowledge base

260
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,390
to answer the question
from your classmate there,

261
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,790
which is to establish the
increase of entropy principle.

262
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,030
So I'm just going to
give you a statement.

263
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,280
So things are more likely to
occur in an isolated system

264
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,120
if the change in
entropy there is 0,

265
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,812
or if the change is to increase?

266
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,270
So we talked about
taking these two

267
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,020
things at different
temperatures,

268
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,470
putting them
together to analyze.

269
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,520
Then if those things are going
to come to the same temperature,

270
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,180
the transformation, if that's
what we hypothesize to happen,

271
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,330
then this statement
would have to be true.

272
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,960
Okay?

273
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,490
And this inequality
holds, so not the equals.

274
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,010
The inequality holds if the
isolated system is not initially

275
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:14,653
at equilibrium.

276
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:16,570
So if it initially, like
in the example there,

277
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,528
we have two things with
different temperatures,

278
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:21,760
we suddenly bring them together,
they are not in equilibrium,

279
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,630
they will tend towards
equilibrium there.

280
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,300
So then the most
probable processes

281
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,950
that might occur in
an isolated system

282
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,730
are those in which the entropy
increases or remains constant.

283
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,720
I could derive this for you.

284
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,830
But for that, we need
statistical mechanics.

285
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,880
There's a great video on
MIT, Professor Lenhart,

286
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,210
who sort of goes into it.

287
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,210
I thought what might
be more instructive is

288
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,912
to come back to this
video that we had before.

289
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:54,120
So in the video we had
before, we did this experiment

290
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,912
with heat transfer.

291
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:57,270
We had one reservoir
with particles

292
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,520
at a lower temperature,
another one of them that

293
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,270
was at higher temperatures.

294
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,350
And we looked at the
direction that things moved.

295
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,080
All right.

296
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,650
So as a function of
time, what we had noticed

297
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,290
was that the things that were
at the higher temperature

298
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,760
tended to diffuse towards the
things at the lower temperature.

299
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,910
So there was a net heat
transfer in this case

300
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:26,043
that I'm showing here
from right to left.

301
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:27,710
And the question I
want to ask from this

302
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,900
is, so you're watching
this going forward.

303
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,460
And one way to
think about entropy

304
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,450
is to think, okay, what if I
saw this as my initial state

305
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,240
and I tried to rewind?

306
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,260
All right, so you see this.

307
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,050
What is the probability--

308
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,490
an experimentalist
doing-- what's

309
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,670
the probability that if
you waited long enough

310
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,010
that these things would
spontaneously go back

311
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,370
to being all cold and all hot?

312
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,160
STUDENT: 0.

313
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,080
PROFESSOR: I mean,
it's not 0, but it's

314
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,110
like in an engineering
sense, it's 0.

315
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,610
All right?

316
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,820
It's very, very unlikely.

317
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,850
Okay?

318
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,500
This is also-- have
you ever thought

319
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,190
about why time has a direction?

320
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,510
Entropy.

321
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,310
Why the universe
is going to end?

322
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,320
Entropy.

323
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,820
All right?

324
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,550
[LAUGHS]

325
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,560
The thing is that it
can decrease, though.

326
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,340
So if I take a system that's not
isolated-- so if I take, again,

327
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,950
maybe with the example that was
put before, if I have a box,

328
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,970
I can of course transfer
heat out of that.

329
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,970
So the entropy within
that box will decrease.

330
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,880
But the total entropy for
all the systems involved--

331
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,340
SO I'm transferring
out, this has

332
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,590
to be transferred somewhere
else into the environment.

333
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,390
So the delta S1
plus the delta S2

334
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,780
has always got to be
equal or greater than 0.

335
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:51,900
So the importance
of the second law

336
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,520
is it tells you what things
can happen, will occur.

337
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,460
All right?

338
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,890
And you know, we need to--
in order to describe that,

339
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,970
the first law, we talk about
the conservation of energy.

340
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,460
There are processes, like I
said before, this unwinding

341
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,590
where things can go backwards.

342
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,428
They comply with the
conservation of energy,

343
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,970
then take particles
out and all that.

344
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,510
But they're improbable because
they violate this second law.

345
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,000
And this is going to be
important for you going forward

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,960
in your engineering education is
that this principle of increase

347
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,070
in entropy, along with
conservation of energy, mass,

348
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,532
momentum, they're the basic
rules that govern the universe.

349
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:35,490
So there's some, there's
like-- this is actual,

350
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,153
honest to god truth that
you are seeing today.

351
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:39,570
When you get into
fluid mechanics,

352
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,737
you're going to be dealing
with conservation of mass

353
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:43,537
and conservation of momentum.

354
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,120
When you get into
heat transfer there,

355
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,270
you're going to be dealing with
conservation of mass, momentum,

356
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,120
and energy.

357
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,690
All right?

358
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,670
And to tell you, let's say, in
something with heat transfer,

359
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,753
if things are going to
move spontaneously and flow

360
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:55,463
from one direction to the
other, that second law.

361
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:57,380
Things move from regions
of high concentration

362
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,825
to low concentration.

363
00:16:58,825 --> 00:16:59,325
All right?

364
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:04,720
Again, when you're the party
and talking to your friends,

365
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,790
you can say that.

366
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,692
I'd go through this.

367
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,359
I'm out of time.

368
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,410
I'll just leave
you with a quote.

369
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,960
So Rudolf Clausius,
this is what he

370
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,480
wrote as the first and
second laws of thermo.

371
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,395
So this is in German.

372
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:16,770
The first is that the energy
of the universe is constant,

373
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:22,060
and the entropy of the universe
strives towards a maximum.

374
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,780
Okay?

375
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,119
So with that, you have
the increase of entropy.
