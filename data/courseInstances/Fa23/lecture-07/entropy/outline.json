      "summary": "Demonstrates the concept of reversibility using an ideal gas and tiny weights. The **irreversible process** (removing all weights at once) yields less work than the **reversible process** (removing tiny weights sequentially), showing that the latter is the maximum possible work.",

      "summary": "Defines **Entropy** ($$S$$) as a property of the system, based on the equality for a reversible cycle: $$\\oint \\\\frac{\\delta Q}{T} = 0$$. Therefore, for a reversible process, the differential change in entropy is $$\\text{d}S = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\\\right)_{\\\\text{rev}}$$.",

      "topic": "Isentropic Process",
      "summary": "Defines an **Isentropic Process** as a reversible, adiabatic process. Since both $$\\delta Q=0$$ (adiabatic) and irreversibilities are zero (reversible), then $$\\text{d}S=0$$. Entropy remains constant in an isentropic process.",
