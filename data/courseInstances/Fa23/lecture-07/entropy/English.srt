1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
PROFESSOR: So
coming back to our--

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,910
so when we were talking last
week about the Carnot cycle,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,960
we were discussing processes
that were reversible.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,460
Correct?

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,490
We talked about isothermal
adiabatic processes

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,400
that were reversible.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,510
We strung them all together and
we got this idealized cycle.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,650
I have a great book here.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,360
It's a physics book
from Alonzo Finn.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,310
A lot of today's lecture
is drawn from this.

11
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,060
For those of you who
really like old books

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,393
and are a big nerd like me,
you can go out and get that.

13
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:30,110
And in his book he
has this nice example.

14
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,697
And it's seemingly
simple, but you probably,

15
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:34,280
if you really want
to think about this

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,300
and think about reversible
and irreversible,

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,210
it's so simple but
complex at the same time.

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,780
So imagine you have
an ideal gas her.

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,360
You have some
weights on top of it.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,310
There's a pressure
on the outside

21
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,720
here, some external pressure,
some internal pressure.

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,330
It's initially at
equilibrium and you

23
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,600
got a tiny little weight.

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,030
And with this weight,
you take it off,

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,740
the piston expands a little bit.

26
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,160
It has a bit of boundary work.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,940
The pressure decreases
slightly as a result

28
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,769
and it comes into equilibrium,
and you do that many times.

29
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,750
You keeps sliding
these little weights

30
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,190
and eventually that piston
would come back up to the top.

31
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,380
And then if you repeated
the process there,

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,308
you would come back
down to the same height.

33
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:13,850
The key thing is
that if I showed you

34
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,860
this picture on the left and
this picture on the right,

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,660
and if I did a good
job scanning it,

36
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,145
you wouldn't be able to tell
the difference between the two.

37
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,520
There's no change
to your system.

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,350
There's no change in
your surroundings.

39
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,500
They are the same.

40
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,080
An irreversible process
is this example.

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,130
So imagine here I have a weight
A that's initially on here

42
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,520
and I take it off.

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,000
This thing is going to
expand very rapidly.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,650
So this thing is going to move
up really quickly to there.

45
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,890
It's going to come
up to this height.

46
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,420
To bring the piston head back
down to the original height,

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,900
you then take this weight
B and you put it on there

48
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,010
and you come back.

49
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,230
And you look at the system
and you say, hey, look,

50
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,600
this thing is the
same as this thing.

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,460
That's reversible.

52
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,550
Except it isn't.

53
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,263
Because if I was to show you the
picture of the one on the left

54
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:01,930
and the picture in
the one on the right,

55
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,470
you would agree, hopefully,
that they are not the same.

56
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,078
Your surroundings have changed.

57
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:10,620
This is going to take you more
than the 30 seconds of looking

58
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,410
at it to process.

59
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,070
It's in your slides.

60
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,737
But come back to this
and think about it

61
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:15,900
because this is a
great example of what

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,553
reversible and
irreversible mean.

63
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:20,720
So you point out that there.

64
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,570
I just walked you through it.

65
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,580
You slide that weight over,
you slide the other one.

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,122
And the key thing
to pay attention to

67
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:28,190
is that these things are
not the same up here.

68
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,980
It goes without saying, too,
that reversible processes tend

69
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,070
to put out more work.

70
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,820
So as engineers, we're
interested in being

71
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,130
as close to reversible
as we possibly can.

72
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,850
Okay, that's on that.

73
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,422
So to help a little bit with
you being able to at your party

74
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:44,130
to explain the history
of thermodynamics,

75
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,290
we can about this book.

76
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,165
So this is a book written
by Rudolf Clausius.

77
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,350
Rudolf Clausius, again,
first chair of physics at

78
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,910
[INDISCERNIBLE] in Zurich.

79
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,012
He was the one who really sort
of formalized the second law.

80
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:58,720
So it was really Sadi Carnot who
wrote about it and had it there.

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,920
He used caloric theory,
which was wrong.

82
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,200
Clausius took it, polished
it, repackaged it there.

83
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,823
And in this book-- he has
many books and many things

84
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:08,240
that he wrote, but
he has this one

85
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,320
which is an English translation
of his of his German text, where

86
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,070
he looked at the
mechanical theory of heat

87
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,167
and the application
of it to heat engines.

88
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,250
Because, remember, the
whole thing is interesting.

89
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,208
You want to take heat
and you want to get work.

90
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,875
You want to maximize the amount
of work you get out for the heat

91
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:22,600
that you put in.

92
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,808
So you're obsessed with this.

93
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:27,010
I want to get as much
out as I can put in.

94
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,940
And as we had seen before, when
we had this piston example,

95
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,210
we know that with that ideal
gas, if we let the thing expand

96
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,485
there, we can get exactly the
amount of work out as we put in.

97
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,610
But to make it a cycle, we
need to bring that back.

98
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,027
And to bring that
piston head back

99
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:45,817
required transferring
heat out to cool it,

100
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,400
to bring it back to
the initial state.

101
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,110
And for all cycles require that.

102
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,870
You don't just get to keep
pumping heat in, in, in, in,

103
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,660
and get it.

104
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,510
As James told us, if
we keep doing that,

105
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,302
what would happen to
our system, James?

106
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,510
STUDENT: Sorry I was reading.

107
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,218
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

108
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,250
Anyways, it blows up.

109
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,250
He's so engrossed in it.

110
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,060
That's wonderful.

111
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,143
He's going to be very fun
at the party to talk to.

112
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:06,233
So anyway, so the point is
that we know a bit about that.

113
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,900
We're going to have
to put some heat in.

114
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,240
We're going to have
to take some heat out,

115
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,660
and we're going
to get some work.

116
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,570
And what we're going
to sense out of this

117
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,300
is that not all heat
is created the same.

118
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,820
So if I have a reservoir
and I transfer heat

119
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,100
from it at a high
temperature, this

120
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,190
is probably not going to be
the same as transferring heat

121
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,930
as a low temperature, as we know
now in how we produce energy.

122
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,640
And this is what
Clausius was looking at.

123
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,220
So if you look at his book--

124
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,270
again, I'm going to spare
you the details on it.

125
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,510
But the key point here, in this
500 voluminous page text, is he

126
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,670
writes this statement
about how he's

127
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,983
trying to link that
work out with the heat

128
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:46,900
that he's bringing in.

129
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,300
And he says that the work that
I'm trying to transfer out

130
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,430
is not going to be equal,
basically, proportional

131
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,460
to this Q. It's going to be
proportional to the Q divided

132
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,380
by the temperature
of the reservoir.

133
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,500
Now, this is deep shit.

134
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,950
Like, we're not going
to get this today.

135
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,490
You're going to think
about this for 10 years,

136
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,532
and I swear to God, if
you can do it in 10 years,

137
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:06,878
I'll be proud of you.

138
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:08,170
But this is what he's thinking.

139
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,900
So he's thinking,
all right, so if I'm

140
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,010
going to make them
equivalent and all of that,

141
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,552
probably I'm going
to have to control

142
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:16,380
for the for the temperature,
and this is what he writes.

143
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,370
But Q divided by T is going to
be key to the linking with this

144
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,772
with this work.

145
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,480
So coming back to entropy, since
most of you have heard about it.

146
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,770
So the change in entropy for
a reversible process is dS.

147
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,370
So if this differential S
is equal to dQ divided by T.

148
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,560
And this is for a for
a reversible process.

149
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,680
This is why I'm writing this
as an exact differential, where

150
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
the capital letter S is entropy.

151
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,980
And I'm writing this statement.

152
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,720
This is historically
how it was defined.

153
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,710
And my evidence, my receipts
of that are the previous slide.

154
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,460
That's how he developed it.

155
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,723
Has the units of
joules per Kelvin.

156
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:04,140
If it was little
less, it would be

157
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,220
joules per kilogram per Kelvin.

158
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,390
And it's from the
Greek for ergon, work,

159
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,320
like energy we
talked about before.

160
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,160
Entropy, transformation.

161
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,400
In his [INDISCERNIBLE]
classes, his [INDISCERNIBLE]

162
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,890
he calls this disgregation.

163
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,480
It's like the
opposite of aggregate.

164
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,813
So you have something aggregate.

165
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:27,510
The opposite of
aggregate is this word.

166
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,180
And he had another word,
transformational content,

167
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,682
like [GERMAN] or something
in German, just whatever.

168
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,890
Anyways, there was a Nobel
prize winner, Leon Cooper,

169
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,260
who supposedly,
according to Wikipedia,

170
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,220
is who the guy in big bang
theory is named after,

171
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,190
Sheldon Cooper.

172
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,470
So apparently it's this guy.

173
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,290
It doesn't matter.

174
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,680
So he said about
Clausius that in having

175
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,260
this nice word of
entropy, he succeeded

176
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,660
in coining a word that meant
the same thing to everybody,

177
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,750
nothing.

178
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:00,690
So, again, it's very difficult.
Entropy is a difficult term.

179
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,970
So if we can go
through and try to link

180
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,510
this change in entropy to heat
or linking entropy and heat.

181
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,610
So if we take that dS
is equal to the dQ by T

182
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,190
and we integrate, since entropy
is a property, so this is not

183
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,850
a path function,
this is a property.

184
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,960
So we have S2 minus S1 is then
equal to the integral there.

185
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,750
And it can be negative
or it can be positive,

186
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,720
depending on if heat is
absorbed or rejected.

187
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,830
And the reason for
this is that the T

188
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,080
that we're dealing with here
is the so-called absolute

189
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,520
temperature,
absolute temperature.

190
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,380
So this is Kelvin.

191
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,252
And in the Kelvin scale, there
is no negative temperature

192
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:48,960
unless you're doing some really,
really, really weird experiments

193
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,890
in the lab there.

194
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,563
So it's a positive quantity.

195
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,195
And so if you take--

196
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:06,570
again, so now we've linked
this change in entropy to heat

197
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,100
and we can look
at a special case.

198
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,480
If we're dealing with
an adiabatic, so no heat

199
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,070
transfer, reversible
transformation,

200
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,920
so because it's adiabatic,
the dQ is equal to 0.

201
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:27,485
And so the S2 minus the
S1 is then equal to 0.

202
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,809
And so for that reason,
adiabatic reversible

203
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,150
transformations are
also called isentropic.

204
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,470
So isentropic means
constant entropy.

205
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,250
We had isothermal,
constant temperature;

206
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,920
isobaric, constant pressure;
isochoric, constant volume;

207
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,120
isentropic, constant entropy.

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,680
Have we seen an isentropic
process already, actually?

209
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,310
Yes, you have.

210
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,990
If you came last
week, you saw one.

211
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,880
So if you want to
see this plotted,

212
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,350
so again, we love our diagram.

213
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,950
So we had our P-V
diagrams and all of that.

214
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,630
Very important one, when
we're analyzing systems

215
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,060
according to first and
second law principles

216
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,283
is what's called
the T-S diagram.

217
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:26,200
So on the vertical axis,
you have temperature.

218
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,480
On the horizontal,
you have entropy.

219
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,540
Let's say you start
at some state A1

220
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:39,560
and you finish at some state A2,
and this is your transformation.

221
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,940
The heat that you
transfer is then

222
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,660
equal to the integral from
state 1 to state 2 of this.

223
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,040
So basically, it's the area,
the shaded area that I draw here

224
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,640
under this curve, is the
heat that you transfer

225
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,090
for reversible transformation.

226
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,550
So if you thought
about, when we were

227
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,560
looking at something
like the Carnot cycle,

228
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,590
so we were looking at T
and we were looking at S,

229
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:16,050
and we were drawing those boxes
from our different states.

230
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,370
So in this case, let's
say this is the T cold

231
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,750
and this is the T hot.

232
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,280
So for the low part here, we
could integrate and have this.

233
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,230
For the higher part
here, we'd have

234
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,330
to do the integrate
all of that area.

235
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:39,965
And the isentropic part of
it is where it's constant.

236
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:41,215
So that's how that looks like.

237
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,410
And just like I've
drawn here, if you

238
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,290
were to take the integral
over the entire cycle,

239
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,230
so if you were to take
the integral over--

240
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,760
I'm smashing chalk back here.

241
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,260
If you're taking
the integral, then,

242
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,090
over this whole
cycle, as I have here,

243
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,180
so if you end up where
you end up before,

244
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,240
the amount of the
net, basically,

245
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,570
heat that you transfer is that,
just like I showed you here.

246
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,650
So you do this first process
here, this is an arbitrary one.

247
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,570
And you go back, then the net
heat absorbed by the system

248
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,790
is the is the shaded area.

249
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,410
And importantly,
for us as engineers,

250
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,720
that is going to be equivalent
to the work done by the system

251
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,750
during the cycle.

252
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,417
Because, you remember, before we
were dealing with these control

253
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:43,670
volumes, and in those cases,
in a cycle of a control volume

254
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,560
like that with no mass
in and no mass out,

255
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,710
the work done is equal
to the net heat absorbed.

256
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
And so I'm writing this
sentence and I'm saying,

257
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,855
entropy is a
variable that may be

258
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:11,050
used to describe a
process in the same way

259
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:17,620
that pressure, volume,
or temperature do.

260
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,543
And we can start out
by trying to say--

261
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:23,210
I mean, first of all, you might
read that and say, no, it isn't.

262
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,290
It doesn't make any sense to me.

263
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,957
So we can start by
thinking, let's start

264
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:27,830
with the one with pressure.

265
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:33,520
So if we're thinking
about how the relationship

266
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,820
between pressure and
energy, so we're sometimes

267
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,890
talking about like P dV, so
if we think about the boundary

268
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,120
work, so the pressure for,
for isobaric processes,

269
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,750
so the pressure times
the change in the volume

270
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,480
is going to be the
work that you do.

271
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,470
In the same way, if I
think about temperature

272
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,430
times the change in
entropy, it's the same.

273
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,810
What type of property are
pressure and temperature?

274
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,724
Are they intensive or extensive?

275
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:18,720
STUDENT: Intensive?

276
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,710
PROFESSOR: Intensive.

277
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,966
What type of
properties is volume?

278
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,000
STUDENT: Extensive--

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,088
PROFESSOR: What type of property
do you think entropy is then?

280
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:27,880
STUDENT: Extensive?

281
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

282
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,480
So these things depend on
the size of the system.

283
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,080
What's difficult, if I told
you like to measure pressure,

284
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,547
that would be straightforward.

285
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,630
If I told you to measure
temperature of this room,

286
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,710
it would be straightforward.

287
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,810
If I told you to measure
the volume of this room,

288
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,550
you might say, screw you.

289
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,390
That's really hard.

290
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,930
But if I gave you a tape
measure and a lot of money,

291
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,000
probably you would do it.

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,030
If I asked you to measure
the entropy of the room,

293
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,590
that's not so straightforward.

294
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,895
We'd have to do something
with this link of Q. Maybe

295
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:04,020
we're doing something with
like a heat transfer in.

296
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,890
We're looking at a
temperature response,

297
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,348
and then we're
getting the entropy.

298
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,200
It's not as obvious.

299
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,810
So use these analogies with
kind of a grain of salt,

300
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:19,840
but that's just to give
you a sense of that.

301
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,260
And you'll find
it in the tables.

302
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,610
So if you look in
the tables, again,

303
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,985
like I said before,
so you'll see

304
00:14:23,985 --> 00:14:29,470
it's the little s, which is
then in the units of kilojoules

305
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,500
per kilogram Kelvin.

306
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,210
And so if we look at,
again, another special case,

307
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,370
so here if we look at the
instead of an adiabatic,

308
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,020
if we look at the isothermal,
so the change in entropy

309
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,850
during an isothermal
reversible process,

310
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,260
so recall before we had this
equation S2 minus S1 was

311
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,340
equal to this integral.

312
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,840
If the temperature
is constant, it's

313
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,830
not being affected
by the heat transfer.

314
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:11,280
So if it's reversible, we
have the little d, not delta,

315
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,380
little dQ.

316
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,023
So that just becomes Q
over T, so maybe this

317
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:19,440
is how we'd end up trying to
measure the change in entropy

318
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,600
of the room is with some type of
system like that, of Q's and T's

319
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,670
amount of known heat transfer at
a specific temperature for it.

320
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,740
And what can you use this for?

321
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,990
So I'm giving you this
example with water.

322
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,980
It's a pretty simple
example with water.

323
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,880
So if we take ice at
STP, so if we take ice

324
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,410
at 1 bar atmospheric
pressure here,

325
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:57,960
it's going to melt at 273.15
Kelvin or 0 degrees C.

326
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:05,790
What's known is that it'll
absorb 1,435 calories per mole

327
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,978
to melt. So that is because this
is a constant pressure process.

328
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:12,020
Phase change here is a
constant pressure process.

329
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:20,800
If we're looking at going from
pure ice here into a liquid,

330
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:28,810
and if the phase change is
P is equal to a constant

331
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,880
there, what we're going
to be able to do is we

332
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,680
can define the
enthalpy of melting.

333
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,160
So this is also table values.

334
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
You can look up to this.

335
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,430
Remember when we did
for vaporization,

336
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,990
we had the liquid to vapor.

337
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,800
We had an enthalpy that was HFG.

338
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,200
The difference between
the enthalpy when

339
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,890
you're a vapor and
you're a liquid,

340
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,200
you have this for vaporization.

341
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,070
At our conditions, it's 2,200
joules per gram or 2,200

342
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,220
kilojoules per kilogram.

343
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,730
It's a lot for melting.

344
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,510
When it's melting, this value
is about an order of magnitude

345
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,010
less.

346
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,220
It's still substantial, but
it's about an order of magnitude

347
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,720
less.

348
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,940
That's about 333
kilojoules per kilogram.

349
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:22,450
And if you then want to say what
is the entropy for this process,

350
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:28,450
so we can write back
up here, we have our Q.

351
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:34,570
So we have this Q is being equal
to T, to the temperature when

352
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,720
we transfer it.

353
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,420
As we know from melting, the
ice doesn't change temperature

354
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,310
when it's melting,
so this mixed region

355
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,435
is going to be a constant
temperature process, too.

356
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:49,270
So we have the T,
which is 273 Kelvin,

357
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:56,300
and then we have
the S2 minus S1.

358
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,580
And then here, if it's
capital S's, it'll

359
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,910
basically work like that.

360
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,720
And so you rearrange
this, and you'll

361
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:15,280
have this delta S as being equal
to the Q divided by the T, which

362
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,780
from what we know
before, if we have

363
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,850
the mass of the substance
times the delta H divided by--

364
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,400
or times the H value
that I have there,

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,510
and I'm going to be able to
write the change like that.

366
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,068
So that's how you
would go about that.

367
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:36,610
So the relationship then in this
case for the melting process

368
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,130
is the change in entropy is
equal to the heat absorbed,

369
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,300
the latent heat absorbed
during that process, which

370
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,570
for capital S is then MH and
then divided by the temperature

371
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,880
that we had.

372
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,580
If this wasn't capital S, but
it was little s, so if this

373
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,620
was done on a on
a per mass basis

374
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:11,530
and you substituted the values,
then this delta little s

375
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:18,040
would be equal to this
333 kilojoule per kilogram

376
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,100
divided by the 273.15 Kelvin.

377
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,570
And according to
my calculations,

378
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:31,185
I have something like 1.22
kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin.

379
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,630
So that's the link
between heat transferred

380
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,740
and the entropy
change of your system.

381
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,290
Okay?
