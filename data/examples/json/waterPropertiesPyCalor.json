  "physical_laws_and_assumptions": "Pure substance. Dependent properties only depend upon two independent properties. We can use the property tables in the book to determine the answers or we can use \"digital\" tables. Here we will use the digital tables. In order to calculate a thermodynamic property, we need to define several properties, such as temperature $T$ and pressure $p$, and for vapor-liquid mixtures, the quality $x$. We then have enough information to calculate all of the thermodynamic properties at this state. The first step in determining properties like $p$, specific entropy $s$, specific enthalpy $h$, etc., is to use the `pyCalor` module.",

  "pedagogical_summary": "Based on this plot, we can see that water is in a superheated vapor state. Since it is in a superheated vapor state, that is why pressure and temperature are independent variables. If it was in the saturated liquid-vapor region, that would not be the case."
