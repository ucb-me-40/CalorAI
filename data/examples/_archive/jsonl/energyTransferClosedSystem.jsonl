The governing principle is the **Conservation of Energy**, or the First Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the change in the system's energy equals the net energy transfer across its boundary.\n2.  **Apply the First Law (General Form):** The general energy balance is $\\Delta E_{\\text{system}} = E_{\\text{in}} - E_{\\text{out}}$.\n3.  **Simplify Energy Balance:** For a stationary closed system, neglecting changes in kinetic ($\Delta KE$) and potential ($\Delta PE$) energy, the system's total energy change simplifies to the change in **Internal Energy** ($\Delta U$). The energy transfers are composed of net Heat and net Work. The simplified equation becomes:\n    $$\\Delta U = U_2 - U_1 = (Q_{\\text{in}} - Q_{\\text{out}}) + (W_{\\text{in}} - W_{\\text{out}})$$\n4.  **Solve for $U_2$:** Substitute the known values for $U_1$, $W_{\\text{in}}$, and $Q_{\\text{out}}$ into the simplified equation to find the final internal energy, $U_2$.\n\n### \u2705 Study Guide\n\n| Material | Reference | Topic |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Book Chapter** | Chapter 2: **Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis** | Provides the foundational theory for the Conservation of Energy and the general energy balance equation. |\n| **Book Section** | Section 2-6: **The First Law of Thermodynamics** | Explains the specific application and components of the First Law (Heat, Work, Internal Energy). |\n| **Lecture Video** | **Energy balance of a system** (Fa25-L2a-11.0) | A direct example reviewing the energy balance for a closed, non-flow system with work and heat transfer. |\n| **Syllabus** | **Learning Objective: Application** | This problem aligns with the objective to \"Solve simple single-answer problems using the first law.\" |"}
