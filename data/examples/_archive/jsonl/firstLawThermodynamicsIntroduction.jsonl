It is conserved.\n\n**Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** of the system. This means its value depends only on the instantaneous state (condition) of the system (e.g., its temperature, pressure, and volume), not on how the system reached that state.\n\n### \u2795 Step 2: Role of Internal Energy in a Cyclic Process\n\nA **cyclic process** is one where the system returns to its initial state, meaning the initial and final properties are identical ($State_1 = State_2$).\n\nSince internal energy ($U$) is a property, the net change in internal energy over a cycle must be zero:\n\n$$\\Delta U_{\\text{cycle}} = U_{\\text{final}} - U_{\\text{initial}} = U_1 - U_1 = 0$$\n\nIn differential (integral) form: \n$$\\mathbf{\\oint dU = 0}$$\n\n### \u2795 Step 3: Mathematical Statement of the First Law (Cyclic Process)\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics states that the net energy transfer to a system equals the change in the system's total energy ($\Delta E_{\\text{system}}$):\n\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{system}} = E_{\\text{in}} - E_{\\text{out}} = Q_{\\text{net, in}} - W_{\\text{net, out}}$$\n\nIn differential form, assuming $\\Delta KE = 0$ and $\\Delta PE = 0$, $dE_{\\text{system}} = dU$:\n\n$$\\delta Q - \\delta W = dU$$\n\nApplying the cyclic integral to this equation:\n\n$$\\oint (\\delta Q - \\delta W) = \\oint dU$$\n\nSince $\\oint dU = 0$ for a cycle (Step 2), the First Law simplifies to:\n\n$$\\mathbf{\\oint \\delta Q = \\oint \\delta W}$$\n\n**Conclusion:** This relation shows that in a cyclic process, the **net heat transfer must be equal to the net work transfer**.
