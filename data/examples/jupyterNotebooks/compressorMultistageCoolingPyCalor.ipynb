    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "Problem 7-190 from Cengels Thermodynamics 9th Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "Air enters a two-stage compressor at 100 kPa and 27Â°C and is compressed to 625 kPa. The pressure ratio across each stage is the same, and the air is cooled to the initial temperature between the two stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**:\n",
    "- Assuming the compression process to be isentropic, determine the power input to the compressor for a mass flow rate of 0.15 kg/s.\n",
    "- What would your answer be if only one stage of compression were used?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Schematic\n",
    "Draw two compressors connected in series. State 1 and 2 are the inlet and outlet of the first air compressor, respectively. States 3 and 4 are at the inlet and exit of the second air compressor, respectively. Heat is transferred out in between states 2 and 3. Indicate that the compressors are connected together by a shaft and that work is being transferred in. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Assumptions and Approximations\n",
    "* **Control Volume** (mass crosses the boundary).\n",
    "* We will use pyCalor to determine properties.\n",
    "* Neglect kinetic and potential energy ($\\Delta KE \\approx 0$, $\\Delta PE \\approx 0$).\n",
    "* Compression from states 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 are considered **Reversible processes**.\n",
    "* Compression from states 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 are considered **Adiabatic processes**.\n",
    "* **Steady-flow process** ($\\Delta m_\\text{CV}= 0$, $\\Delta E_\\text{CV}= 0$, $\\Delta S_\\text{CV}= 0$).\n",
    "* We have a single inlet and outlet ($\\dot{m}_\\text{in}$ and $\\dot{m}_\\text{out}$).\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations\n",
    "1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Control Volume):**\n",
    "    $$\\frac{dE_\\text{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{E}_\\text{in} - \\dot{E}_\\text{out}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Conservation of Mass (Mass Balance for a Control Volume):**\n",
    "    $$\\frac{dm_\\text{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{m}_\\text{in} - \\dot{m}_\\text{out}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a steady flow process, we can write:\n",
    "$$\\dot{E}_\\text{in} = \\dot{E}_\\text{out}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{m}_\\text{in} = \\dot{m}_\\text{out} = \\dot{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
