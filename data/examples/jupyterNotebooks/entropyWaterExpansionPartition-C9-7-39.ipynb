    "## 7. Summary and Reasoning\n",
    "We were able to determine the change in entropy of this process by recognizing that there was no change in mass in the system and that entropy is a property. Therefore, by defining the initial and final states, we were able to determine the change in entropy of the water during this expansion process. We note that there were contributions to change in entropy from expansion and heat transfer. In order to determine $S_\\text{in}$  and $S_\\text{gen}$ we would have to break the process down into two steps. The first would be adiabatic expansion of the compressed liquid into the vacuum. Since there is no heat or work transfer, the internal energy wouldn't change, so we would know the specific internal energy. We also know the final volume and therefore specific volume. With that we can determine the state after expansion and therefore $S_\\text{gen}$. After that we could allow heat to be transferred in. Since we know $\\Delta S_\\text{system}$ and $S_\\text{gen}$, we could determine $S_\\text{in} - S_\\text{out}$. Since in this problem heat is being transferred in, $S_\\text{out} = 0$, and we would then know $S_\\text{in}$."
