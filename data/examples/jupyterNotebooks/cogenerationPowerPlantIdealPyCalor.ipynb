    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "Consider an ideal cogeneration plant. Steam enters the turbine at 7 MPa and 500$^\\circ$C. Some steam is extracted from the turbine at 500 kPa for process heating. The remaining steam continues to expand to 5 kPa. Steam is then condensed at constant pressure and pumped to the boiler pressure of 7 MPa. At times of high demand for process heat, some steam leaving the boiler is throttled to 500 kPa and is routed to the process heater. The extraction fractions are adjusted so that steam leaves the process heater as a saturated liquid at 500 kPa. It is subsequently pumped to 7 MPa. The mass flow rate of steam through the boiler is 15 kg/s. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Determine:\n",
    "* (a) The maximum rate at which process heat can be supplied;\n",
    "* (b) the power produced when no process heat is supplied;\n",
    "* (c) the rate of process heat supply when 10% of the steam is extracted before it enters the turbine and 70% of the steam is extracted from the turbine at 500 kPa for process heating. "

Work is transferred into the two pumps and out of the turbine. Draw the control volume around each of the steady-flow devices. Indicate that heat is transferred into the boiler. Indicate that shaft work is transferred into the pump. Indicate that shaft work is transferred out of the steam turbines.

One can adjust the mass flow rates directly to the process heater and that from the turbine to the process heater to see how this factor changes. This of course depends on the need for process heat.
