    "\n",
    "An **air-standard Carnot cycle** is executed in a closed system between the temperature limits of $T_L$ and $T_H$ (K). The pressures before and after the isothermal compression are $p_1$ and $p_2$ (kPa), respectively. The net work output per cycle is $W_{\\text{net}}$ (kJ). Air is assumed to have constant specific heats at standard conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Lower temperature: $T_L$ (K)\n",
    "- Higher temperature: $T_H$ (K)\n",
    "- Pressure before isothermal compression: $p_1$ (kPa)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **1→2:** Isothermal compression at the low temperature $T_L$. Heat $Q_{\\text{out}}$ is rejected to the surroundings, and the pressure increases from $p_1$ to $p_2$.\n",
    "2. **2→3:** Isentropic compression from temperature $T_L$ to $T_H$. Pressure increases from $p_2$ to $p_3$.\n",
    "3. **3→4:** Isothermal expansion at the high temperature $T_H$. Heat $Q_{\\text{in}}$ is added to the system.\n",
