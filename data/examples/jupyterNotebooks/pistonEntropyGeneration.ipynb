So we will compute the change in entropy of the piston cylinder device first and then the change in entropy of the surroundings. The entropy generated then is the sum of the change in entropy of both systems. Since the combined system is adiabatic, we can say that there is no entropy transferred in or out:\n",

    "To analyze this problem, we created two control volumes. One around the water and the other of its surroundings. The water reduced its entropy, which makes sense since heat was transferred out. We were able to determine this change in entropy because the work process was isothermal and internally reversible. We were able to determine the change in entropy of the surroundings by treating it as a thermal reservoir. The entropy of the surroundings increased, which makes sense since heat was transferred into it. We also determined the entropy generated in this process, which increased, as well as the exergy destruction, which was greater than zero as expected."
