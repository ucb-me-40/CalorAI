    "We analyzed exergy destruction via two ways. One was to do an entropy analysis of a control volume and determine entropy generation. From here we were able to multiple that by the dead state temperature, $T_0$, and we determined exergy destruction. Alternatively, we did an exergy analysis of a control volume and directly determined the rate of exergy destruction. The two approaches produced the same answer. One can use this as an important step to defining the **Second Law Efficiency** of a system. "
