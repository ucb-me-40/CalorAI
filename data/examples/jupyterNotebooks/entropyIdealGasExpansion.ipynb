    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "A rigid container contains 1 kg of air initially at 1 bar, which is connected to another evacuated rigid container ov volume 1 m$^3$ with a valve. The entire system is kept in contact with a thermal reservoir at 300 K. Now the valve is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Determine the change in entropy of the air. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Schematic \n",
    "\n",
    "Draw a schematic that shows one container connected to another. Indicate that the temperature is kept constant. Draw a boundary around the left container and indicate state 1. Draw an expanded boundary that includes both containers and call that state 2. No mass in or out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Assumptions and Approximations\n",
    "* **Closed System** (no change in mass).\n",
    "* Ideal gas. \n",
    "* Neglect kinetic and potential energy ($\\Delta KE \\approx 0$, $\\Delta PE \\approx 0$).\n",
    "* **Pure Substance** We can use pyCalor to determine properties such as specific entropy \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Physical Laws\n",
    "Since we are determining the change in entropy of the gas from state 1 to state 2, we can simply determine the specific entropy at state 2 and state 2. The change in entropy is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta S = S_2 - S_1 = m (s_2 - s_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know state 1, but we need to determine state 2. We know that $p_1 =$101,325 Pa. For state 2, we need the pressure, $p_2$, which we can determine it from the ideal gas equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_2 = m R T_2 / V_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that $V_2$ is equal to the volume of both containers, $V_2 = V_I + V_{II}$. We can determine the volume of container 1 as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_1 = m R T_1/p_1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V_I = V_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume at state 2 is then:\n",
    "$$V_2 = (m R T_1/p_1) + V_{II} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_2 = m R T_2 / V_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the pressure and the temperature at state 2, we have complete information since it's a pure substance, so we can use `pyCalor` to determine its specific entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Alternative solution **\n",
    "Alternatively, we can relate changes in properties to changes in entropy through the $Tds$ relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T ds = du + p dv $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming an ideal gas:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T ds = c_v dT + p dv $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming constant specific heats, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_2 - s_1 = c_p \\ln \\frac{T_2}{T_2} - R \\ln \\frac{p_2}{p_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's an isothermal process:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_2 - s_1 = - R \\ln \\frac{p_2}{p_1}$$"
