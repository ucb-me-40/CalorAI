Entropy changes in a closed system is due to entropy transfer from heat transfer and entropy generation within the system boundaries:\n",

    "Sometimes this is not a very convenient or intuitive way to analyze such problems. Oftentimes we are interested in entropy generated within an entire Closed System that is adiabatic.
