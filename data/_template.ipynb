    "For a closed system, no mass can flow across its boundaries, and its entropy change is simply the difference between the initial and final entropies of the system. Entropy changes in a closed system is due to entropy transfer from heat transfer and entropy generation within the system boundaries:\n",

    "Sometimes this is not a very convenient or intuitive way to analyze such problems. Oftentimes we are interested in entropy generated within an entire Closed System that is adiabatic. For that, we can determine $S_\\text{gen}$ by summing up all of the changes in entropy for each control volume since there is no entropy entering or leaving the combined system.
