    "A vertical, frictionless piston–cylinder contains a gas. The piston has mass $m_\\mathrm{p}$ and cross-sectional area $A$. The local atmospheric pressure is $P_\\mathrm{atm}$. Gravitational acceleration is $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$. \n",

    "- Determine the absolute pressure of the gas inside the cylinder, $p$ (in **bar**), under static equilibrium.\n",
    "- If the gas is heated at quasi-equilibrium such that its volume doubles while the piston moves freely (no stops, negligible friction, constant external conditions), state whether the cylinder pressure changes. Explain briefly.\n",

    "## 2. Schematic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Device:** Vertical piston–cylinder containing a generic gas.\n",

    "**Boundary:** The control volume is the gas inside the cylinder up to the inner face of the piston and cylinder walls. The piston is exposed on its top face to the ambient atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forces/pressures:**\n",
    "- Inside gas exerts pressure $p$ upward on the piston.\n",
    "- Outside, the atmosphere exerts $P_\\mathrm{atm}$ downward; the piston weight $m_\\mathrm{p} g$ also acts downward. Friction is negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process description:**\n",
    "- Initial static equilibrium: piston at rest, pressure uniform within the gas.\n",
    "- Heating step (if applied): quasi-equilibrium expansion moves the piston upward; the boundary work crosses the control surface. Adiabatic walls are not assumed; only the force balance is relevant for pressure.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Quasi-static (mechanical) equilibrium:** The piston moves slowly or is at rest so that pressure in the gas is spatially uniform and the piston force balance is valid.\n",
    "- **Negligible friction and seal drag:** No significant opposing frictional force on the piston; otherwise include it as an extra term.\n",
    "- **Rigid, massless connecting components:** Piston rod inertia neglected; piston mass accounted for explicitly.\n",
    "- **Uniform atmospheric pressure:** $P_\\mathrm{atm}$ is constant over the piston face.\n",
    "- **No stops or springs:** Unless stated, there are no mechanical constraints or spring forces; only atmosphere and weight act externally.\n",
    "- **Closed system for the gas:** No mass transfer; only boundary work/heat may cross.\n",
    "- **Neglect kinetic and potential energy changes of the gas:** Not needed for static pressure computation."
