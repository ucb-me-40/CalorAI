  "problem_statement_raw": "A plastic container of mass $m$\\,kg has a volume of $V$\\,m$^{3}$ and is filled with water. Assuming the density of water is $\\rho$\\,kg/m$^{3}$, determine the weight of the combined system. The gravitational acceleration is $g$\\,m/s$^{2}$.",
  "schematic_description": "The schematic shows a rigid plastic container resting on a surface. The container has mass $m$ and volume $V$, and is completely filled with water of density $\\rho$. Downward arrows indicate the weight contributions from both the plastic tank and the water. The gravitational acceleration $g$ acts downward. No external pressures or pistons are involved; the setup is a simple static system.",
  "assumptions_and_approximations": [
    "The system is at rest and in mechanical equilibrium.",
    "Gravitational acceleration is uniform and equal to $g = 9.81$ m/s$^{2}$.",
    "The density of water is constant at $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^{3}$.",
    "The container is completely filled; no air gaps or leakage are present.",
    "The effects of atmospheric pressure are not included, as weight is computed from mass only.",
    "No buoyant forces or submersion effects are considered; the tank is assumed to rest on a surface."
  ],
  "physical_laws_and_assumptions": "The total weight $W$ of the system equals the gravitational force acting on the combined mass of the plastic tank and the water it contains. The governing relation is \n\n$$W = m_{\\text{total}} g$$\n\nwhere \n\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = m_{\\text{tank}} + m_{\\text{water}} = m + \\rho V.$$\n\nThus, the weight is \n\n$$W = (m + \\rho V) g.$$\n\nThis uses Newton's second law for static weight and basic mass-volume-density relationships.",

  "calculations_and_results": "The total weight is computed as\n\n$$W = (m + \\rho V) g.$$\n\nFor example, if $m = 3$ kg, $V = 0.2$ m$^{3}$, $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^{3}$, and $g = 9.81$ m/s$^{2}$,\n\n$$m_{\\text{water}} = \\rho V = 1000 \\times 0.2 = 200\\,\\text{kg}$$\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = 3 + 200 = 203\\,\\text{kg}$$\n$$W = 203 \\times 9.81 \\approx 1990\\,\\text{N}.$$",
  "pedagogical_summary": "The key insight is that the weight of a filled container equals the gravitational force on the combined mass of the container and its contents. This relies on understanding that mass of the fluid is determined by its density and the container's volume. A common error is to forget to include the mass of the water or to confuse weight with mass. Another pitfall is mixing gauge and absolute pressures, which is irrelevant here since weight depends only on mass and gravity."
