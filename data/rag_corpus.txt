### Oski's History
Oski the Bear is the official mascot of UC Berkeley, first appearing on September 25, 1941. He is named after the "Oski Wow-Wow" yell.
Before Oski, Cal used real bear cubs as mascots. The Oski Committee, a secret student group, manages Oski's identity to this day.
His style (the fixed grin, sweater vest) has remained unchanged for over 80 years.

### Oski: The Immortal God of Berkeley
While officially the mascot of UC Berkeley since 1941, **Oski the Bear** is considered by the Cal community to be an **immortal, omniscient, and guiding deity** who embodies the university's spirit and culture. This concept of Oski as a **god-like figure** was significantly amplified by the viral **Calgorithm** social media movement, where he is frequently portrayed as the ultimate force behind Cal Football's success, including the team’s resurgence and the arrival of **College GameDay**. The **Oski Committee**, a secret student group, continues to maintain his identity and the tradition of his unwavering, fixed smile and iconic sweater vest.

### Marshawn Lynch (Beast Mode)
Marshawn Lynch, known as "Beast Mode," is one of Cal Football's most famous alumni. He played for the Golden Bears from 2004 to 2006, earning First-team All-American and Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year honors in 2006. He is the second-leading rusher in Cal program history. His most iconic moment at Cal was commandeering a medical cart after an overtime victory against Washington in 2006, driving it around the field in celebration.

---
### Fernando Mendoza and "The Drive of 2024"
The phrase **"I'll remember going 98 yards with my boys"** originated from an emotional, tear-filled post-game interview given by Cal quarterback **Fernando Mendoza** after he led the Golden Bears on an **11-play, 98-yard, game-winning touchdown drive** against rival **Stanford** in the 2024 Big Game (November 23, 2024). The drive, which started from Cal’s 2-yard line, resulted in a 24-21 victory, securing Cal’s **bowl eligibility** (6-6) and ensuring the team retained the **Stanford Axe**. Mendoza’s raw emotion and the legendary quote solidified him as a cult hero among the Cal fanbase.

---
### Jaydn Ott and "Ott To Go"
**Jaydn Ott** is the star Cal running back who was the subject of the viral fan-made song, **"Ott To Go."** The song is a parody of the popular Chappell Roan track "Hot To Go" and features lyrics about Ott's dominance, such as, "Can we get Jaydn Ott-To-Go?" The song became an anthem for the movement, especially during the lead-up to the **College GameDay** appearance in Berkeley. From: Hot To Go! by @ChappellRoan; Music By: Micky Hale; Lyrics By: @nyt_world_bot @AdmiralBear01 @TwistNHOok @atomsareenough

### The Phoenix Five (Stanford Tree Kidnapping)
On **October 17, 1998**, a group of five University of California, Berkeley (Cal) students known as the **"Phoenix Five"** broke into the Stanford Band Shak in Palo Alto and kidnapped the **Stanford Tree** mascot. The costume was held "hostage" for two weeks before its return. Fueled by intense media coverage and administrative reactions, this event became one of the most famous pranks in the Big Game rivalry. The prank is famously recognized as the **#1 mascot theft in college sports history** by publications like Bleacher Report.

**Topic:** Properties
**Lecture References:** Lecture ID: 1_qk0vncag, Key: Fa25-L3a-7.0 (Determine the properties of water at 200 deg. C and 150 kPa)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. ?: N/A

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
Based on this plot, we can see that water is in a superheated vapor state. Since it is in a superheated vapor state, that is why pressure and temperature are independent variables. If it was in the saturated liquid-vapor region, that would not be the case.

#### Solution Code:
```python
## 5. Properties (Code Cell)
T1_C = 200
p1_kPa = 150

# conversion 
p1_MPa = p1_kPa/1000
T1_K = T1_C + 273.15
```
```python
# 6 Calculations (Code Cell)
!pip install pyCalor

from pyCalor import thermo as th
water = th.state('Water', p=(p1_kPa,'kPa'), T=(T1_K,'K'), name="1")
# Here we have used the units 'kPa' and 'K' for pressure and temperature, respectively.
# For pressure you could also use 'Mpa', 'Pa', etc.
# For temperature you could also use 'K'.

# From this state, we can now calculate $s_1$ (kJ/(kg K)), $h_1$ (kJ/kg), and specific volume $v_1$ (m$^3$/kg).
s1 = water.s # kJ/kg*K
h1 = water.h # kJ/kg
v1 = water.v # m3/kg
u1 = water.u # kJ/kg

print('The specific entropy is: {0:1.4f} kJ/kg*K'.format(s1))
print('The specific enthalpy is: {0:1.4f} kJ/kg'.format(h1))
print('The specific volume is: {0:1.4f} m3/kg'.format(v1))
print('The specific internal energy is: {0:1.4f} kJ/kg'.format(u1))

# We can also display this on a plot
water.plot("pv") # supported plots are: "pv","Ts","ph"
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
Based on this plot, we can see that water is in a superheated vapor state. Since it is in a superheated vapor state, that is why pressure and temperature are independent variables. If it was in the saturated liquid-vapor region, that would not be the case.

### PROBLEM: Isentropic and adiabatic steam turbine
**Source:** Jupyter Notebook (turbineSteamIsentropicAdiabatic.ipynb)
**Topic:** Entropy
**Lecture References:** Lecture ID: 1_4ak8fp37, Key: Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Isentropic process: Adiabatic turbine)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 7: Entropy

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
## 1. Problem Statement

Steam enters an adiabatic turbine at $p_1 =$ 5 MPa and $T_1 =$ 450 $^\circ$ C and exits at $p_2 =$ 1.4 MPa. The process is reversible. 

**Goal:** Determine the work output per unit mass, $\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}}{\dot{m}}$.

## 2. Schematic 

Draw a schematic that shows a turbine. Draw the control volume around the turbine. There is a single inlet and oulet for mass to flow in and out. Indicate that it is adiabatic and that work is being transferred out. 

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Control Volume** (mass crosses the boundary).
* Cannot be treated as an ideal gas. We will use pyCalor to determine properties.
* Neglect kinetic and potential energy ($\Delta KE \approx 0$, $\Delta PE \approx 0$).
* **Reversible process**.
* **Adiabatic process**.
* **Steady-flow process** ($\Delta m_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta E_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta S_\text{CV}= 0$).
* We have a single inlet and outlet ($\dot{m}_\text{in}$ and $\dot{m}_\text{out}$).

## 4. Physical Laws
1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dE_\text{CV}}{dt} = \dot{E}_\text{in} - \dot{E}_\text{out}$$

2.  **Conservation of Mass (Mass Balance for a Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dm_\text{CV}}{dt} = \dot{m}_\text{in} - \dot{m}_\text{out}$$

Since this is a steady flow process, we can write:
$$\dot{E}_\text{in} = \dot{E}_\text{out}$$

$$\dot{m}_\text{in} = \dot{m}_\text{out} = \dot{m}$$

We can write our conservation of energy equation as:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{Q}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 + \frac{w_1^2}{2} + g z_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{Q}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 + \frac{w_1^2}{2} + g z_2 \right)$$

Neglecting kinetic and potential energy effects we can write:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{Q}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{Q}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 \right)$$

Applying the adiabatic assumption:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 \right)$$

Rearranging:
$$ \frac{\dot{W}_\text{out} - \dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = h_1 - h_2$$

We expect that work is only transferred out, so $\dot{W}_\text{in} = 0$. We can then write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}}{\dot{m}} = h_1 - h_2$$

We know $h_1$ because we have the properties at state 1. We need additional information in order to determine state 2. Since the turbine is reversible and adiabatic (no heat transfer in), then the process is isentropic. Therefore:

$$s_1 = s_2$$

We can use this information to determine the enthalpy at state 2.
## 7. 💡 Summary and Reasoning

By separating flow work from total work to form the property enthalpy, the work term we calculate is then useful shaft work. The work out per unit mass is a simple formula: 

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}}{\dot{m}} = h_1 - h_2$$

* **Key Insight:** For a steady flow system undergoing an **adiabatic** and **reversible** process, this can be considered as an isentropic process. That is useful because it allows us to determine the exit state of the turbine since we also know the exit pressure.

$$\dot{m}_\text{in} = \dot{m}_\text{out} = \dot{m}$$

We can write our conservation of energy equation as:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{Q}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 + \frac{w_1^2}{2} + g z_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{Q}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 + \frac{w_1^2}{2} + g z_2 \right)$$

Neglecting kinetic and potential energy effects we can write:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{Q}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{Q}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 \right)$$

Applying the adiabatic assumption:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 \right)$$

Rearranging:
$$ \frac{\dot{W}_\text{out} - \dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = h_1 - h_2$$

We expect that work is only transferred out, so $\dot{W}_\text{in} = 0$. We can then write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}}{\dot{m}} = h_1 - h_2$$

We know $h_1$ because we have the properties at state 1. We need additional information in order to determine state 2. Since the turbine is reversible and adiabatic (no heat transfer in), then the process is isentropic. Therefore:

$$s_1 = s_2$$

We can use this information to determine the enthalpy at state 2.
## 7. 💡 Summary and Reasoning

By separating flow work from total work to form the property enthalpy, the work term we calculate is then useful shaft work. The work out per unit mass is a simple formula: 

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}}{\dot{m}} = h_1 - h_2$$

* **Key Insight:** For a steady flow system undergoing an **adiabatic** and **reversible** process, this can be considered as an isentropic process. That is useful because it allows us to determine the exit state of the turbine since we also know the exit pressure.

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
## Introduction to the First Law

Consider a system consisting of a fixed surface $S$ and a weight $\omega$ tied to a drum mounted above the surface in frictionless bearings. 

<img src="fig-1.png" width="300"  alt="Fig. 1">


Let's call the state of this system in which the weight rests upon the surface state 1. 

A process occurs in which some outside agent turns the crank on the drum and causes the weight to move slowly upward until it is elevated a distance $h$ above the surface. This new state of the system is state 2. 

The process just described was accompanied by the flow of work from a system comprising the agent to the system comprising the weight and drum. 

_Work flows from a system (and to another) during a given operation if the sole effect external to the system could be the rise of a weight._

Now the weight-drum system is allowed to return to state 1 by a slow downward movement of the weight. In order to insure slow motion it is necessary to apply a restraining force to the drum. 

<img src="fig-2.png" width="200" alt="Fig. 2">

It is clear that the restraining force might be the force applied by an opposing weight, of the same magnitude as weight $\omega$ but outside the system, which will rise the distance $h$ as the system returns to state 1. 

Following the convention that work done by the system is positive and work done on the system is negative, we may write for the cycle of operations 1-2-1:

$$ \oint dW = 0$$

where the circle on the sign of integration indicates that the summation is made around a close cycle. 

It appears that something which supplied to the system as work in process 1-2 was not destroyed. We cannot say that work was stored in the system at state 2, but we recall that in the science of mechanics that stored something is referred to as potential energy due to gravity. 

Now let us repeat process 1-2 exactly, but, instead of opposing process 2-1 with an external weight, let us restrain the downward motion by means of a brake on the drum. When the weight is once more resting on the surface we inspect the system to see if state 1 has been restored. We find that it has been restored in every respect except one; namely, the temperatures of the drum and brake shoe are higher than in state 1. 

Our experience with heat indicates that even in this respect we may return to state 1 by cooling the brake and rum. Now for this second cycle of operation we may write:

$$ \oint dW \ne 0$$

and our concept of a something which is conserved to appear as work or to be stored as potential energy fails. 

Experiments have shown that the work done in raising the weight is proportional to the heat delivered by the system to the calorimeter. Therefore we may write:


$$ \oint dQ - \oint dW = 0 \tag{1a}$$

## The First Law of Thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamics is simply a generalization of equation (1) to include all cyclic proceesses in nature. 

If any system is carried through a cycle (the end state being precisely the same as the initial state) then the sumation of the work delivered to the surroundings is proportional to the summation of the heat taken from the surroundings. The summations are in both instances algebraic and include positive and negative heat and work. 

These experiments cited above are no proof of the First Law. If it is true it is probable that its truth will never be demonstrated except by failure of all attempts to disprove it.
## Corollaries of the First Law

### Definition of Internal Energy, a Property

<img src="fig-3.png" width="200" alt="Fig. 3">

Consider a system which can change by some process A from state 1 to state 0 and by some process B from state 0 to state 1. Then:

$$\int^0_{1A} (dQ - dW) + \int_{0B}^1(dQ - dW) = 0 $$

Let process $C$ be any other process by which the system may change in state from 0 to 1. Then for the cycle $1A0C1$ we may write:

$$\int^0_{1A} (dQ - dW) + \int_{0C}^1(dQ - dW) = 0 $$

Combining these two equations and simplifying:

$$ \int^1_{0B} (dQ - dW) = \int_{0C}^1 (dQ - dW)$$

Therefore, when a system changes from one prescribed state to another, the value of the integral of $(dQ - dW)$ is fixed by the end states and is independent of the process. It follows that this integral is a property because it satisfies the criterion of a property. We shall call it the internal energy of the system and give it the symbol $E$. Therefore:

$$ E_1 - E_0 = \int_0^1 (dQ - dW) = Q - W \tag{2a}$$

where $Q$ and $W$ denote respectively the net heat received by the system and the net work done by the system during the change of state from 0 to 1. Differentiation gives:

$$dE = dQ - dW $$

Thermodynamics tells us nothing about the values of $E_1$ or $E_0$ in the previous equation though it does tell us the means of computing the difference between them. Since there is no absolute value of the internal energy, it is permissible to assume that its value to be zero at any specified state. 


It is profitable to reflect on the difference between the property $E$ and the non-properties $Q$ and $W$. A cyclic integral of $dQ$ or $dW$ may be other than zero, which is proof that the integrals of these quantities are not properties. On the other hand, the cyclic integral of $dE$ cannot be other than zero.

The differential $dE$ is an exact differential in terms of the variables that determine the state. The value of its integral is fixed when the values of the independent variables are fixed. Nos imilar statement can be made for $dQ$ and $dW$, because the values of their integrals depend on the processes by which the state is approached and not upon the magnitudes of the properties corresponding to the state. 

So we can write $E_1$ to denote the internal energy corresponding to a state 1 but not $W_1$ or $Q_1$, because there is no quantity of work or heat which corresponds to state 1. 

### The law of conservation of energy

The internal energy of a system remains unchanged if the system is isolated from its environment as regards work and heat, regardless of the nature of the changes within the system. 

Internal energy remains unchanged for any cyclic change in the state of the system. This is equivalent to the First Law. 

### The definition of energy

The term energy may be employed as a general term which embraces heat, work, and internal energy. 

In Mechanics changes in internal energy of a system is called kinetic energy. 

A system comprising a weight in a gravitational field, work may be introduced to raise the weight. The corresponding icnrease in the internal energy of the system is called in mechanics the increase in potential energy due to gravity. 

Internal energy may include potential energy in an electrostatic field or in a magnetic field. These are all forms of stored energy which may be increased or decreased through the transfer of work alone. Internal energy includes besides these all kinds of stored energy which are affected by transfer of heat. 

## The First Law and the Boundaries of a System

The first law states that work and heat are equal in a cyclic process. Work and heat are evaluated at the boundaries of a system. No application of the first law can be made until the system and its boundaries are defined. The boundaries need not be stationary, and in general they will not be. 

*The first step in the solution of a problem in thermodynamics is the description of a system and its boundaries.*

If any system is carried through a cycle (the end state being precisely the same as the initial state) then the sumation of the work delivered to the surroundings is proportional to the summation of the heat taken from the surroundings. The summations are in both instances algebraic and include positive and negative heat and work. 

These experiments cited above are no proof of the First Law. If it is true it is probable that its truth will never be demonstrated except by failure of all attempts to disprove it.
## Corollaries of the First Law

### Definition of Internal Energy, a Property

<img src="fig-3.png" width="200" alt="Fig. 3">

Consider a system which can change by some process A from state 1 to state 0 and by some process B from state 0 to state 1. Then:

$$\int^0_{1A} (dQ - dW) + \int_{0B}^1(dQ - dW) = 0 $$

Let process $C$ be any other process by which the system may change in state from 0 to 1. Then for the cycle $1A0C1$ we may write:

$$\int^0_{1A} (dQ - dW) + \int_{0C}^1(dQ - dW) = 0 $$

Combining these two equations and simplifying:

$$ \int^1_{0B} (dQ - dW) = \int_{0C}^1 (dQ - dW)$$

Therefore, when a system changes from one prescribed state to another, the value of the integral of $(dQ - dW)$ is fixed by the end states and is independent of the process. It follows that this integral is a property because it satisfies the criterion of a property. We shall call it the internal energy of the system and give it the symbol $E$. Therefore:

$$ E_1 - E_0 = \int_0^1 (dQ - dW) = Q - W \tag{2a}$$

where $Q$ and $W$ denote respectively the net heat received by the system and the net work done by the system during the change of state from 0 to 1. Differentiation gives:

$$dE = dQ - dW $$

Thermodynamics tells us nothing about the values of $E_1$ or $E_0$ in the previous equation though it does tell us the means of computing the difference between them. Since there is no absolute value of the internal energy, it is permissible to assume that its value to be zero at any specified state. 


It is profitable to reflect on the difference between the property $E$ and the non-properties $Q$ and $W$. A cyclic integral of $dQ$ or $dW$ may be other than zero, which is proof that the integrals of these quantities are not properties. On the other hand, the cyclic integral of $dE$ cannot be other than zero.

The differential $dE$ is an exact differential in terms of the variables that determine the state. The value of its integral is fixed when the values of the independent variables are fixed. Nos imilar statement can be made for $dQ$ and $dW$, because the values of their integrals depend on the processes by which the state is approached and not upon the magnitudes of the properties corresponding to the state. 

So we can write $E_1$ to denote the internal energy corresponding to a state 1 but not $W_1$ or $Q_1$, because there is no quantity of work or heat which corresponds to state 1. 

### The law of conservation of energy

The internal energy of a system remains unchanged if the system is isolated from its environment as regards work and heat, regardless of the nature of the changes within the system. 

Internal energy remains unchanged for any cyclic change in the state of the system. This is equivalent to the First Law. 

### The definition of energy

The term energy may be employed as a general term which embraces heat, work, and internal energy. 

In Mechanics changes in internal energy of a system is called kinetic energy. 

A system comprising a weight in a gravitational field, work may be introduced to raise the weight. The corresponding icnrease in the internal energy of the system is called in mechanics the increase in potential energy due to gravity. 

Internal energy may include potential energy in an electrostatic field or in a magnetic field. These are all forms of stored energy which may be increased or decreased through the transfer of work alone. Internal energy includes besides these all kinds of stored energy which are affected by transfer of heat. 

## The First Law and the Boundaries of a System

The first law states that work and heat are equal in a cyclic process. Work and heat are evaluated at the boundaries of a system. No application of the first law can be made until the system and its boundaries are defined. The boundaries need not be stationary, and in general they will not be. 

*The first step in the solution of a problem in thermodynamics is the description of a system and its boundaries.*

**Lecture References:** 
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 3: Properties of Pure Substances

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
Instead of using the "tables" in the back of your textbook to determine thermodynamic properties, here we will use a Python module called [`pyCalor`](https://pypi.org/project/pyCalor/).

This Python module was developed in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. It is used for teaching undergraduate thermodynamics (ME40).

The software package contains classes `state` and `process`. The following is the description of their use. You can also get the built-in information by typing the following statements in the Python command line:  

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`print(th.state.__doc__)`   

`print(th.process.__doc__)`
## Class **state**  

A call

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`st = th.state(substance, property1=value1, property2=value2, name="A")`  

creates an object of class `state`. Each such object contains the following fields:  


| - | name | description |
| :-----------: | :--------------: | :-------------------------: |
| `st.p` | pressure | (in units of kPa)  |
| `st.t` | temperature | (in units of K)  |
| `st.v` | specific volume | (in units of m3/kg)  |
| `st.u` | specific energy | (in units of kJ/kg)  |
| `st.h` | specific enthalpy | (in units of kJ/kg)  |
| `st.s` | specific entropy | (in units of kJ/kg K)  |
| `st.x` | quality | (fraction)  |
| `st.molW` | molecular weight | (in units of kg/kmol)  |
| `st.R` | gas constant | (in units of kJ/kg K)  |
| `st.substance` | 'water', 'air', 'nitrogen', ... | ()  |

The property values are in the “base units”; they can be viewed by issuing a command:

`state.units`

Examples:
This information can also be viewed in the programming environment; 

`th.state.__doc__`

#### Solution Code:
```python
!pip install pyCalor
```
```python
from pyCalor import thermo as th
```
```python
print(th.state.__doc__)
```
```python
print(th.process.__doc__)
```
```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
```python
th.state.units
```
```python
st1 = th.state('water', p=(1,'bar'), v=0.1, name="1")
# st1.substance
# print(dir(st1))
# st1.fluidName
# st1.fluidSet
```
```python
st1.plot("pv") # supported plots are: "pv","Ts","ph"
```
```python
st2 = th.state('R134a', x=1, t=300, name="B")
st2.plot("Ts", isoProp="v")
```
```python
st3 = th.state('air', p=(1,'Mpa'), t=(10,'c'))
st3.name = "2a"
```
```python
print(th.state.__doc__)
```
```python
st1 = th.state('water', p=( 1,'bar'), x=0, name="A")
st2 = th.state('water', p=(20,'bar'), s=st1.s,name="B")
st3 = th.state('water', p=(20,'bar'), x=1,name="C")
st4 = th.state('water', p=( 1,'bar'), s=st3.s, name="D")
pr = th.process([(st1,st2),(st2,st3),(st3,st4),(st4,st1)])
pr.plot("pv")
```
```python
plt.figure
sub = 'air'
st5 = th.state(sub, p=(1,'bar'), t=300, name="1")
st6 = th.state(sub, p=(2,'Mpa'), s=st5.s, name="2")
st7 = th.state(sub, p=(2,'Mpa'), t=1600, name="3")
st8 = th.state(sub, p=(1,'bar'), s=st7.s)
st8.name = "4"
pr = th.process([st5, st6, st7, st8, st5])
pr.plot("ts")
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
This information can also be viewed in the programming environment; 

`th.state.__doc__`
## Class process

A call

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`pr = th.process([(state1,state2),(state2,state3),...])`

creates an object of class process. An object of this class represent a simple process, from `st1` to `st2`,

`pr = th.process(st1,st2)`

a simple cyclic process,

`pr = th.process([(st1,st2),(st2,st3),(st3,st4),(st4,st1)])`,

which can also be created as 

`pr = th.process(st1,st2,st3,st4,st1)`,

or any complex process, but for a single working fluid.  

You can access process object properties by the following calls

|  |  description |
| :----------- | :--------------: |
| `pr.StateList` | returns a list of `state` objects| 
| `pr.isoProp(st1,st2)` | returns a dictionary of `{isoProperty: value,...}` for process `st1` &rarr; `st2` |

Once you created process object `pr`, you can display its states on a thermodynamic diagram via  

`pr.plot('ts')`   

to display process `pr` on a *T-s* diagram; you may likewise to make such plot in other coordinates, like `'pv'`, `'ph'`, etc.

**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 4: Energy Analysis of Closed Systems

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
## Reasoning
We were able to prove that $p V^{\kappa} = \text{constant}$ for an adiabatic expansion process. We also see from this that we are able to relate pressure to volume for a process from A to B. That means we will be able to determine the boundary work done for such a process. This will be useful when we start to analyze cycles, such as the Carnot cycle, which has adiabatic expansion and compression processes.

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## Reasoning
We were able to prove that $p V^{\kappa} = \text{constant}$ for an adiabatic expansion process. We also see from this that we are able to relate pressure to volume for a process from A to B. That means we will be able to determine the boundary work done for such a process. This will be useful when we start to analyze cycles, such as the Carnot cycle, which has adiabatic expansion and compression processes.

### PROBLEM: Differential Entropy Relations
**Source:** Jupyter Notebook (entropyDifferentialRelations.ipynb)
**Topic:** Entropy
**Lecture References:** Key: Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Differential entropy change relations)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 7: Entropy

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
## 1. Problem Statement

Derive the differential entropy change relations.  

**Goal:** For an ideal gas, show that for an isentropic process, we can relate temperature, pressure, and specific volume between two states by knowing specific heats.

## 2. Schematic 

None.

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Internally reversible process** $\left( \frac{\delta Q}{T} \right)_\text{int,rev} = dS$. An internally reversible process is one where all irreversibilities, e.g., friction, temperature differences, etc., occur outside the system's boundaries. Inside the system, the process occurs without any dissipation, maintaining equilibrium and a uniform temperature.
* The only kind of work a simple compressible system may undergo in an internally reversible process is boundary work.
* Constant specific heats.

## 4. Physical Laws
1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Closed System):**
    $$dU = \delta Q_\text{int,rev} - \delta W_\text{int,rev}$$

We can write this as:

$$dU = TdS - pdV$$

$$\implies TdS = dU + pdV$$

We call this the $TdS$ or Gibbs equation. We can also write this as:
$$Tds = du + pdv$$

Recalling the definition of enthalpy $h = u + pv$, we can write it in differential form:

$$dh = du + p dv + v dp $$

or 

$$du = dh - p dv - v dp$$

Substituting into the $Tds$ equation:

$$Tds = \left( dh - p dv - v dp \right) + pdv$$

Simplifying:

$$Tds = dh  - v dp$$

So changes in entropy can be related to other properties:

$$ds = \frac{dh}{T}  - \frac{v dp}{T} \tag{1}$$

For an ideal gas we can recall that $dh = c_p dT$ and $p v = R T$. We can write the ideal gas equation as:

$$v = R T / p$$

Substituting that and $dh = c_p dT$ into equation (1):

$$ds = \frac{c_p dT}{T}  - \frac{(R T / p) dp}{T}$$

Simplifying:

$$ds = \frac{c_p dT}{T}  - \frac{R dp}{p}$$

Integrating from state 1 to state 2:

$$\int_1^2ds = \int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{c_p dT}{T}  - R \int_{p_1}^{p_2}\frac{dp}{p}$$

Assuming constant specific heats:

$$\int_1^2ds = c_p \int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{dT}{T}  - R \int_{p_1}^{p_2}\frac{dp}{p}$$

Then we have:

$$s_2 - s_1 = c_p \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} - R \ln \frac{p_2}{p_1} \tag{2}$$

For an ideal gas we can recall that $du = c_v dT$ and $p = R T / v$. Substituting yields:

$$Tds = \left( c_v dT \right) + \left(R T / v \right)dv$$

Rearranging:
$$ds = \left( \frac{c_v dT}{T} \right) + \left(\frac{R}{v} \right)dv$$

Integrating:
$$\int_1^2ds = \int_1^2\frac{c_v dT}{T} + \int_1^2\frac{R}{v} dv$$

Assuming constant specific heats:
$$s_2 - s_1 = c_v \int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{dT}{T} + R\int_{v_1}^{v_2}\frac{dv}{v}$$

$$s_2 - s_1 = c_v \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} + R \ln \frac{v_2}{v_1} \tag{3}$$

If isentropic and constant specific heats, we can write equation (2) and (3) as:       

$$0 = c_p \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} - R \ln \frac{p_2}{p_1}$$
             
$$0 = c_v \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} + R \ln \frac{v_2}{v_1}$$

We can rearrange these as:

$$\ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \ln \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{R}{c_p}}$$
             
$$ \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \ln \left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\frac{R}{c_v}}$$

Simplifying:

$$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{R}{c_p}}$$
             
$$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\frac{R}{c_v}}$$

Recalling that $k = c_p/c_v$ and $R = c_p - c_v$, we can write:

$$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{c_p - c_v}{c_p}}$$
             
$$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\frac{c_p - c_v}{c_v}}$$

Rearranging:

$$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{[k/k - (1/k)]} = \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{(k-1)/k} \tag{ideal gas, s = const}$$
             
$$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \left(\frac{v_1}{v_2}\right)^{k - 1} \tag{ideal gas, s = const}$$

We can set these two equations equal to each other to get our third isentropic relation:

$$\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{(k-1)/k} = \left(\frac{v_1}{v_2}\right)^{k - 1} $$

Which we can re-write as:

$$\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right) = \left(\frac{v_1}{v_2}\right)^{k} \tag{ideal gas, s = const} $$

We can write these three ideal gas isentropic relations more generally as:

$$T v^{k - 1} = \text{const} $$
$$T p^{(1 - k)/k} = \text{const} $$
$$p v ^k = \text{const} $$

where $k = k(T)$.

$$du = dh - p dv - v dp$$

Substituting into the $Tds$ equation:

Simplifying:

$$Tds = dh  - v dp$$

So changes in entropy can be related to other properties:

$$ds = \frac{dh}{T}  - \frac{v dp}{T} \tag{1}$$

For an ideal gas we can recall that $dh = c_p dT$ and $p v = R T$. We can write the ideal gas equation as:

$$v = R T / p$$

Substituting that and $dh = c_p dT$ into equation (1):

$$ds = \frac{c_p dT}{T}  - \frac{(R T / p) dp}{T}$$

Simplifying:

$$ds = \frac{c_p dT}{T}  - \frac{R dp}{p}$$

Integrating from state 1 to state 2:

$$\int_1^2ds = \int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{c_p dT}{T}  - R \int_{p_1}^{p_2}\frac{dp}{p}$$

Assuming constant specific heats:

$$\int_1^2ds = c_p \int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{dT}{T}  - R \int_{p_1}^{p_2}\frac{dp}{p}$$

Then we have:

$$s_2 - s_1 = c_p \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} - R \ln \frac{p_2}{p_1} \tag{2}$$

For an ideal gas we can recall that $du = c_v dT$ and $p = R T / v$. Substituting yields:

$$Tds = \left( c_v dT \right) + \left(R T / v \right)dv$$

Rearranging:
$$ds = \left( \frac{c_v dT}{T} \right) + \left(\frac{R}{v} \right)dv$$

Integrating:
$$\int_1^2ds = \int_1^2\frac{c_v dT}{T} + \int_1^2\frac{R}{v} dv$$

Assuming constant specific heats:
$$s_2 - s_1 = c_v \int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{dT}{T} + R\int_{v_1}^{v_2}\frac{dv}{v}$$

$$s_2 - s_1 = c_v \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} + R \ln \frac{v_2}{v_1} \tag{3}$$

If isentropic and constant specific heats, we can write equation (2) and (3) as:       

$$0 = c_p \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} - R \ln \frac{p_2}{p_1}$$
             
$$0 = c_v \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} + R \ln \frac{v_2}{v_1}$$

We can rearrange these as:

$$\ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \ln \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{R}{c_p}}$$
             
$$ \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \ln \left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\frac{R}{c_v}}$$

$$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} =  \left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\frac{R}{c_v}}$$

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:

### PROBLEM: Isentropic nitrogen compressor
**Source:** Jupyter Notebook (compressorAdiabaticNitrogen.ipynb)
**Topic:** Entropy
**Lecture References:** Lecture ID: 1_4ak8fp37, Key: Fa25-L7c-5.0 (Air property tables: Compressor example)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 7: Entropy

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
## 1. Problem Statement
Nitrogen enters an adiabatic compressor at $p_1 =$ 110 kPa and $T_1 =$ 30 $^\circ$ C and exits at $p_2 =$ 682 kPa. The process is reversible. 

**Goal:** Determine the work input per unit mass, $\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}}$.

## 2. Schematic 

Draw a schematic that shows a compressor. Draw the control volume around the compressor. There is a single inlet and oulet for mass to flow in and out. Indicate that it is adiabatic and that work is being transferred in. 

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Control Volume** (mass crosses the boundary).
* Nitrogen can be treated as an ideal gas. So we can use $T dS$ relations assuming constant specific heats. We can also use pyCalor to determine properties. We will do both and compare our answers.
* Neglect kinetic and potential energy ($\Delta KE \approx 0$, $\Delta PE \approx 0$).
* **Reversible process**.
* **Adiabatic process**.
* **Steady-flow process** ($\Delta m_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta E_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta S_\text{CV}= 0$).
* We have a single inlet and outlet ($\dot{m}_\text{in}$ and $\dot{m}_\text{out}$).

## 4. Physical Laws
1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dE_\text{CV}}{dt} = \dot{E}_\text{in} - \dot{E}_\text{out}$$

2.  **Conservation of Mass (Mass Balance for a Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dm_\text{CV}}{dt} = \dot{m}_\text{in} - \dot{m}_\text{out}$$

Since this is a steady flow process, we can write:
$$\dot{E}_\text{in} = \dot{E}_\text{out}$$

$$\dot{m}_\text{in} = \dot{m}_\text{out} = \dot{m}$$

We can write our conservation of energy equation as:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{Q}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 + \frac{w_1^2}{2} + g z_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{Q}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 + \frac{w_1^2}{2} + g z_2 \right)$$

Neglecting kinetic and potential energy effects we can write:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{Q}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{Q}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 \right)$$

Applying the adiabatic assumption:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 \right)$$

Rearranging:
$$ \frac{\dot{W}_\text{out} - \dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = h_1 - h_2$$

We expect that work is only transferred out, so $\dot{W}_\text{out} = 0$. We can then write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = h_2 - h_1$$

We know $h_1$ because we have the properties at state 1. We need additional information in order to determine state 2. Since the compressor is reversible and adiabatic (no heat transfer in), then the process is isentropic. Therefore:

$$s_2 = s_1$$

We can use this information to determine the enthalpy at state 2. 

### Alternative solution

We can determine the temperature at state 2 by using the $TdS$ relations. For an ideal gas undergoing an isentropic (reversible and adiabatic) process, we can write:

$$\left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)_{s = const} = \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{(k-1)/k} $$

Recall that $k = c_p/c_v$, so to do this calculation we have to select the $k$ at some temperature. We can choose the temperature at the inlet state. By knowing $T_1$, $p_1$, and $p_2$, we can determine $T_2$. 

For an ideal gas, changes in enthalpy can be expressed as:

$$h_2 - h_1 = c_p \left(T_2 - T_1 \right) $$

Again, we have to select a specific heat at some temperature. We can take the inlet temperature.
## 7. 💡 Summary and Reasoning

By separating flow work from total work to form the property enthalpy, the work term we calculate is then useful shaft work. The work out per unit mass is a simple formula: 

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = h_2 - h_1$$

* **Key Insight:** For a steady flow system undergoing an **adiabatic** and **reversible** process, this can be considered as an isentropic process. That is useful because it allows us to determine the exit state of the turbine since we also know the exit pressure. 

* **Alternative Solution** If we assume ideal gas behavior, and if the process is isentropic (reversible and adiabatic) then we can write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = c_p \left( T_2 - T_1 \right)$$

For that we have to select specific heats at a certain temperature. We chose the inlet temperature. That turned out to be a good assumption. This approach is simpler and is a good way to first solve the problem. One can check if it is a good assumption by determining actual property values using `pyCalor`.

#### Solution Code:

Since this is a steady flow process, we can write:

$$\dot{m}_\text{in} = \dot{m}_\text{out} = \dot{m}$$

We can write our conservation of energy equation as:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{Q}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 + \frac{w_1^2}{2} + g z_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{Q}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 + \frac{w_1^2}{2} + g z_2 \right)$$

Applying the adiabatic assumption:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in} + \dot{m} \left(h_1 \right) = \dot{W}_\text{out} + \dot{m} \left(h_2 \right)$$

Rearranging:
$$ \frac{\dot{W}_\text{out} - \dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = h_1 - h_2$$

We expect that work is only transferred out, so $\dot{W}_\text{out} = 0$. We can then write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = h_2 - h_1$$

We know $h_1$ because we have the properties at state 1. We need additional information in order to determine state 2. Since the compressor is reversible and adiabatic (no heat transfer in), then the process is isentropic. Therefore:

$$s_2 = s_1$$

We can use this information to determine the enthalpy at state 2. 

### Alternative solution

We can determine the temperature at state 2 by using the $TdS$ relations. For an ideal gas undergoing an isentropic (reversible and adiabatic) process, we can write:

$$\left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)_{s = const} = \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{(k-1)/k} $$

Recall that $k = c_p/c_v$, so to do this calculation we have to select the $k$ at some temperature. We can choose the temperature at the inlet state. By knowing $T_1$, $p_1$, and $p_2$, we can determine $T_2$. 

For an ideal gas, changes in enthalpy can be expressed as:

$$h_2 - h_1 = c_p \left(T_2 - T_1 \right) $$

Again, we have to select a specific heat at some temperature. We can take the inlet temperature.
## 7. 💡 Summary and Reasoning

By separating flow work from total work to form the property enthalpy, the work term we calculate is then useful shaft work. The work out per unit mass is a simple formula: 

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = h_2 - h_1$$

* **Key Insight:** For a steady flow system undergoing an **adiabatic** and **reversible** process, this can be considered as an isentropic process. That is useful because it allows us to determine the exit state of the turbine since we also know the exit pressure. 

* **Alternative Solution** If we assume ideal gas behavior, and if the process is isentropic (reversible and adiabatic) then we can write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}} = c_p \left( T_2 - T_1 \right)$$

For that we have to select specific heats at a certain temperature. We chose the inlet temperature. That turned out to be a good assumption. This approach is simpler and is a good way to first solve the problem. One can check if it is a good assumption by determining actual property values using `pyCalor`.

### PROBLEM: The Pure Substance
**Source:** Jupyter Notebook (propertiesIndependentDependent.ipynb)
**Topic:** Properties
**Lecture References:** Lecture ID: 1_r5zqwxag, Key: Fa25-L1b-5.0 (Independent and Dependent Properties)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 3: Properties of Pure Substances

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
Any change in the property $P$ may be expressed in terms of its partial derivatives and the changes in the independent properties; thus:

$$dP = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_1}dx_1 + \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_2}dx_2 + ... \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_n}dx_n$$

Consider a system having two independent properties, $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then the differential of the dependent property $P$ is given by:

$$dP = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_1}dx_1 + \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_2}dx_2 $$

Partial-differential calculus teaches that if $P$ is a function of $x_1$ and $x_2$ then the magnitude of the second derivative of $P$ with respect to $x_1$ and $x_2$ is independent of the order of differentation:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2} \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_1}\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_2}\right) $$

If we have an expression of the form:

$$dP = M dx_1 + N dx_2 $$

Then

$$\frac{\partial M}{\partial x_2} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x_1}  $$

provided that $P$ is a property of the system. This is another way that a property may be identified.
## The Pure Substance

A system which is homogeneous in composition and homogeneous and invariable in chemical aggregation is called a pure substance. For example, a system consisting of pure oxygen existing as a vapor, a liquid, a solid, or any combination of these is a pure substance. 

The same can be said as regard ordinary water. Air may be consideered a pure substance as long as it is all vapor or all liquid. However, if part is a liquid and part vapor, then it is no longer a pure substance, for the liquid will be richer in nitrogen than the vapor. Again, a mixture of one mole of hydrogen gas and one-half mole of oxygen gas is a pure substance as long as no liquid or solid phase appears. On the other hand, if one part of the system the constituents are combined chemically in the form H2O, the system is not a pure substance because though homogeneous in composition it is not homogeneous in chemical aggregation. If the entire system changes in the course of a process to form H2O, it would not be considered a pure substance during that process because it is not invariable in chemical aggregation. 

_It is known from experience that a pure substance in the absence of motion, gravity, capillarity, electricity, and magnetism has only two independent properties._ Among the familiar properties of a pure substance which can be quantitatively evaluated are pressure, temperature, specific volume, internal energy, viscosity, and electrical resistivity. Among these we may select two, and if these two prove to be independent of each other, then when their values are fixed the values of all the others are fixed. Most of the time, any two properties will be indepedent of each other. Exceptions are specific volume and density. A less obvious exception is the combination of pressure and temperature — these properties are independent of each other for pure substances in the vapor phase or in the liquid phase, but not for a mixture of phases.
## The symbols $e$, $u$, $E$, and $U$

A system consisting of a pure substance in a homogeneous and stable state has two independent properties in the absence of motion, gravity, electricity, magnetism, and capillarity. Therefore, we may state that the internal energy of a 1-kg mass of such a system is a fucntion, for example, of temperature and volume of the unit mass. To this function we shall give the symbol $u$, whereas the symbol $e$ may be used to denote the internal energy of a unit system in general. Thsu, for the conditions specified, we may write:

$$e =u(T,v) $$

or simply

$$ e = u$$

Values of the function $u$ may be arranged in a table according to values of two arguments, such as temperature and specific volume, or temperature and pressure. Values of $e$ could not be arranged in such a sinmple table because $e$ changes not only with changes in temperature and specific volume, but also with changes in motion, height, electrostatic charge, position in an electrostatic field, etc. Therefore, we distinguish between $u$, the function of two variables, and $e$, the function of many variables. We will use the capital letters $U$ and $E$ to denote the corresponding quantities for systems that are not of a unit mass. Thus, 

$$U = \int u dm \text{ and } E = \int e dm$$

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
### Work Done on a Piston

If a fluid is confined within a cylinder by a piston, work will be done by the fluid if the piston is allowed to move outward. For any small expansion, the work is given by:

$$p A ds = p dV $$

where $A$ denotes the area of the piston and $ds$ the distance through which the piston moves. So the total work of a piston is:

$$W = \int p dV $$

However, work and the integral of $p dV$ are not always equal or equivalent and great care must be exercised in making the substitution. The experiment with multiple partitions (constant energy and constant temperature) both have finite values of the integral of $pdV$ and zero values of work. In the paddle-wheel experiment at constant volume the integral of $p dV$ is zero and the work done by the system is less than zero. 

_The substitution of $p dV$ for $dW$ can be made only if all the work involved in the process is done by the fluid on a moving boundary on which it exerts at all times the same pressure that it exerts on its stationary boundaries._
### Adiabatic Process

A process which involves no exchange of heat is called an adiabatic process. The process at constant internal energy in which the partition is withdrawn is an adiabatic process. One simple adiabatic process consists of a slow expansion or compression of a fluid behind a piston. The piston and cylinder walls are perfect thermal insulators. For this process we can write from the First Law:

$$ 0 = m du + dW$$

Here we can substitute $pdV$ for $dW$ and obtain:

$$ du = -p dv $$

The path of this type of exapnsion can be traced on a digram of properties of the fulid provided that the relation between $p$, $v$, and $u$ is known for the fluid in the cylinder. 

We can write the above as: 

$$\frac{du}{dv} = -p $$

So if the initial state is represented by a point $P$ in the $u-v$ diagram of Fig. 9, the initial slope on the diagram is equal to the negative of pressure. The curve may be approximated by following this slope for a short distance to $Q$ where the corresponding pressure may be determined from $U$, $v$, and the known relation, and a new slope may be determined. A second step to $R$ and so on and so forth. 

<img src="fig-9.png" width="200"  alt="Fig. 9">

If the relation between $u$, $p$, and $v$ is algebaric, then it is possible that a complete algebraic statement exists for the relation between any two properties, e.g., $p$ and $v$, for this type of adiabatic expansion. The $u - p - v$ relation for some gases can be represented by an equation of the form:

$$ u = A + B p v$$

where $A$ and $B$ are constants.

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
## 3. ⚖️ Physical Laws and Governing Equations

### Process: Compress Gas

Reversible process:

Consider a piston whose piston head area is, $S$. The piston head is displaced, compressing the gas inside of it. That gas inside is at a pressure, $p$. 

The force applied to the piston head is:

$$F = p S $$

If we shift the piston a distance, $dh$, an amount of work $dW$ is done:

$$dW = p S dh $$

$$W = \int_A^B p dV $$

Let's analyze the isothermal compression of an ideal gas in a piston. 

$$dU = \delta Q - \delta W $$

$$ W = \int_A^B p dV $$

We know from the ideal gas law that:

$$p V = m R T$$

which we can re-write as:

$$p = \frac{m R T}{V} $$

Therefore, we have:

$$ W = \int_A^B \frac{m R T}{V} dV $$

Since $T$ is constant and it is a closed system (no mass transfer), we have:

$$ W = m R T \int_A^B \frac{1}{V} dV $$

$$ W = m R T \ln \frac{V_A}{V_B} $$
## 7. 💡 Summary and Reasoning
If the state of the system can be represented on a $(p,V)$ diagram, the work performed during a transformation has a simple geometric representation. 

Transformations which are especially important are those for which the initial and final states are the same. these are called cyclical transformations or cycles. A cycle, therefore is a transformation which brings the system back to its initial state. If the state of the system can be represented on a volume pressure diagram then a cycle can be represented on this diagram by a closed curve, such as the curve, 1234.

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 3. ⚖️ Physical Laws and Governing Equations

### Process: Compress Gas

Reversible process:

Consider a piston whose piston head area is, $S$. The piston head is displaced, compressing the gas inside of it. That gas inside is at a pressure, $p$. 

The force applied to the piston head is:

$$F = p S $$

If we shift the piston a distance, $dh$, an amount of work $dW$ is done:

$$dW = p S dh $$

$$W = \int_A^B p dV $$

Let's analyze the isothermal compression of an ideal gas in a piston. 

$$dU = \delta Q - \delta W $$

$$ W = \int_A^B p dV $$

We know from the ideal gas law that:

$$p V = m R T$$

which we can re-write as:

$$p = \frac{m R T}{V} $$

Therefore, we have:

$$ W = \int_A^B \frac{m R T}{V} dV $$

Since $T$ is constant and it is a closed system (no mass transfer), we have:

$$ W = m R T \int_A^B \frac{1}{V} dV $$

$$ W = m R T \ln \frac{V_A}{V_B} $$
## 7. 💡 Summary and Reasoning
If the state of the system can be represented on a $(p,V)$ diagram, the work performed during a transformation has a simple geometric representation. 

Transformations which are especially important are those for which the initial and final states are the same. these are called cyclical transformations or cycles. A cycle, therefore is a transformation which brings the system back to its initial state. If the state of the system can be represented on a volume pressure diagram then a cycle can be represented on this diagram by a closed curve, such as the curve, 1234.

**Topic:** Closed Systems
**Lecture References:** Lecture ID: 1_fclugwz7, Key: Fa25-L4a-4.0 (Moving boundary polytropic processes)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 4: Energy Analysis of Closed Systems

#### Discussion / Problem Statement:
## Reasoning
### For the isothermal expansion
We see that as the volume increases, the pressure decreases as $1/V$, which is what we would expect from the ideal gas law. We also see from this that we are able to relate pressure to volume for this process. That means we will be able to determine the boundary work done for such a process. This will be useful when we start to analyze cycles, such as the Carnot cycle, which has isothermal expansion and compression processes. We also see that the boundary work done in expansion is positive, which is what we expected. 

### For the isobaric expansion
We see that the work transferred out for the isobaric expansion process is larger than the isothermal, which is what we would expect since the area under the pressure-volume curve is higher for the isobaric vs. the isothermal.

**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass that does not cross the boundary), the **First Law of Thermodynamics** states that the only two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. This is the fundamental definition of a closed system. The **direction of heat transfer** is determined *only* by the **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)**, moving from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. Conversely, **work** is any energy transfer mechanism *other than* heat.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Terminology
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-8.0 (Time: 20:03 - 21:05)
**Content Summary:**
An **adiabatic process** is one in which there is absolutely **no heat transfer** ($Q=0$). This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer by work to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-9.0 (Time: 21:06 - 29:42)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-10.0 (Time: 29:43 - 32:59)
**Content Summary:**
The section summarizes the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a **closed system** as $\\Delta U = Q_{in} - W_{out}$. This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\\Delta U = Q$.

The problem involves **shaft work input** ($W_{in}$) from a paddle wheel and **heat output** ($Q_{out}$) to the surroundings. The change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) is calculated using the form $\\mathbf{U_2 - U_1 = W_{in} - Q_{out}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Mechanisms of Energy Transfer For a Closed System
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-12.0 (Time: 43:07 - 46:19)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\mathbf{\\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$). This emphasizes that work and heat are **path functions**, while internal energy is a **property** (state function).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Introduction to Entropy ($S$).
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-1.0 (Time: 00:00 - 04:06)
**Content Summary:**
The lecture begins by introducing the concept of \textbf{entropy} ($S$) and its utility in \textbf{isentropic processes}. The instructor notes that entropy is a "weird thing" that cannot be directly measured. The \textbf{Temperature-Entropy (TS) diagram} is introduced as a more useful tool than the Pressure-Volume (PV) diagram for analyzing \textbf{power cycles}. The four-step \textbf{Carnot cycle} (two isothermal, two isentropic processes) is illustrated on the TS diagram, where the area enclosed represents the \textbf{net heat in} (which equals the \textbf{net work out}) for the cycle. Entropy is presented as a helpful "compass" to guide process analysis and determine power output.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Change in Entropy in Thermal Conduction
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-2.0 (Time: 04:07 - 18:07)
**Content Summary:**
This segment analyzes the \textbf{change in entropy} during \textbf{thermal conduction} between two \textbf{thermal reservoirs} (one hot, $T_1$, one cold, $T_2$) that transfer a heat magnitude $Q$. The fundamental equation for change in entropy is introduced: $\mathbf{dS = \delta Q/T}$. The units for entropy ($S$) are $\text{kJ}/\text{K}$ and specific entropy ($s$) are $\text{kJ}/(\text{kg}\cdot \text{K})$. The change in entropy for each control volume (CV) is calculated: $\Delta S_1 = -Q/T_1$ (entropy decreases for the hot reservoir) and $\Delta S_2 = +Q/T_2$ (entropy increases for the cold reservoir). The \textbf{total entropy change of the system} is derived as $\mathbf{\Delta S_{\text{total}} = Q(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}$. The condition for a \textbf{reversible process} is defined as $\Delta S_{\text{total}} = 0$, which would only occur if $T_1 = T_2$. Since $T_1 > T_2$, the key takeaway is that the entropy of an isolated system must either remain constant (reversible) or \textbf{increase} (irreversible/spontaneous heat flow), confirming the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-3.0 (Time: 18:08 - 19:52)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a conceptual transition, reminding the class that \textbf{entropy ($S$) is a thermodynamic property} like internal energy ($U$) or enthalpy ($H$). For a pure substance, determining two independent properties provides complete information, including the value of specific entropy ($s$). The instructor reinforces the importance of \textbf{TS (Temperature-Entropy) diagrams} for analyzing power and gas cycles and emphasizes that entropy is \textbf{not a path function}. The discussion concludes with a reflection on the formula $\mathbf{dS = \delta Q / T}$, which implies that energy has a "value" or "quality" (the essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Example: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-4.0 (Time: 19:53 - 35:06)
**Content Summary:**
The segment begins a detailed \textbf{example problem} to calculate the entropy change for \textbf{pure water} in an \textbf{isobaric (constant pressure)} process within a piston-cylinder device. The process is depicted on a TS diagram, starting at State 1 as a \textbf{compressed liquid} ($P_1 = 140 \text{ kPa}$, $T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C}$) and moving toward a superheated vapor state. The instructor first determines the initial properties, including $s_1$ and $h_1$. A \textbf{First Law energy balance} is applied to the closed system (piston-cylinder): $\mathbf{\Delta U = Q_{\text{in}} - W_{\text{out}}}$ (neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy). The \textbf{work out} is calculated for the constant pressure process as $W_{\text{out}} = P(V_2 - V_1)$ or $m P(v_2 - v_1)$. By manipulating the energy balance, the relationship $\mathbf{Q_{\text{in}} = \Delta H}$ (change in enthalpy) is established, which simplifies the analysis. The video captions end mid-solution.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Challenges in decarbonizing
**Source:** Class plan and rules; Challenges in Decarbonizing our Energy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1a-5.0 (Time: 06:51 - 15:00)
**Content Summary:**
The discussion on decarbonization begins with a comparison of CO2 emissions versus national wealth for major global markets (US, China, Germany), highlighting the US as a key focus for mechanical engineers. The core of the current decarbonization challenge is the shift in strategy. In California, the financial incentive for rooftop solar under **NEM 2.0** was drastically reduced by **75%** with the introduction of **NEM 3.0**. The new strategy emphasizes **electrification**, which involves replacing natural gas appliances (stoves, water heaters) with electric alternatives like induction cooktops and **heat pump water heaters**.

**Source:** Class plan and rules; Challenges in Decarbonizing our Energy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1a-6.0 (Time: 15:01 - 19:12)
**Content Summary:**
Data centers, particularly those powering **large language models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT, represent a rapidly growing area of energy consumption, with a single large center consuming power equivalent to a small town. The primary challenge is managing the tremendous amount of waste **heat** generated by the servers, which is currently removed by power-intensive **chillers** (large air conditioners). This high-density energy challenge necessitates innovative thermal management strategies, such as **liquid cooling**, where servers are submerged in dielectric fluids. Furthermore, the intermittent nature of renewable energy (solar and wind) drives the need for **thermal and battery storage**. For data centers, **cold thermal storage** is highlighted as a solution to run chillers during off-peak hours (at night) when electricity is cheaper, storing the "cold" for use during the day.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Introduction to the first law of thermodynamics
**Source:** Class plan and rules; Challenges in Decarbonizing our Energy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1a-7.0 (Time: 19:13 - 40:13)
**Content Summary:**
The introduction to the First Law of Thermodynamics establishes the fundamental principle of **Conservation of Energy**. The law is mathematically expressed as $\Delta U = Q - W$, relating the change in a system's internal energy ($\Delta U$) to the energy transferred via **heat ($Q$)** and **work ($W$)**. The lecture defines a **system** and its **boundary**, which are crucial for applying the law. It clarifies the **sign conventions** for heat and work: **Heat ($Q$)** is positive when added to the system, and **Work ($W$)** is positive when done *by* the system. This foundational law is essential for subsequent course modules, including the analysis of engineering cycles and non-violating perpetual motion concepts.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Learning Objectives

**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-1.0 (Time: 00:00 - 01:55)
**Content Summary:**
The lecture begins by stating the goal is to move into entropy *analysis*. The key learning objectives are established: being able to analyze a compressor, specifically looking at ways to make it more effective using **intercooling**, and starting with a **general entropy balance** to apply to a heat exchanger. A two-minute quiz is then presented to the students, involving a steady flow reversible process from state 1 to 2 to 3 on a **Temperature vs. Specific Entropy (T-s) plot**. The question asks for the total heat transfer for this reversible process.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Comparing Control Volumes: Open vs. Closed System
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-2.0 (Time: 01:56 - 2:52)
**Content Summary:**
Before proceeding with entropy analysis, the lecture briefly reviews the two primary system types: **closed systems** (e.g., piston-cylinders) and **open systems** (control volumes). A **closed system** does not exchange mass, only heat or work. An **open system** (control volume) allows for mass transfer, which also carries energy into or out of the system. The energy analysis for closed systems typically involves changes in internal energy ($\Delta U$), while open systems are often analyzed using **rate notation** ($\dot{W}, \dot{Q}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Multisage Compressor With Cooling
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Time: 02:53 - 26:34)
**Content Summary:**
The section begins by comparing the work produced in a closed system (**$P\text{d}V$**) versus an open system (**$V\text{d}P$**). The main topic then shifts to designing more **efficient compressor systems** using a two-stage compression process with an **intercooler** between the stages. The logic is that compressing a hot gas requires more work, so cooling the gas (intercooling) after the first stage makes the second stage of compression easier, thereby **reducing the total work input**. The T-s diagram is used to illustrate the process, showing that the intercooling stage involves **taking heat out** of the system, which results in a **decrease in entropy**. A quantitative example is solved for a multi-stage compressor with air.

---
### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 26:35 - 33:54)
**Content Summary:**
The general **rate form of the entropy balance (Second Law)** is developed: $\frac{dS}{dt} = \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_k}{T_k} + \sum \dot{m}_i s_i - \sum \dot{m}_e s_e + \dot{S}_{gen}$. The key difference from the First Law, which is an energy balance, is the presence of the **rate of entropy generation ($\dot{S}_{gen}$)**, as entropy can be created but not destroyed. The lecture then applies the balance to an **Adiabatic, Steady Flow Heat Exchanger** (where $\frac{dS}{dt}=0$ and $\dot{Q}=0$), which simplifies to $\dot{S}_{gen} = \sum \dot{m}_e s_e - \sum \dot{m}_i s_i$. This simplified form, $\dot{S}_{gen} = \dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$, sets up the next example problem.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Heat exchanger entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-5.0 (Time: 33:55 - 41:43)
**Content Summary:**
The lecture proceeds to solve the adiabatic, steady-flow, counterflow heat exchanger problem. The first part is to find the **Rate of Heat Transfer ($\dot{Q}$)** using the **Energy Balance (First Law)** for either the cold or hot fluid stream. The second part is to find the **Rate of Entropy Generation ($\dot{S}_{gen}$)** using the simplified Entropy Balance, $\dot{S}_{gen} = \dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Develop the conservation of mass principle
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-2.0 (Time: 11:14 - 28:44)
**Content Summary:**
This section is dedicated to developing the **Conservation of Mass Principle** for a **Control Volume (CV)**. The derivation uses the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** to relate the time rate of change of mass in the system to the change of mass within the CV plus the net mass flow across the boundaries. The final result is the rate form of the mass balance equation: $\\frac{dM_{CV}}{dt} = \\sum_{in} \\dot{m}_{in} - \\sum_{out} \\dot{m}_{out}$. The lecturer then simplifies this for **steady flow**, where the mass of the CV is constant, leading to the condition that the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out: $\\sum \\dot{m}_{in} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{out}$.

The final work output is calculated using the property values obtained from steam tables (pyCalor).

An example of **isochoric (constant volume) cooling** of **air** in a **rigid, impermeable container** is solved. The goal is to determine the final temperature ($T_2$) and the heat transferred out ($Q_{out}$). The First Law simplifies to $\Delta U = -Q_{out}$ because for an **isochoric process, work is zero** ($W_{in} = W_{out} = 0$). For an ideal gas, the **change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) depends only on temperature**. Using the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$)**, the relation is $m c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{out}$. The **ideal gas equation** ($p v = R T$) is then used to compute the state properties needed to find $T_2$ and $Q_{out}$.

The term "thermodynamics" comes from Greek/Latin for "heat" and "power." While the field has branched into chemistry and information theory, the course will retain the focus on **mechanical work** and treat systems as a **continuum**, consistent with the axiom of **conservation of energy**. The microscopic view of disordered atomic motion is left to courses like statistical mechanics.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Thermodynamic Postulates and Systems

It introduces the concept of an **equation of state**, explaining that if one can measure a sufficient number of **independent properties** (typically two), all other properties of the system can be determined. This principle is illustrated using the **Ideal Gas Law** ($P=f(V,T)$), where knowing two independent properties provides **complete information** about the system's state.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Independent and Dependent Properties
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-5.0 (Time: 08:32 - 13:29)

This section uses **multivariable calculus** to illustrate the relationship between **two independent properties** ($X_1, X_2$) and the resulting **dependent property** ($X_3$), emphasizing that fixing $X_1$ and $X_2$ defines a specific point on a surface, which also yields information about the **derivatives** (rate of change). This principle is valid for a **pure substance** (like nitrogen or air, but not air with condensed liquid oxygen). The lecture connects this to the **pyCalor Python module**, where defining the substance and **two independent properties** creates a state object ($	ext{ST}$) from which all other properties (e.g., $	ext{ST.U}$) can be calculated, thereby simplifying complex calculations in a cycle (e.g., using a PV diagram).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-6.0 (Time: 13:30 - 20:27)

The discussion emphasizes that thermodynamics is interested in **changes in energy** from a **reference state**, not absolute values. **Little $u$** ($u$) is defined as **internal energy per mass** (J/kg) for a **simplified system** where motion, gravity, and external fields are **neglected**. In this case, $u$ depends only on two independent properties (e.g., T and specific volume), allowing its values to be **tabulated** (or calculated by pyCalor). **Big $U$** ($U$) is the **total internal energy** (Joules).

Using a plot of **Internal Energy ($U$) vs. Specific Volume ($v$) and entropy ($S$)**, the lecture demonstrates how to determine other properties using **derivatives**. Specifically, the **derivative** of $U$ with respect to $v$ at constant $S$ yields **pressure (P)**, and the derivative of $U$ with respect to $S$ at constant $v$ yields **temperature (T)**. This illustrates that once the point is defined by $X_1$ and $X_2$, all other properties follow from mathematical relations.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Determine the properties of water at 200 deg. C and 150 kPa
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-7.0 (Time: 29:20 - 30:45)

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Throttling and Expansion Valves
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5c-1.0 (Time: 00:28 - 19:45)
**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on **throttling valves/expansion valves** within a refrigeration cycle, emphasizing that it is an **isenthalpic process** ($\mathbf{h_{\text{in}} = h_{\text{out}}}$). This condition is met by assuming **no work** and **no heat transfer** (adiabatic/insulated, which is valid for a small orifice or porous plug). This expansion causes a temperature decrease, known as the **Joule-Thompson effect**. The process is visualized on a **pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram**, where a saturated liquid at high pressure ($x=0$) expands along a constant enthalpy line into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture at lower pressure.

**Content Summary:**
The segment analyzes a **heat exchanger** under **Steady-Flow Energy Analysis (SFEA)**. The overall energy balance for the adiabatic heat exchanger simplifies to $\mathbf{\sum \dot{m}_{\text{in}} h_{\text{in}} = \sum \dot{m}_{\text{out}} h_{\text{out}}}$. Applying this to the two streams (refrigerant, $R$, and water, $w$): $\mathbf{\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2) = \dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$. The problem involves determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water ($\dot{m}_w$) and the heat transfer rate from the refrigerant to the water ($\mathbf{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2)}$), which is also equal to the heat gained by the water ($\mathbf{\dot{Q}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$).

**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass that does not cross the boundary), the **First Law of Thermodynamics** states that the only two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. This is the fundamental definition of a closed system. The **direction of heat transfer** is determined *only* by the **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)**, moving from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. Conversely, **work** is any energy transfer mechanism *other than* heat.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Terminology
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-8.0 (Time: 20:03 - 21:05)
**Content Summary:**
An **adiabatic process** is one in which there is absolutely **no heat transfer** ($Q=0$). This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer by work to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-9.0 (Time: 21:06 - 29:42)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-10.0 (Time: 29:43 - 32:59)
**Content Summary:**
The section summarizes the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a **closed system** as $\\Delta U = Q_{in} - W_{out}$. This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\\Delta U = Q$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Mechanisms of Energy Transfer For a Closed System
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-12.0 (Time: 43:07 - 46:19)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\\\mathbf{\\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$). This emphasizes that work and heat are **path functions**, while internal energy is a **property** (state function).

This segment introduces and solves an **energy balance problem for a closed system** (fixed mass) involving water vapor in a piston-cylinder device. The process involves **electrical work transferred in ($W_{e, in}$) and heat transfer ($Q$)** while the system is maintained at **constant pressure**. The key theoretical derivation shows that for a constant pressure closed system, the boundary work can be absorbed into the internal energy term ($U$), resulting in a simplified energy balance where $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = \Delta H$ (or $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$). The example is solved using **superheated steam tables** to determine the final temperature and the change in enthalpy.

The process involves **electrical work input ($W_{e, in}$), heat loss ($Q_{out}$), and boundary work**. Since Nitrogen is treated as an **ideal gas**, the enthalpy change ($\\Delta h$) is approximated using the **constant pressure specific heat ($C_p$)** and temperature change, $\\\\Delta h \\\\approx C_p \\\\Delta T$. The constant pressure energy balance ($Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$) is used to determine the **final temperature ($T_2$)** of the gas.

It then introduces a new example: the **cooling of a hot solid block (iron) dropped into a cold water bath**. The combined system (iron + water) is treated as an **adiabatic, closed system** with no work, meaning the **total change in internal energy is zero** ($\\\\Delta U_{sys} = 0$). The objective is to determine the **final equilibrium temperature ($T_2$)** by setting the sum of the internal energy changes for the iron and the water to zero, using the $\\\\Delta U = m c \\\\Delta T$ approximation for both incompressible components.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Cooling of a solid block

**Content Summary:**
This segment introduces and begins solving a new closed-system example: the **cooling of a hot solid block (iron) dropped into a cold water bath**. This process is treated as an **adiabatic, closed system** with no work, leading to the **total change in internal energy being zero** ($\\\\Delta U_{sys} = 0$). The objective is to determine the **final equilibrium temperature ($T_2$)** by summing the internal energy changes for the iron and the water to zero.

**Content Summary:**
The lecture begins by stating the goal is to move into entropy *analysis*. The key learning objectives are established: being able to analyze a compressor, specifically looking at ways to make it more effective using **intercooling**, and starting with a **general entropy balance** to apply to a heat exchanger. A two-minute quiz is then presented to the students, involving a steady flow reversible process from state 1 to 2 to 3 on a **Temperature vs. Specific Entropy (T-s) plot**. The question asks for the total heat transfer for this reversible process.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Comparing Control Volumes: Open vs. Closed System
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-2.0 (Time: 01:56 - 2:52)
**Content Summary:**
Before proceeding with entropy analysis, the lecture briefly reviews the two primary system types: **closed systems** (e.g., piston-cylinders) and **open systems** (control volumes). A **closed system** does not exchange mass, only heat or work. An **open system** (control volume) allows for mass transfer, which also carries energy into or out of the system. The energy analysis for closed systems typically involves changes in internal energy ($\\Delta U$), while open systems are often analyzed using **rate notation** ($\\dot{W}, \\dot{Q}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Multisage Compressor With Cooling
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Time: 02:53 - 26:34)
**Content Summary:**
The section begins by comparing the work produced in a closed system (**$P\\text{d}V$**) versus an open system (**$V\\text{d}P$**). The main topic then shifts to designing more **efficient compressor systems** using a two-stage compression process with an **intercooler** between the stages. The logic is that compressing a hot gas requires more work, so cooling the gas (intercooling) after the first stage makes the second stage of compression easier, thereby **reducing the total work input**. The T-s diagram is used to illustrate the process, showing that the intercooling stage involves **taking heat out** of the system, which results in a **decrease in entropy**. A quantitative example is solved for a multi-stage compressor with air.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 26:35 - 33:54)
**Content Summary:**
The general **rate form of the entropy balance (Second Law)** is developed: $\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\sum \\frac{\\dot{Q}_k}{T_k} + \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i - \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e + \\dot{S}_{gen}$. The key difference from the First Law, which is an energy balance, is the presence of the **rate of entropy generation ($\\dot{S}_{gen}$)**, as entropy can be created but not destroyed. The lecture then applies the balance to an **Adiabatic, Steady Flow Heat Exchanger** (where $\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$ and $\\dot{Q}=0$), which simplifies to $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e - \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i$. This simplified form, $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \\dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$, sets up the next example problem.

**Content Summary:**
An **isentropic process** is defined by the conditions of being **adiabatic (no heat transfer)** and operating **reversibly (no friction)**. A process that is only reversible but includes heat transfer is termed **internally reversible**. Since **entropy is a property**, in an isentropic steady flow device, the **specific entropy remains constant** ($s_{in} = s_{out}$). This condition provides the **theoretical limit of performance** and simplifies power plant analysis.

By applying the **First Law for a steady-flow device** (neglecting kinetic/potential energy and heat), $w_{out}$ simplifies to the **difference in specific enthalpy** ($\\Delta h$). The isentropic condition ($s_1 = s_2$) allows the unknown outlet enthalpy ($h_2$) to be determined using the given outlet pressure ($P_2$) and the known inlet entropy ($s_1$). The final work output value is stated as **350 kJ/kg**, demonstrating how entropy simplifies the calculation of **maximum performance**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Differential entropy change relations
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The lecture derives **differential entropy change (TdS) relations** for an **ideal gas** to analyze isentropic devices (like compressors) without property tables. Two TdS relations are established: $TdS = dU + PdV$ and $TdS = dH - VdP$. Applying the **ideal gas law** and setting $dS=0$ for an isentropic process (assuming constant specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$), the derivation results in the power-law relationships between state variables (T, P, V), which are simplified using the **adiabatic index $\\kappa = C_p/C_v$** to the common forms.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Develop the conservation of mass principle
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-2.0 (Time: 11:14 - 28:44)
**Content Summary:**
This section is dedicated to developing the **Conservation of Mass Principle** for a **Control Volume (CV)**. The derivation uses the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** to relate the time rate of change of mass in the system to the change of mass within the CV plus the net mass flow across the boundaries. The final result is the rate form of the mass balance equation: $\\\\frac{dM_{CV}}{dt} = \\\\sum_{in} \\\\dot{m}_{in} - \\\\sum_{out} \\\\dot{m}_{out}$. The lecturer then simplifies this for **steady flow**, where the mass of the CV is constant, leading to the condition that the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out: $\\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{in} = \\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{out}$.

**Content Summary:**
The focus shifts to developing the **Conservation of Energy Equation** for a **Control Volume**. This analysis accounts for energy transfer via heat, work, and mass flow. A crucial step is the separation of **total work** into **flow work (\\\\dot{W}_{flow})** and **shaft work (\\\\dot{W}_{shaft})**. The derivation then introduces the property of **enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)**, which conveniently combines the internal energy ($u$) carried by the mass flow with the necessary flow work ($Pv$). This results in the final energy term carried by the mass flow being a combination of $h + ke + pe$.

The full **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)** is applied, including changes in enthalpy (\\\\Delta h), kinetic energy (\\\\Delta ke), and potential energy (\\\\Delta pe). The lecturer demonstrates how the enthalpy change terms dominate, allowing for a simplification of the equation to primarily: $\\\\dot{W}_{out} = \\\\dot{m} (h_1 - h_2)$, where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are specific enthalpies at the inlet and exit, respectively. The final work output is calculated using the property values obtained from steam tables (pyCalor).

An example of **isochoric (constant volume) cooling** of **air** in a **rigid, impermeable container** is solved. The goal is to determine the final temperature ($T_2$) and the heat transferred out ($Q_{out}$). The First Law simplifies to $\\Delta U = -Q_{out}$ because for an **isochoric process, work is zero** ($W_{in} = W_{out} = 0$). For an ideal gas, the **change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) depends only on temperature**. Using the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$)**, the relation is $m c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{out}$. The **ideal gas equation** ($p v = R T$) is then used to compute the state properties needed to find $T_2$ and $Q_{out}$.

Running the cycle in \\textbf{reverse} transforms it from a thermal engine (clockwise) into a \\textbf{heat pump} or refrigerator (counterclockwise), which pumps heat from the low-temperature reservoir ($T_L$) to the high-temperature reservoir ($T_H$). The \\textbf{First Law of Thermodynamics} for a cycle dictates that $\\Delta U = 0$, meaning the \\textbf{net work out} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) must equal the \\textbf{net heat in} ($Q_{\\text{net,in}}$).

For the steady-state cycle, the \\textbf{First Law} is applied, where $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{net,in}}$. The \\textbf{net power output} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) is calculated using the given heat rates, accounting for losses ($Q_{\\text{loss}}$): $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{in}} - (Q_{\\text{out}} + Q_{\\text{loss}})$. With $Q_{\\text{in}} = 280 \\text{ GJ/h}$, $Q_{\\text{out}} = 165 \\text{ GJ/h}$, and $Q_{\\text{loss}} = 8 \\text{ GJ/h}$, the net power output is $107 \\text{ GJ/h}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Deriving the Efficiency of an Ideal Gas Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-3.0 (Time: 13:39 - 33:21)
**Content Summary:**
This segment is dedicated to \\textbf{deriving the maximum theoretical efficiency ($\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}}$)} of a heat engine based on the reversible \\textbf{Carnot Cycle}, using the assumption of an \\textbf{ideal gas} as the working fluid. The work and heat transfer for the isothermal processes are derived using the boundary work definition ($\\delta W = P dV$) and the ideal gas law ($PV = RT$), resulting in the form $W = Q = R T \\ln(\\frac{V_{\\text{final}}}{V_{\\text{initial}}})$. The key step involves showing that the volume ratios for the isothermal processes are related by the adiabatic processes: $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{V_3}{V_4}$. This leads to the final expression for the \\textbf{Carnot efficiency}, which is independent of the working fluid's properties and depends only on the absolute temperatures of the reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Refrigeration Cycle

**Content Summary:**
This segment defines the performance measures for devices that run the Carnot cycle in reverse: \\textbf{refrigerators} and \\textbf{heat pumps}. The measure of performance is the \\textbf{Coefficient of Performance (COP)}. For a refrigerator, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_R = \\frac{Q_L}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired cooling over cost). For a heat pump, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\frac{Q_H}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired heating over cost). Using the First Law ($Q_H = Q_L + W_{\\text{net,in}}$), the relationship $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\text{COP}_R + 1}$ is established. The \\textbf{Maximum (Carnot) COPs} are introduced, which depend only on the absolute temperatures $T_H$ and $T_L$: $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{R, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_L}{T_H - T_L}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_H}{T_H - T_L}}$.

This leads to the definition of **enthalpy ($H$)** as the combination of **internal energy ($U$)** and **flow work ($PV$)**. The use of **specific enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)** is justified because it greatly simplifies the **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)** by combining the internal energy and flow work into a single property.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-5.0 (Time: 15:11 - 24:09)
**Content Summary:**
This final segment establishes the two **Carnot Principles**: 1) The efficiency of an irreversible engine is always less than that of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{irr}} < \\eta_{\\text{rev}}}$). 2) All reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs have the same efficiency ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{rev,A}} = \\eta_{\\text{rev,B}}}$). This leads to the derivation of the **Carnot Thermal Efficiency** formula, which depends only on the absolute temperatures of the hot ($T_H$) and cold ($T_L$) reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_L}{T_H}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Terminology
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-8.0 (Time: 20:03 - 21:05)
**Content Summary:**
An **adiabatic process** is one in which there is absolutely **no heat transfer** ($Q=0$). This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer by work to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-9.0 (Time: 21:06 - 29:42)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-10.0 (Time: 29:43 - 32:59)
**Content Summary:**
The section summarizes the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a **closed system** as $\\Delta U = Q_{in} - W_{out}$. This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\\Delta U = Q$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Mechanisms of Energy Transfer For a Closed System
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-12.0 (Time: 43:07 - 46:19)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\\\mathbf{\\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$). This emphasizes that work and heat are **path functions**, while internal energy is a **property** (state function).

The process involves **electrical work transferred in ($W_{e, in}$) and heat transfer ($Q$)** while the system is maintained at **constant pressure**. The key theoretical derivation shows that for a constant pressure closed system, the boundary work can be absorbed into the internal energy term ($U$), resulting in a simplified energy balance where $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = \Delta H$ (or $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$). The example is solved using **superheated steam tables** to determine the final temperature and the change in enthalpy.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Comparing Control Volumes: Open vs. Closed System
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
Before proceeding with entropy analysis, the lecture briefly reviews the two primary system types: **closed systems** (e.g., piston-cylinders) and **open systems** (control volumes). A **closed system** does not exchange mass, only heat or work. An **open system** (control volume) allows for mass transfer, which also carries energy into or out of the system. The energy analysis for closed systems typically involves changes in internal energy ($\\Delta U$), while open systems are often analyzed using **rate notation** ($\\dot{W}, \\dot{Q}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Multisage Compressor With Cooling
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Time: 02:53 - 26:34)
**Content Summary:**
The section begins by comparing the work produced in a closed system (**$P\\text{d}V$**) versus an open system (**$V\\text{d}P$**). The main topic then shifts to designing more **efficient compressor systems** using a two-stage compression process with an **intercooler** between the stages. The logic is that compressing a hot gas requires more work, so cooling the gas (intercooling) after the first stage makes the second stage of compression easier, thereby **reducing the total work input**. The T-s diagram is used to illustrate the process, showing that the intercooling stage involves **taking heat out** of the system, which results in a **decrease in entropy**. A quantitative example is solved for a multi-stage compressor with air.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 26:35 - 33:54)
**Content Summary:**
The general **rate form of the entropy balance (Second Law)** is developed: $\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\sum \\frac{\\dot{Q}_k}{T_k} + \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i - \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e + \\dot{S}_{gen}$. The key difference from the First Law, which is an energy balance, is the presence of the **rate of entropy generation ($\\dot{S}_{gen}$)**, as entropy can be created but not destroyed. The lecture then applies the balance to an **Adiabatic, Steady Flow Heat Exchanger** (where $\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$ and $\\dot{Q}=0$), which simplifies to $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e - \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i$. This simplified form, $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \\dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$, sets up the next example problem.

A process that is only reversible but includes heat transfer is termed **internally reversible**. Since **entropy is a property**, in an isentropic steady flow device, the **specific entropy remains constant** ($s_{in} = s_{out}$). This condition provides the **theoretical limit of performance** and simplifies power plant analysis.

The isentropic condition ($s_1 = s_2$) allows the unknown outlet enthalpy ($h_2$) to be determined using the given outlet pressure ($P_2$) and the known inlet entropy ($s_1$). The final work output value is stated as **350 kJ/kg**, demonstrating how entropy simplifies the calculation of **maximum performance**.

The lecture derives **differential entropy change (TdS) relations** for an **ideal gas** to analyze isentropic devices (like compressors) without property tables. Two TdS relations are established: $TdS = dU + PdV$ and $TdS = dH - VdP$. Applying the **ideal gas law** and setting $dS=0$ for an isentropic process (assuming constant specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$), the derivation results in the power-law relationships between state variables (T, P, V), which are simplified using the **adiabatic index $\\kappa = C_p/C_v$** to the common forms.

**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-2.0 (Time: 11:14 - 28:44)
**Content Summary:**
This section is dedicated to developing the **Conservation of Mass Principle** for a **Control Volume (CV)**. The derivation uses the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** to relate the time rate of change of mass in the system to the change of mass within the CV plus the net mass flow across the boundaries. The final result is the rate form of the mass balance equation: $\\\\frac{dM_{CV}}{dt} = \\\\sum_{in} \\\\dot{m}_{in} - \\\\sum_{out} \\\\dot{m}_{out}$. The lecturer then simplifies this for **steady flow**, where the mass of the CV is constant, leading to the condition that the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out: $\\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{in} = \\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{out}$.

This results in the final energy term carried by the mass flow being a combination of $h + ke + pe$.

An example of **isochoric (constant volume) cooling** of **air** in a **rigid, impermeable container** is solved. The goal is to determine the final temperature ($T_2$) and the heat transferred out ($Q_{out}$). The First Law simplifies to $\\Delta U = -Q_{out}$ because for an **isochoric process, work is zero** ($W_{in} = W_{out} = 0$). For an ideal gas, the **change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) depends only on temperature**. Using the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$)**, the relation is $m c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{out}$. The **ideal gas equation** ($p v = R T$) is then used to compute the state properties needed to find $T_2$ and $Q_{out}$.

**Content Summary:**
This brief section is dedicated to a **Group Work** activity where students are asked to **analyze three different work processes**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Net work
**Source:** Energy Analysis of Closed Systems (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L4a-7.0 (Time: 31:53 - 34:39)
**Content Summary:**
This segment analyzes the net work and energy transfer for a **thermodynamic cycle** shown on a P-V diagram. The key point established is that the **net work out ($W_{net, out}$)** of a closed-system cycle is graphically represented by the **area enclosed by the cycle’s path** on the P-V diagram. By applying the **First Law of Thermodynamics** ($\\\\Delta U = Q_{net, in} - W_{net, out}$) to a cycle, and recognizing that the **change in internal energy ($\\\\Delta U$) is zero** (since the system returns to its initial state), the lecturer concludes that the **net work output must equal the net heat input ($W_{net, out} = Q_{net, in}$)**. This relationship is a fundamental concept for analyzing engines and other cyclic devices.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle and Reversed Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-1.0 (Time: 00:25 - 2:30)
**Content Summary:**
The segment reviews the \\textbf{Carnot Cycle}, noting it operates between two temperatures ($T_H$ and $T_L$) and features four fully \\textbf{reversible} processes: two isothermal heat transfers and two adiabatic (isentropic) work transfers. Running the cycle in \\textbf{reverse} transforms it from a thermal engine (clockwise) into a \\textbf{heat pump} or refrigerator (counterclockwise), which pumps heat from the low-temperature reservoir ($T_L$) to the high-temperature reservoir ($T_H$). The \\textbf{First Law of Thermodynamics} for a cycle dictates that $\\Delta U = 0$, meaning the \\textbf{net work out} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) must equal the \\textbf{net heat in} ($Q_{\\text{net,in}}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Steam Power Plant: Worked Out Problem
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-2.0 (Time: 02:31 - 13:38)

The instructor analyzes a \\textbf{thermoelectric power plant} cycle consisting of a \\textbf{pump} ($W_{\\text{in}}$), a \\textbf{boiler} ($Q_{\\text{in}}$), a \\textbf{turbine} ($W_{\\text{out}}$), and a \\textbf{condenser} ($Q_{\\text{out}}$). For the steady-state cycle, the \\textbf{First Law} is applied, where $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{net,in}}$. The \\textbf{net power output} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) is calculated using the given heat rates, accounting for losses ($Q_{\\text{loss}}$): $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{in}} - (Q_{\\text{out}} + Q_{\\text{loss}})$. With $Q_{\\text{in}} = 280 \\text{ GJ/h}$, $Q_{\\text{out}} = 165 \\text{ GJ/h}$, and $Q_{\\text{loss}} = 8 \\text{ GJ/h}$, the net power output is $107 \\text{ GJ/h}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Deriving the Efficiency of an Ideal Gas Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-3.0 (Time: 13:39 - 33:21)
**Content Summary:**
This segment is dedicated to \\textbf{deriving the maximum theoretical efficiency ($\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}}$)} of a heat engine based on the reversible \\textbf{Carnot Cycle}, using the assumption of an \\textbf{ideal gas} as the working fluid. The work and heat transfer for the isothermal processes are derived using the boundary work definition ($\\delta W = P dV$) and the ideal gas law ($PV = RT$), resulting in the form $W = Q = R T \\ln(\\frac{V_{\\text{final}}}{V_{\\text{initial}}})$. The key step involves showing that the volume ratios for the isothermal processes are related by the adiabatic processes: $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{V_3}{V_4}$. This leads to the final expression for the \\textbf{Carnot efficiency}, which is independent of the working fluid's properties and depends only on the absolute temperatures of the reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Refrigeration Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
This segment defines the performance measures for devices that run the Carnot cycle in reverse: \\textbf{refrigerators} and \\textbf{heat pumps}. The measure of performance is the \\textbf{Coefficient of Performance (COP)}. For a refrigerator, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_R = \\frac{Q_L}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired cooling over cost). For a heat pump, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\frac{Q_H}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired heating over cost). Using the First Law ($Q_H = Q_L + W_{\\text{net,in}}$), the relationship $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\text{COP}_R + 1}$ is established. The \\textbf{Maximum (Carnot) COPs} are introduced, which depend only on the absolute temperatures $T_H$ and $T_L$: $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{R, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_L}{T_H - T_L}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_H}{T_H - T_L}}$.

This leads to the definition of **enthalpy ($H$)** as the combination of **internal energy ($U$)** and **flow work ($PV$)**. The use of **specific enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)** is justified because it greatly simplifies the **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)** by combining the internal energy and flow work into a single property.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Throttling and Expansion Valves
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on **throttling valves/expansion valves** within a refrigeration cycle, emphasizing that it is an **isenthalpic process** ($\\mathbf{h_{\\text{in}} = h_{\\text{out}}}$). This condition is met by assuming **no work** and **no heat transfer** (adiabatic/insulated, which is valid for a small orifice or porous plug). This expansion causes a temperature decrease, known as the **Joule-Thompson effect**. The process is visualized on a **pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram**, where a saturated liquid at high pressure ($x=0$) expands along a constant enthalpy line into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture at lower pressure.

The overall energy balance for the adiabatic heat exchanger simplifies to $\\mathbf{\\sum \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} h_{\\text{in}} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} h_{\\text{out}}}$. Applying this to the two streams (refrigerant, $R$, and water, $w$): $\\mathbf{\\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2) = \\dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$. The problem involves determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water ($\\dot{m}_w$) and the heat transfer rate from the refrigerant to the water ($\\mathbf{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{out}} = \\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2)}$), which is also equal to the heat gained by the water ($\\mathbf{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Perpetual Motion

**Content Summary:**
This segment discusses the theoretical limit of energy conversion, linking the impossibility of a **Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind (PMM2)** to the need for a fully **reversible cycle**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-5.0 (Time: 15:11 - 24:09)
**Content Summary:**
This final segment establishes the two **Carnot Principles**: 1) The efficiency of an irreversible engine is always less than that of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{irr}} < \\eta_{\\text{rev}}}$). 2) All reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs have the same efficiency ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{rev,A}} = \\eta_{\\text{rev,B}}}$). This leads to the derivation of the **Carnot Thermal Efficiency** formula, which depends only on the absolute temperatures of the hot ($T_H$) and cold ($T_L$) reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_L}{T_H}}$.

This is the fundamental definition of a closed system. The **direction of heat transfer** is determined *only* by the **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)**, moving from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. Conversely, **work** is any energy transfer mechanism *other than* heat.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Terminology
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-8.0 (Time: 20:03 - 21:05)
**Content Summary:**
An **adiabatic process** is one in which there is absolutely **no heat transfer** ($Q=0$). This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer by work to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-9.0 (Time: 21:06 - 29:42)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-10.0 (Time: 29:43 - 32:59)
**Content Summary:**
The section summarizes the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a **closed system** as $\\Delta U = Q_{in} - W_{out}$. This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\\Delta U = Q$.

The problem involves **shaft work input** ($W_{in}$) from a paddle wheel and **heat output** ($Q_{out}$) to the surroundings. The change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) is calculated using the form $\\mathbf{U_2 - U_1 = W_{in} - Q_{out}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Mechanisms of Energy Transfer For a Closed System
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-12.0 (Time: 43:07 - 46:19)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\\\mathbf{\\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$). This emphasizes that work and heat are **path functions**, while internal energy is a **property** (state function).

**Content Summary:**
This segment introduces and solves an **energy balance problem for a closed system** (fixed mass) involving water vapor in a piston-cylinder device. The process involves **electrical work transferred in ($W_{e, in}$) and heat transfer ($Q$)** while the system is maintained at **constant pressure**. The key theoretical derivation shows that for a constant pressure closed system, the boundary work can be absorbed into the internal energy term ($U$), resulting in a simplified energy balance where $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = \Delta H$ (or $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$). The example is solved using **superheated steam tables** to determine the final temperature and the change in enthalpy.

This section solves a second closed-system problem, this time involving **Nitrogen ($N_2$) gas** in a constant-pressure piston-cylinder device. The process involves **electrical work input ($W_{e, in}$), heat loss ($Q_{out}$), and boundary work**. Since Nitrogen is treated as an **ideal gas**, the enthalpy change ($\\Delta h$) is approximated using the **constant pressure specific heat ($C_p$)** and temperature change, $\\\\Delta h \\\\approx C_p \\\\Delta T$. The constant pressure energy balance ($Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$) is used to determine the **final temperature ($T_2$)** of the gas.

**Video Key:** Fa25-L4c-3.0 (Time: 37:26 - 42:55)
**Content Summary:**
This segment introduces the simplified thermodynamic properties for **incompressible substances** (liquids and solids). For these substances, the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$) is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$)**, and both are generally represented as $c$. Furthermore, because the specific volume ($v$) is essentially constant, the **change in internal energy ($\\\\Delta u$) is approximately equal to the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta h$)**. The key relationship derived for property change is $\\\\Delta u \\\\approx \\\\Delta h \\\\approx c \\\\Delta T$.

**Video Key:** Fa25-L4c-4.0 (Time: 42:56 - 43:15)
**Content Summary:**
This final section first provides a brief summary of the closed-system energy balance problems solved so far (steam and ideal gas).

**Source:** Energy Analysis of Closed Systems (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L4c-5.0 (Time: 43:16 - 48:47)
**Content Summary:**
This segment introduces and begins solving a new closed-system example: the **cooling of a hot solid block (iron) dropped into a cold water bath**. This process is treated as an **adiabatic, closed system** with no work, leading to the **total change in internal energy being zero** ($\\\\Delta U_{sys} = 0$). The objective is to determine the **final equilibrium temperature ($T_2$)** by summing the internal energy changes for the iron and the water to zero.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Introduction to Entropy ($S$).
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-1.0 (Time: 00:00 - 04:06)
**Content Summary:**
The lecture begins by introducing the concept of \\textbf{entropy} ($S$) and its utility in \\textbf{isentropic processes}. The instructor notes that entropy is a weird thing that cannot be directly measured. The \\textbf{Temperature-Entropy (TS) diagram} is introduced as a more useful tool than the Pressure-Volume (PV) diagram for analyzing \\textbf{power cycles}. The four-step \\textbf{Carnot cycle} (two isothermal, two isentropic processes) is illustrated on the TS diagram, where the area enclosed represents the \\textbf{net heat in} (which equals the \\textbf{net work out}) for the cycle. Entropy is presented as a helpful compass to guide process analysis and determine power output.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Change in Entropy in Thermal Conduction
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-2.0 (Time: 04:07 - 18:07)
**Content Summary:**
This segment analyzes the \\textbf{change in entropy} during \\textbf{thermal conduction} between two \\textbf{thermal reservoirs} (one hot, $T_1$, one cold, $T_2$) that transfer a heat magnitude $Q$. The fundamental equation for change in entropy is introduced: $\\mathbf{dS = \\delta Q/T}$. The units for entropy ($S$) are $\\text{kJ}/\\text{K}$ and specific entropy ($s$) are $\\text{kJ}/(\\text{kg}\\cdot \\text{K})$. The change in entropy for each control volume (CV) is calculated: $\\Delta S_1 = -Q/T_1$ (entropy decreases for the hot reservoir) and $\\Delta S_2 = +Q/T_2$ (entropy increases for the cold reservoir). The \\textbf{total entropy change of the system} is derived as $\\mathbf{\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = Q(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}$. The condition for a \\textbf{reversible process} is defined as $\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = 0$, which would only occur if $T_1 = T_2$. Since $T_1 > T_2$, the key takeaway is that the entropy of an isolated system must either remain constant (reversible) or \\textbf{increase} (irreversible/spontaneous heat flow), confirming the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-3.0 (Time: 18:08 - 19:52)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a conceptual transition, reminding the class that \\textbf{entropy ($S$) is a thermodynamic property} like internal energy ($U$) or enthalpy ($H$). For a pure substance, determining two independent properties provides complete information, including the value of specific entropy ($s$). The instructor reinforces the importance of \\textbf{TS (Temperature-Entropy) diagrams} for analyzing power and gas cycles and emphasizes that entropy is \\textbf{not a path function}. The discussion concludes with a reflection on the formula $\\mathbf{dS = \\delta Q / T}$, which implies that energy has a value or quality (the essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Example: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-4.0 (Time: 19:53 - 35:06)
**Content Summary:**
The segment begins a detailed \\textbf{example problem} to calculate the entropy change for \\textbf{pure water} in an \\textbf{isobaric (constant pressure)} process within a piston-cylinder device. The process is depicted on a TS diagram, starting at State 1 as a \\textbf{compressed liquid} ($P_1 = 140 \\text{ kPa}$, $T_1 = 20^\\circ \\text{C}$) and moving toward a superheated vapor state. The instructor first determines the initial properties, including $s_1$ and $h_1$. A \\textbf{First Law energy balance} is applied to the closed system (piston-cylinder): $\\mathbf{\\Delta U = Q_{\\text{in}} - W_{\\text{out}}}$ (neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy). The \\textbf{work out} is calculated for the constant pressure process as $W_{\\text{out}} = P(V_2 - V_1)$ or $m P(v_2 - v_1)$. By manipulating the energy balance, the relationship $\\mathbf{Q_{\\text{in}} = \\Delta H}$ (change in enthalpy) is established, which simplifies the analysis. The video captions end mid-solution.

**Content Summary:**
The lecture begins by stating the goal is to move into entropy *analysis*. The key learning objectives are established: being able to analyze a compressor, specifically looking at ways to make it more effective using **intercooling**, and starting with a **general entropy balance** to apply to a heat exchanger.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Comparing Control Volumes: Open vs. Closed System
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-2.0 (Time: 01:56 - 2:52)
**Content Summary:**
Before proceeding with entropy analysis, the lecture briefly reviews the two primary system types: **closed systems** (e.g., piston-cylinders) and **open systems** (control volumes). A **closed system** does not exchange mass, only heat or work. An **open system** (control volume) allows for mass transfer, which also carries energy into or out of the system. The energy analysis for closed systems typically involves changes in internal energy ($\\Delta U$), while open systems are often analyzed using **rate notation** ($\\dot{W}, \\dot{Q}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Multisage Compressor With Cooling
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Time: 02:53 - 26:34)
**Content Summary:**
The section begins by comparing the work produced in a closed system (**$P\\text{d}V$**) versus an open system (**$V\\text{d}P$**). The main topic then shifts to designing more **efficient compressor systems** using a two-stage compression process with an **intercooler** between the stages. The logic is that compressing a hot gas requires more work, so cooling the gas (intercooling) after the first stage makes the second stage of compression easier, thereby **reducing the total work input**. The T-s diagram is used to illustrate the process, showing that the intercooling stage involves **taking heat out** of the system, which results in a **decrease in entropy**. A quantitative example is solved for a multi-stage compressor with air.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 26:35 - 33:54)
**Content Summary:**
The general **rate form of the entropy balance (Second Law)** is developed: $\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\sum \\frac{\\dot{Q}_k}{T_k} + \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i - \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e + \\dot{S}_{gen}$. The key difference from the First Law, which is an energy balance, is the presence of the **rate of entropy generation ($\\dot{S}_{gen}$)**, as entropy can be created but not destroyed. The lecture then applies the balance to an **Adiabatic, Steady Flow Heat Exchanger** (where $\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$ and $\\dot{Q}=0$), which simplifies to $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e - \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i$. This simplified form, $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \\dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$, sets up the next example problem.

An **isentropic process** is defined by the conditions of being **adiabatic (no heat transfer)** and operating **reversibly (no friction)**. A process that is only reversible but includes heat transfer is termed **internally reversible**. Since **entropy is a property**, in an isentropic steady flow device, the **specific entropy remains constant** ($s_{in} = s_{out}$). This condition provides the **theoretical limit of performance** and simplifies power plant analysis.

The isentropic condition ($s_1 = s_2$) allows the unknown outlet enthalpy ($h_2$) to be determined using the given outlet pressure ($P_2$) and the known inlet entropy ($s_1$). The final work output value is stated as **350 kJ/kg**, demonstrating how entropy simplifies the calculation of **maximum performance**.

The lecture derives **differential entropy change (TdS) relations** for an **ideal gas** to analyze isentropic devices (like compressors) without property tables. Two TdS relations are established: $TdS = dU + PdV$ and $TdS = dH - VdP$. Applying the **ideal gas law** and setting $dS=0$ for an isentropic process (assuming constant specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$), the derivation results in the power-law relationships between state variables (T, P, V), which are simplified using the **adiabatic index $\\kappa = C_p/C_v$** to the common forms.

**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-2.0 (Time: 11:14 - 28:44)
**Content Summary:**
This section is dedicated to developing the **Conservation of Mass Principle** for a **Control Volume (CV)**. The derivation uses the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** to relate the time rate of change of mass in the system to the change of mass within the CV plus the net mass flow across the boundaries. The final result is the rate form of the mass balance equation: $\\\\frac{dM_{CV}}{dt} = \\\\sum_{in} \\\\dot{m}_{in} - \\\\sum_{out} \\\\dot{m}_{out}$. The lecturer then simplifies this for **steady flow**, where the mass of the CV is constant, leading to the condition that the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out: $\\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{in} = \\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{out}$.

The segment reviews the \\textbf{Carnot Cycle}, noting it operates between two temperatures ($T_H$ and $T_L$) and features four fully \\textbf{reversible} processes: two isothermal heat transfers and two adiabatic (isentropic) work transfers. Running the cycle in \\textbf{reverse} transforms it from a thermal engine (clockwise) into a \\textbf{heat pump} or refrigerator (counterclockwise), which pumps heat from the low-temperature reservoir ($T_L$) to the high-temperature reservoir ($T_H$). The \\textbf{First Law of Thermodynamics} for a cycle dictates that $\\Delta U = 0$, meaning the \\textbf{net work out} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) must equal the \\textbf{net heat in} ($Q_{\\text{net,in}}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Steam Power Plant: Worked Out Problem
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-2.0 (Time: 02:31 - 13:38)
**Content Summary:**
The instructor analyzes a \\textbf{thermoelectric power plant} cycle consisting of a \\textbf{pump} ($W_{\\text{in}}$), a \\textbf{boiler} ($Q_{\\text{in}}$), a \\textbf{turbine} ($W_{\\text{out}}$), and a \\textbf{condenser} ($Q_{\\text{out}}$). For the steady-state cycle, the \\textbf{First Law} is applied, where $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{net,in}}$. The \\textbf{net power output} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) is calculated using the given heat rates, accounting for losses ($Q_{\\text{loss}}$): $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{in}} - (Q_{\\text{out}} + Q_{\\text{loss}})$. With $Q_{\\text{in}} = 280 \\text{ GJ/h}$, $Q_{\\text{out}} = 165 \\text{ GJ/h}$, and $Q_{\\text{loss}} = 8 \\text{ GJ/h}$, the net power output is $107 \\text{ GJ/h}$. The \\textbf{thermal efficiency} is calculated as $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{net,out}}}{Q_{\\text{in}}}}$, yielding a result of $\\mathbf{38\\%}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Deriving the Efficiency of an Ideal Gas Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-3.0 (Time: 13:39 - 33:21)
**Content Summary:**
This segment is dedicated to \\textbf{deriving the maximum theoretical efficiency ($\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}}$)} of a heat engine based on the reversible \\textbf{Carnot Cycle}, using the assumption of an \\textbf{ideal gas} as the working fluid. The work and heat transfer for the isothermal processes are derived using the boundary work definition ($\\delta W = P dV$) and the ideal gas law ($PV = RT$), resulting in the form $W = Q = R T \\ln(\\frac{V_{\\text{final}}}{V_{\\text{initial}}})$. The key step involves showing that the volume ratios for the isothermal processes are related by the adiabatic processes: $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{V_3}{V_4}$. This leads to the final expression for the \\textbf{Carnot efficiency}, which is independent of the working fluid's properties and depends only on the absolute temperatures of the reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Refrigeration Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
This segment defines the performance measures for devices that run the Carnot cycle in reverse: \\textbf{refrigerators} and \\textbf{heat pumps}. The measure of performance is the \\textbf{Coefficient of Performance (COP)}. For a refrigerator, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_R = \\frac{Q_L}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired cooling over cost). For a heat pump, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\frac{Q_H}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired heating over cost). Using the First Law ($Q_H = Q_L + W_{\\text{net,in}}$), the relationship $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\text{COP}_R + 1}$ is established. The \\textbf{Maximum (Carnot) COPs} are introduced, which depend only on the absolute temperatures $T_H$ and $T_L$: $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{R, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_L}{T_H - T_L}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_H}{T_H - T_L}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Throttling and Expansion Valves
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on **throttling valves/expansion valves** within a refrigeration cycle, emphasizing that it is an **isenthalpic process** ($\\mathbf{h_{\\text{in}} = h_{\\text{out}}}$). This condition is met by assuming **no work** and **no heat transfer** (adiabatic/insulated, which is valid for a small orifice or porous plug). This expansion causes a temperature decrease, known as the **Joule-Thompson effect**. The process is visualized on a **pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram**, where a saturated liquid at high pressure ($x=0$) expands along a constant enthalpy line into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture at lower pressure.

The overall energy balance for the adiabatic heat exchanger simplifies to $\\mathbf{\\sum \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} h_{\\text{in}} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} h_{\\text{out}}}$. Applying this to the two streams (refrigerant, $R$, and water, $w$): $\\mathbf{\\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2) = \\dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$. The problem involves determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water ($\\dot{m}_w$) and the heat transfer rate from the refrigerant to the water ($\\mathbf{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{out}} = \\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2)}$), which is also equal to the heat gained by the water ($\\mathbf{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-5.0 (Time: 15:11 - 24:09)
**Content Summary:**
This final segment establishes the two **Carnot Principles**: 1) The efficiency of an irreversible engine is always less than that of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{irr}} < \\eta_{\\text{rev}}}$). 2) All reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs have the same efficiency ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{rev,A}} = \\eta_{\\text{rev,B}}}$). This leads to the derivation of the **Carnot Thermal Efficiency** formula, which depends only on the absolute temperatures of the hot ($T_H$) and cold ($T_L$) reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_L}{T_H}}$.

**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-4.0 (Time: 04:12 - 06:23)
**Content Summary:**
For a simple system, **internal energy ($U$)** depends on two independent properties.

**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass that does not cross the boundary), the **First Law of Thermodynamics** states that the only two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. This is the fundamental definition of a closed system. The **direction of heat transfer** is determined *only* by the **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)**, moving from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. Conversely, **work** is any energy transfer mechanism *other than* heat.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Terminology
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-8.0 (Time: 20:03 - 21:05)
**Content Summary:**
An **adiabatic process** is one in which there is absolutely **no heat transfer** ($Q=0$). This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer by work to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-9.0 (Time: 21:06 - 29:42)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-10.0 (Time: 29:43 - 32:59)
**Content Summary:**
The section summarizes the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a **closed system** as $\\Delta U = Q_{in} - W_{out}$. This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\\Delta U = Q$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Mechanisms of Energy Transfer For a Closed System
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-12.0 (Time: 43:07 - 46:19)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\\\mathbf{\\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$). This emphasizes that work and heat are **path functions**, while internal energy is a **property** (state function).

This segment introduces and solves an **energy balance problem for a closed system** (fixed mass) involving water vapor in a piston-cylinder device. The process involves **electrical work transferred in ($W_{e, in}$) and heat transfer ($Q$)** while the system is maintained at **constant pressure**. The key theoretical derivation shows that for a constant pressure closed system, the boundary work can be absorbed into the internal energy term ($U$), resulting in a simplified energy balance where $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = \Delta H$ (or $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$). The example is solved using **superheated steam tables** to determine the final temperature and the change in enthalpy.

This section solves a second closed-system problem, this time involving **Nitrogen ($N_2$) gas** in a constant-pressure piston-cylinder device. The process involves **electrical work input ($W_{e, in}$), heat loss ($Q_{out}$), and boundary work**. Since Nitrogen is treated as an **ideal gas**, the enthalpy change ($\\Delta h$) is approximated using the **constant pressure specific heat ($C_p$)** and temperature change, $\\\\Delta h \\\\approx C_p \\\\Delta T$. The constant pressure energy balance ($Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$) is used to determine the **final temperature ($T_2$)** of the gas.

**Content Summary:**
This segment introduces the simplified thermodynamic properties for **incompressible substances** (liquids and solids). For these substances, the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$) is equal to the specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$)**, and both are generally represented as $c$. Furthermore, because the specific volume ($v$) is essentially constant, the **change in internal energy ($\\\\Delta u$) is approximately equal to the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta h$)**. The key relationship derived for property change is $\\\\Delta u \\\\approx \\\\Delta h \\\\approx c \\\\Delta T$.

**Content Summary:**
This final section first provides a brief summary of the closed-system energy balance problems solved so far (steam and ideal gas). It then introduces a new example: the **cooling of a hot solid block (iron) dropped into a cold water bath**. The combined system (iron + water) is treated as an **adiabatic, closed system** with no work, meaning the **total change in internal energy is zero** ($\\\\Delta U_{sys} = 0$). The objective is to determine the **final equilibrium temperature ($T_2$)** by setting the sum of the internal energy changes for the iron and the water to zero, using the $\\\\Delta U = m c \\\\Delta T$ approximation for both incompressible components.

**Content Summary:**
This segment introduces and begins solving a new closed-system example: the **cooling of a hot solid block (iron) dropped into a cold water bath**. This process is treated as an **adiabatic, closed system** with no work, leading to the **total change in internal energy being zero** ($\\\\Delta U_{sys} = 0$). The objective is to determine the **final equilibrium temperature ($T_2$)** by summing the internal energy changes for the iron and the water to zero. Since both are **incompressible substances** (solid and liquid), the property change approximation $\\\\Delta U \\\\approx m c \\\\Delta T$ is used for each component.

The lecture begins by introducing the concept of \\textbf{entropy} ($S$) and its utility in \\textbf{isentropic processes}. The instructor notes that entropy is a weird thing that cannot be directly measured. The \\textbf{Temperature-Entropy (TS) diagram} is introduced as a more useful tool than the Pressure-Volume (PV) diagram for analyzing \\textbf{power cycles}. The four-step \\textbf{Carnot cycle} (two isothermal, two isentropic processes) is illustrated on the TS diagram, where the area enclosed represents the \\textbf{net heat in} (which equals the \\textbf{net work out}) for the cycle. Entropy is presented as a helpful compass to guide process analysis and determine power output.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Change in Entropy in Thermal Conduction
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-2.0 (Time: 04:07 - 18:07)
**Content Summary:**
This segment analyzes the \\textbf{change in entropy} during \\textbf{thermal conduction} between two \\textbf{thermal reservoirs} (one hot, $T_1$, one cold, $T_2$) that transfer a heat magnitude $Q$. The fundamental equation for change in entropy is introduced: $\\mathbf{dS = \\delta Q/T}$. The units for entropy ($S$) are $\\text{kJ}/\\text{K}$ and specific entropy ($s$) are $\\text{kJ}/(\\text{kg}\\cdot \\text{K})$. The change in entropy for each control volume (CV) is calculated: $\\Delta S_1 = -Q/T_1$ (entropy decreases for the hot reservoir) and $\\Delta S_2 = +Q/T_2$ (entropy increases for the cold reservoir). The \\textbf{total entropy change of the system} is derived as $\\mathbf{\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = Q(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}$. The condition for a \\textbf{reversible process} is defined as $\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = 0$, which would only occur if $T_1 = T_2$. Since $T_1 > T_2$, the key takeaway is that the entropy of an isolated system must either remain constant (reversible) or \\textbf{increase} (irreversible/spontaneous heat flow), confirming the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-3.0 (Time: 18:08 - 19:52)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a conceptual transition, reminding the class that \\textbf{entropy ($S$) is a thermodynamic property} like internal energy ($U$) or enthalpy ($H$). For a pure substance, determining two independent properties provides complete information, including the value of specific entropy ($s$). The instructor reinforces the importance of \\textbf{TS (Temperature-Entropy) diagrams} for analyzing power and gas cycles and emphasizes that entropy is \\textbf{not a path function}. The discussion concludes with a reflection on the formula $\\mathbf{dS = \\delta Q / T}$, which implies that energy has a value or quality (the essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Example: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-4.0 (Time: 19:53 - 35:06)
**Content Summary:**
The segment begins a detailed \\textbf{example problem} to calculate the entropy change for \\textbf{pure water} in an \\textbf{isobaric (constant pressure)} process within a piston-cylinder device. The process is depicted on a TS diagram, starting at State 1 as a \\textbf{compressed liquid} ($P_1 = 140 \\text{ kPa}$, $T_1 = 20^\\circ \\text{C}$) and moving toward a superheated vapor state. The instructor first determines the initial properties, including $s_1$ and $h_1$. A \\textbf{First Law energy balance} is applied to the closed system (piston-cylinder): $\\mathbf{\\Delta U = Q_{\\text{in}} - W_{\\text{out}}}$ (neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy). The \\textbf{work out} is calculated for the constant pressure process as $W_{\\text{out}} = P(V_2 - V_1)$ or $m P(v_2 - v_1)$. By manipulating the energy balance, the relationship $\\mathbf{Q_{\\text{in}} = \\Delta H}$ (change in enthalpy) is established, which simplifies the analysis. The video captions end mid-solution.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Comparing Control Volumes: Open vs. Closed System
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-2.0 (Time: 01:56 - 2:52)
**Content Summary:**
Before proceeding with entropy analysis, the lecture briefly reviews the two primary system types: **closed systems** (e.g., piston-cylinders) and **open systems** (control volumes). A **closed system** does not exchange mass, only heat or work. An **open system** (control volume) allows for mass transfer, which also carries energy into or out of the system. The energy analysis for closed systems typically involves changes in internal energy ($\\Delta U$), while open systems are often analyzed using **rate notation** ($\\dot{W}, \\dot{Q}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Multisage Compressor With Cooling
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Time: 02:53 - 26:34)
**Content Summary:**
The section begins by comparing the work produced in a closed system (**$P\\text{d}V$**) versus an open system (**$V\\text{d}P$**). The main topic then shifts to designing more **efficient compressor systems** using a two-stage compression process with an **intercooler** between the stages. The logic is that compressing a hot gas requires more work, so cooling the gas (intercooling) after the first stage makes the second stage of compression easier, thereby **reducing the total work input**. The T-s diagram is used to illustrate the process, showing that the intercooling stage involves **taking heat out** of the system, which results in a **decrease in entropy**. A quantitative example is solved for a multi-stage compressor with air.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 26:35 - 33:54)
**Content Summary:**
The general **rate form of the entropy balance (Second Law)** is developed: $\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\sum \\frac{\\dot{Q}_k}{T_k} + \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i - \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e + \\dot{S}_{gen}$. The key difference from the First Law, which is an energy balance, is the presence of the **rate of entropy generation ($\\dot{S}_{gen}$)**, as entropy can be created but not destroyed. The lecture then applies the balance to an **Adiabatic, Steady Flow Heat Exchanger** (where $\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$ and $\\dot{Q}=0$), which simplifies to $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e - \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i$. This simplified form, $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \\dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$, sets up the next example problem.

**Content Summary:**
An **isentropic process** is defined by the conditions of being **adiabatic (no heat transfer)** and operating **reversibly (no friction)**. A process that is only reversible but includes heat transfer is termed **internally reversible**. Since **entropy is a property**, in an isentropic steady flow device, the **specific entropy remains constant** ($s_{in} = s_{out}$). This condition provides the **theoretical limit of performance** and simplifies power plant analysis.

By applying the **First Law for a steady-flow device** (neglecting kinetic/potential energy and heat), $w_{out}$ simplifies to the **difference in specific enthalpy** ($\\Delta h$). The isentropic condition ($s_1 = s_2$) allows the unknown outlet enthalpy ($h_2$) to be determined using the given outlet pressure ($P_2$) and the known inlet entropy ($s_1$). The final work output value is stated as **350 kJ/kg**, demonstrating how entropy simplifies the calculation of **maximum performance**.

**Content Summary:**
The lecture derives **differential entropy change (TdS) relations** for an **ideal gas** to analyze isentropic devices (like compressors) without property tables. Two TdS relations are established: $TdS = dU + PdV$ and $TdS = dH - VdP$. Applying the **ideal gas law** and setting $dS=0$ for an isentropic process (assuming constant specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$), the derivation results in the power-law relationships between state variables (T, P, V), which are simplified using the **adiabatic index $\\kappa = C_p/C_v$** to the common forms.

**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-2.0 (Time: 11:14 - 28:44)
**Content Summary:**
This section is dedicated to developing the **Conservation of Mass Principle** for a **Control Volume (CV)**. The derivation uses the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** to relate the time rate of change of mass in the system to the change of mass within the CV plus the net mass flow across the boundaries. The final result is the rate form of the mass balance equation: $\\\\frac{dM_{CV}}{dt} = \\\\sum_{in} \\\\dot{m}_{in} - \\\\sum_{out} \\\\dot{m}_{out}$. The lecturer then simplifies this for **steady flow**, where the mass of the CV is constant, leading to the condition that the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out: $\\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{in} = \\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{out}$.

A crucial step is the separation of **total work** into **flow work (\\\\dot{W}_{flow})** and **shaft work (\\\\dot{W}_{shaft})**. The derivation then introduces the property of **enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)**, which conveniently combines the internal energy ($u$) carried by the mass flow with the necessary flow work ($Pv$). This results in the final energy term carried by the mass flow being a combination of $h + ke + pe$.

An example of **isochoric (constant volume) cooling** of **air** in a **rigid, impermeable container** is solved. The goal is to determine the final temperature ($T_2$) and the heat transferred out ($Q_{out}$). The First Law simplifies to $\\Delta U = -Q_{out}$ because for an **isochoric process, work is zero** ($W_{in} = W_{out} = 0$). For an ideal gas, the **change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) depends only on temperature**. Using the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$)**, the relation is $m c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{out}$. The **ideal gas equation** ($p v = R T$) is then used to compute the state properties needed to find $T_2$ and $Q_{out}$.

By applying the **First Law of Thermodynamics** ($\\\\Delta U = Q_{net, in} - W_{net, out}$) to a cycle, and recognizing that the **change in internal energy ($\\\\Delta U$) is zero** (since the system returns to its initial state), the lecturer concludes that the **net work output must equal the net heat input ($W_{net, out} = Q_{net, in}$)**. This relationship is a fundamental concept for analyzing engines and other cyclic devices.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle and Reversed Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)

The segment reviews the \\textbf{Carnot Cycle}, noting it operates between two temperatures ($T_H$ and $T_L$) and features four fully \\textbf{reversible} processes: two isothermal heat transfers and two adiabatic (isentropic) work transfers. Running the cycle in \\textbf{reverse} transforms it from a thermal engine (clockwise) into a \\textbf{heat pump} or refrigerator (counterclockwise), which pumps heat from the low-temperature reservoir ($T_L$) to the high-temperature reservoir ($T_H$). The \\textbf{First Law of Thermodynamics} for a cycle dictates that $\\Delta U = 0$, meaning the \\textbf{net work out} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) must equal the \\textbf{net heat in} ($Q_{\\text{net,in}}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Steam Power Plant: Worked Out Problem
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-2.0 (Time: 02:31 - 13:38)

The instructor analyzes a \\textbf{thermoelectric power plant} cycle consisting of a \\textbf{pump} ($W_{\\text{in}}$), a \\textbf{boiler} ($Q_{\\text{in}}$), a \\textbf{turbine} ($W_{\\text{out}}$), and a \\textbf{condenser} ($Q_{\\text{out}}$). For the steady-state cycle, the \\textbf{First Law} is applied, where $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{net,in}}$. The \\textbf{net power output} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) is calculated using the given heat rates, accounting for losses ($Q_{\\text{loss}}$): $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{in}} - (Q_{\\text{out}} + Q_{\\text{loss}})$. With $Q_{\\text{in}} = 280 \\text{ GJ/h}$, $Q_{\\text{out}} = 165 \\text{ GJ/h}$, and $Q_{\\text{loss}} = 8 \\text{ GJ/h}$, the net power output is $107 \\text{ GJ/h}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Deriving the Efficiency of an Ideal Gas Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-3.0 (Time: 13:39 - 33:21)
**Content Summary:**
This segment is dedicated to \\textbf{deriving the maximum theoretical efficiency ($\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}}$)} of a heat engine based on the reversible \\textbf{Carnot Cycle}, using the assumption of an \\textbf{ideal gas} as the working fluid. The work and heat transfer for the isothermal processes are derived using the boundary work definition ($\\delta W = P dV$) and the ideal gas law ($PV = RT$), resulting in the form $W = Q = R T \\ln(\\frac{V_{\\text{final}}}{V_{\\text{initial}}})$. The key step involves showing that the volume ratios for the isothermal processes are related by the adiabatic processes: $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{V_3}{V_4}$. This leads to the final expression for the \\textbf{Carnot efficiency}, which is independent of the working fluid's properties and depends only on the absolute temperatures of the reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Refrigeration Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-4.0 (Time: 33:22 - 47:28)
**Content Summary:**
This segment defines the performance measures for devices that run the Carnot cycle in reverse: \\textbf{refrigerators} and \\textbf{heat pumps}. The measure of performance is the \\textbf{Coefficient of Performance (COP)}. For a refrigerator, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_R = \\frac{Q_L}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired cooling over cost). For a heat pump, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\frac{Q_H}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired heating over cost). Using the First Law ($Q_H = Q_L + W_{\\text{net,in}}$), the relationship $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\text{COP}_R + 1}$ is established. The \\textbf{Maximum (Carnot) COPs} are introduced, which depend only on the absolute temperatures $T_H$ and $T_L$: $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{R, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_L}{T_H - T_L}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_H}{T_H - T_L}}$.

This leads to the definition of **enthalpy ($H$)** as the combination of **internal energy ($U$)** and **flow work ($PV$)**. The use of **specific enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)** is justified because it greatly simplifies the **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)** by combining the internal energy and flow work into a single property.

The equation is then applied to various **steady-flow devices** such as turbines, compressors, nozzles, diffusers, throttling valves, and heat exchangers, with the necessary **simplifying assumptions** outlined for each. The core of the segment is an **example problem involving an air turbine**. The problem is solved to find the exit temperature ($T_2$) by applying the simplified SFEE, $\\dot{W}_{out} = \\dot{m} (h_1 - h_2)$, and using enthalpy values from tables. An alternative solution is demonstrated using the **ideal gas approximation** where the change in enthalpy is $\\Delta h = C_p \\Delta T$, and its precision relative to the table method is discussed.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Determine the properties of water at 200 deg. C and 150 kPa

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Throttling and Expansion Valves
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on **throttling valves/expansion valves** within a refrigeration cycle, emphasizing that it is an **isenthalpic process** ($\\mathbf{h_{\\text{in}} = h_{\\text{out}}}$). This condition is met by assuming **no work** and **no heat transfer** (adiabatic/insulated, which is valid for a small orifice or porous plug). This expansion causes a temperature decrease, known as the **Joule-Thompson effect**. The process is visualized on a **pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram**, where a saturated liquid at high pressure ($x=0$) expands along a constant enthalpy line into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture at lower pressure.

**Video Key:** Fa25-L5c-2.0 (Time: 19:46 - 41:14)
**Content Summary:**
The segment analyzes a **heat exchanger** under **Steady-Flow Energy Analysis (SFEA)**. The overall energy balance for the adiabatic heat exchanger simplifies to $\\mathbf{\\sum \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} h_{\\text{in}} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} h_{\\text{out}}}$. Applying this to the two streams (refrigerant, $R$, and water, $w$): $\\mathbf{\\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2) = \\dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$. The problem involves determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water ($\\dot{m}_w$) and the heat transfer rate from the refrigerant to the water ($\\mathbf{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{out}} = \\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2)}$), which is also equal to the heat gained by the water ($\\mathbf{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$).

This section covers the formal statements of the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: the **Kelvin-Planck Statement** (impossibility of PMM2) and the **Clausius Statement** (impossibility of spontaneous heat transfer from cold to hot). The segment then introduces the basic components of a **Heat Engine** operating between a high-temperature source ($T_H$) and a low-temperature sink ($T_L$), and defines the **Thermal Efficiency** ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{net,out}}}{Q_H}}$). Using the First Law, the efficiency is also expressed as $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{th}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_L}{Q_H}}$, with the Kelvin-Planck statement confirming that $Q_L$ cannot be zero, making $\\eta_{\\text{th}} < 100\\%$.

**Content Summary:**
This segment discusses the theoretical limit of energy conversion, linking the impossibility of a **Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind (PMM2)** to the need for a fully **reversible cycle**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-5.0 (Time: 15:11 - 24:09)
**Content Summary:**
This final segment establishes the two **Carnot Principles**: 1) The efficiency of an irreversible engine is always less than that of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{irr}} < \\eta_{\\text{rev}}}$). 2) All reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs have the same efficiency ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{rev,A}} = \\eta_{\\text{rev,B}}}$). This leads to the derivation of the **Carnot Thermal Efficiency** formula, which depends only on the absolute temperatures of the hot ($T_H$) and cold ($T_L$) reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_L}{T_H}}$.

**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass that does not cross the boundary), the **First Law of Thermodynamics** states that the only two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. This is the fundamental definition of a closed system. The **direction of heat transfer** is determined *only* by the **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)**, moving from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. Conversely, **work** is any energy transfer mechanism *other than* heat.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Terminology
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-8.0 (Time: 20:03 - 21:05)
**Content Summary:**
An **adiabatic process** is one in which there is absolutely **no heat transfer** ($Q=0$). This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer by work to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-9.0 (Time: 21:06 - 29:42)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-10.0 (Time: 29:43 - 32:59)
**Content Summary:**
The section summarizes the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a **closed system** as $\\Delta U = Q_{in} - W_{out}$. This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\\Delta U = Q$.

This section solves an energy balance problem (a paddle work example) by applying the **First Law of Thermodynamics** to a **closed system**. The problem involves **shaft work input** ($W_{in}$) from a paddle wheel and **heat output** ($Q_{out}$) to the surroundings. The change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) is calculated using the form $\\mathbf{U_2 - U_1 = W_{in} - Q_{out}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Mechanisms of Energy Transfer For a Closed System
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-12.0 (Time: 43:07 - 46:19)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\\\mathbf{\\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$). This emphasizes that work and heat are **path functions**, while internal energy is a **property** (state function).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Electric heating of water vapor at constant pressure
**Source:** Energy Analysis of Closed Systems (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L4c-1.0 (Time: 00:29 - 19:46)
**Content Summary:**
This segment introduces and solves an **energy balance problem for a closed system** (fixed mass) involving water vapor in a piston-cylinder device. The process involves **electrical work transferred in ($W_{e, in}$) and heat transfer ($Q$)** while the system is maintained at **constant pressure**. The key theoretical derivation shows that for a constant pressure closed system, the boundary work can be absorbed into the internal energy term ($U$), resulting in a simplified energy balance where $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = \Delta H$ (or $Q_{net, in} + W_{e, in} = m \\\\Delta h$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Introduction to Entropy ($S$).
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-1.0 (Time: 00:00 - 04:06)
**Content Summary:**
The lecture begins by introducing the concept of \\textbf{entropy} ($S$) and its utility in \\textbf{isentropic processes}. The instructor notes that entropy is a weird thing that cannot be directly measured. The \\textbf{Temperature-Entropy (TS) diagram} is introduced as a more useful tool than the Pressure-Volume (PV) diagram for analyzing \\textbf{power cycles}. The four-step \\textbf{Carnot cycle} (two isothermal, two isentropic processes) is illustrated on the TS diagram, where the area enclosed represents the \\textbf{net heat in} (which equals the \\textbf{net work out}) for the cycle. Entropy is presented as a helpful compass to guide process analysis and determine power output.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Change in Entropy in Thermal Conduction
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-2.0 (Time: 04:07 - 18:07)
**Content Summary:**
This segment analyzes the \\textbf{change in entropy} during \\textbf{thermal conduction} between two \\textbf{thermal reservoirs} (one hot, $T_1$, one cold, $T_2$) that transfer a heat magnitude $Q$. The fundamental equation for change in entropy is introduced: $\\mathbf{dS = \\delta Q/T}$. The units for entropy ($S$) are $\\text{kJ}/\\text{K}$ and specific entropy ($s$) are $\\text{kJ}/(\\text{kg}\\cdot \\text{K})$. The change in entropy for each control volume (CV) is calculated: $\\Delta S_1 = -Q/T_1$ (entropy decreases for the hot reservoir) and $\\Delta S_2 = +Q/T_2$ (entropy increases for the cold reservoir). The \\textbf{total entropy change of the system} is derived as $\\mathbf{\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = Q(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}$. The condition for a \\textbf{reversible process} is defined as $\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = 0$, which would only occur if $T_1 = T_2$. Since $T_1 > T_2$, the key takeaway is that the entropy of an isolated system must either remain constant (reversible) or \\textbf{increase} (irreversible/spontaneous heat flow), confirming the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

**Content Summary:**
The segment begins a detailed \\textbf{example problem} to calculate the entropy change for \\textbf{pure water} in an \\textbf{isobaric (constant pressure)} process within a piston-cylinder device. The process is depicted on a TS diagram, starting at State 1 as a \\textbf{compressed liquid} ($P_1 = 140 \\text{ kPa}$, $T_1 = 20^\\circ \\text{C}$) and moving toward a superheated vapor state. The instructor first determines the initial properties, including $s_1$ and $h_1$. A \\textbf{First Law energy balance} is applied to the closed system (piston-cylinder): $\\mathbf{\\Delta U = Q_{\\text{in}} - W_{\\text{out}}}$ (neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy). The \\textbf{work out} is calculated for the constant pressure process as $W_{\\text{out}} = P(V_2 - V_1)$ or $m P(v_2 - v_1)$. By manipulating the energy balance, the relationship $\\mathbf{Q_{\\text{in}} = \\Delta H}$ (change in enthalpy) is established, which simplifies the analysis. The video captions end mid-solution.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Comparing Control Volumes: Open vs. Closed System
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
Before proceeding with entropy analysis, the lecture briefly reviews the two primary system types: **closed systems** (e.g., piston-cylinders) and **open systems** (control volumes). A **closed system** does not exchange mass, only heat or work. An **open system** (control volume) allows for mass transfer, which also carries energy into or out of the system. The energy analysis for closed systems typically involves changes in internal energy ($\\Delta U$), while open systems are often analyzed using **rate notation** ($\\dot{W}, \\dot{Q}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Multisage Compressor With Cooling
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Time: 02:53 - 26:34)
**Content Summary:**
The section begins by comparing the work produced in a closed system (**$P\\text{d}V$**) versus an open system (**$V\\text{d}P$**). The main topic then shifts to designing more **efficient compressor systems** using a two-stage compression process with an **intercooler** between the stages. The logic is that compressing a hot gas requires more work, so cooling the gas (intercooling) after the first stage makes the second stage of compression easier, thereby **reducing the total work input**. The T-s diagram is used to illustrate the process, showing that the intercooling stage involves **taking heat out** of the system, which results in a **decrease in entropy**. A quantitative example is solved for a multi-stage compressor with air.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 26:35 - 33:54)
**Content Summary:**
The general **rate form of the entropy balance (Second Law)** is developed: $\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\sum \\frac{\\dot{Q}_k}{T_k} + \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i - \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e + \\dot{S}_{gen}$. The key difference from the First Law, which is an energy balance, is the presence of the **rate of entropy generation ($\\dot{S}_{gen}$)**, as entropy can be created but not destroyed. The lecture then applies the balance to an **Adiabatic, Steady Flow Heat Exchanger** (where $\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$ and $\\dot{Q}=0$), which simplifies to $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\sum \\dot{m}_e s_e - \\sum \\dot{m}_i s_i$. This simplified form, $\\dot{S}_{gen} = \\dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \\dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$, sets up the next example problem.

An **isentropic process** is defined by the conditions of being **adiabatic (no heat transfer)** and operating **reversibly (no friction)**. A process that is only reversible but includes heat transfer is termed **internally reversible**. Since **entropy is a property**, in an isentropic steady flow device, the **specific entropy remains constant** ($s_{in} = s_{out}$). This condition provides the **theoretical limit of performance** and simplifies power plant analysis.

Two TdS relations are established: $TdS = dU + PdV$ and $TdS = dH - VdP$. Applying the **ideal gas law** and setting $dS=0$ for an isentropic process (assuming constant specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$), the derivation results in the power-law relationships between state variables (T, P, V), which are simplified using the **adiabatic index $\\kappa = C_p/C_v$** to the common forms.

**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-2.0 (Time: 11:14 - 28:44)
**Content Summary:**
This section is dedicated to developing the **Conservation of Mass Principle** for a **Control Volume (CV)**. The derivation uses the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** to relate the time rate of change of mass in the system to the change of mass within the CV plus the net mass flow across the boundaries. The final result is the rate form of the mass balance equation: $\\\\frac{dM_{CV}}{dt} = \\\\sum_{in} \\\\dot{m}_{in} - \\\\sum_{out} \\\\dot{m}_{out}$. The lecturer then simplifies this for **steady flow**, where the mass of the CV is constant, leading to the condition that the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out: $\\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{in} = \\\\sum \\\\dot{m}_{out}$.

A crucial step is the separation of **total work** into **flow work (\\\\dot{W}_{flow})** and **shaft work (\\\\dot{W}_{shaft})**. The derivation then introduces the property of **enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)**, which conveniently combines the internal energy ($u$) carried by the mass flow with the necessary flow work ($Pv$). This results in the final energy term carried by the mass flow being a combination of $h + ke + pe$.

The effect of **rapid stretching** is discussed, noting it causes the system to **warm up** due to a sudden reduction of **entropy**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Isochoric cooling example
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
An example of **isochoric (constant volume) cooling** of **air** in a **rigid, impermeable container** is solved. The goal is to determine the final temperature ($T_2$) and the heat transferred out ($Q_{out}$). The First Law simplifies to $\\Delta U = -Q_{out}$ because for an **isochoric process, work is zero** ($W_{in} = W_{out} = 0$). For an ideal gas, the **change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) depends only on temperature**. Using the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$)**, the relation is $m c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{out}$. The **ideal gas equation** ($p v = R T$) is then used to compute the state properties needed to find $T_2$ and $Q_{out}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Thermodynamics
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-3.0 (Time: 03:00 - 06:12)
**Content Summary:**
Thermodynamics is introduced as the **science of energies**, historically focused on converting **heat to work** and vice-versa. The field's origin is traced to **Sadi Carnot** in the 19th century, whose work on engine efficiency contributed to the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, and to **Julius Robert von Mayer** (a physician), who developed the idea of the **First Law**. The term thermodynamics comes from Greek/Latin for heat and power. While the field has branched into chemistry and information theory, the course will retain the focus on **mechanical work** and treat systems as a **continuum**, consistent with the axiom of **conservation of energy**. The microscopic view of disordered atomic motion is left to courses like statistical mechanics.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Thermodynamic Postulates and Systems
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-4.0 (Time: 06:13 - 08:31)
**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on the **postulate-based approach** of thermodynamics and the critical first step in problem-solving: defining a **volume/boundary** where **heat and work interactions** occur. It introduces the concept of an **equation of state**, explaining that if one can measure a sufficient number of **independent properties** (typically two), all other properties of the system can be determined. This principle is illustrated using the **Ideal Gas Law** ($P=f(V,T)$), where knowing two independent properties provides **complete information** about the system's state.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Independent and Dependent Properties
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-5.0 (Time: 08:32 - 13:29)
**Content Summary:**
This section uses **multivariable calculus** to illustrate the relationship between **two independent properties** ($X_1, X_2$) and the resulting **dependent property** ($X_3$), emphasizing that fixing $X_1$ and $X_2$ defines a specific point on a surface, which also yields information about the **derivatives** (rate of change). This principle is valid for a **pure substance** (like nitrogen or air, but not air with condensed liquid oxygen). The lecture connects this to the **pyCalor Python module**, where defining the substance and **two independent properties** creates a state object ($\text{ST}$) from which all other properties (e.g., $\text{ST.U}$) can be calculated, thereby simplifying complex calculations in a cycle (e.g., using a PV diagram).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-6.0 (Time: 13:30 - 20:27)

The discussion emphasizes that thermodynamics is interested in **changes in energy** from a **reference state**, not absolute values. **Little $u$** ($u$) is defined as **internal energy per mass** (J/kg) for a **simplified system** where motion, gravity, and external fields are **neglected**. In this case, $u$ depends only on two independent properties (e.g., T and specific volume), allowing its values to be **tabulated** (or calculated by pyCalor). **Big $U$** ($U$) is the **total internal energy** (Joules).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Determining the properties of nitrogen
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)

The instructor returns to the concept that **two independent properties** ($X_1, X_2$) provide complete information about a system's state. Using a plot of **Internal Energy ($U$) vs. Specific Volume ($v$) and entropy ($S$)**, the lecture demonstrates how to determine other properties using **derivatives**. Specifically, the **derivative** of $U$ with respect to $v$ at constant $S$ yields **pressure (P)**, and the derivative of $U$ with respect to $S$ at constant $v$ yields **temperature (T)**. This illustrates that once the point is defined by $X_1$ and $X_2$, all other properties follow from mathematical relations.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Steam Power Plant: Worked Out Problem
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-2.0 (Time: 02:31 - 13:38)

The instructor analyzes a \\textbf{thermoelectric power plant} cycle consisting of a \\textbf{pump} ($W_{\\text{in}}$), a \\textbf{boiler} ($Q_{\\text{in}}$), a \\textbf{turbine} ($W_{\\text{out}}$), and a \\textbf{condenser} ($Q_{\\text{out}}$). For the steady-state cycle, the \\textbf{First Law} is applied, where $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{net,in}}$. The \\textbf{net power output} ($W_{\\text{net,out}}$) is calculated using the given heat rates, accounting for losses ($Q_{\\text{loss}}$): $W_{\\text{net,out}} = Q_{\\text{in}} - (Q_{\\text{out}} + Q_{\\text{loss}})$. With $Q_{\\text{in}} = 280 \\text{ GJ/h}$, $Q_{\\text{out}} = 165 \\text{ GJ/h}$, and $Q_{\\text{loss}} = 8 \\text{ GJ/h}$, the net power output is $107 \\text{ GJ/h}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Deriving the Efficiency of an Ideal Gas Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-3.0 (Time: 13:39 - 33:21)
**Content Summary:**
This segment is dedicated to \\textbf{deriving the maximum theoretical efficiency ($\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}}$)} of a heat engine based on the reversible \\textbf{Carnot Cycle}, using the assumption of an \\textbf{ideal gas} as the working fluid. The work and heat transfer for the isothermal processes are derived using the boundary work definition ($\\delta W = P dV$) and the ideal gas law ($PV = RT$), resulting in the form $W = Q = R T \\ln(\\frac{V_{\\text{final}}}{V_{\\text{initial}}})$. The key step involves showing that the volume ratios for the isothermal processes are related by the adiabatic processes: $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{V_3}{V_4}$. This leads to the final expression for the \\textbf{Carnot efficiency}, which is independent of the working fluid's properties and depends only on the absolute temperatures of the reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Refrigeration Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-4.0 (Time: 33:22 - 47:28)
**Content Summary:**
This segment defines the performance measures for devices that run the Carnot cycle in reverse: \\textbf{refrigerators} and \\textbf{heat pumps}. The measure of performance is the \\textbf{Coefficient of Performance (COP)}. For a refrigerator, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_R = \\frac{Q_L}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired cooling over cost). For a heat pump, $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\frac{Q_H}{W_{\\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired heating over cost). Using the First Law ($Q_H = Q_L + W_{\\text{net,in}}$), the relationship $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP} = \\text{COP}_R + 1}$ is established. The \\textbf{Maximum (Carnot) COPs} are introduced, which depend only on the absolute temperatures $T_H$ and $T_L$: $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{R, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_L}{T_H - T_L}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\text{COP}_{HP, \\text{Carnot}} = \\frac{T_H}{T_H - T_L}}$.

This segment continues the discussion on **mass and energy analysis for control volumes** and **steady-flow devices**. The lecturer reviews the concept of **flow work**, which is the work required to push a fluid into or out of a control volume, illustrated by an imaginary piston at the inlet/outlet. This leads to the definition of **enthalpy ($H$)** as the combination of **internal energy ($U$)** and **flow work ($PV$)**. The use of **specific enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)** is justified because it greatly simplifies the **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)** by combining the internal energy and flow work into a single property.

The problem is solved to find the exit temperature ($T_2$) by applying the simplified SFEE, $\\dot{W}_{out} = \\dot{m} (h_1 - h_2)$, and using enthalpy values from tables. An alternative solution is demonstrated using the **ideal gas approximation** where the change in enthalpy is $\\Delta h = C_p \\Delta T$, and its precision relative to the table method is discussed.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Determine the properties of water at 200 deg. C and 150 kPa
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-7.0 (Time: 29:20 - 30:45)
**Content Summary:**
The segment introduces an example problem to **determine the properties of water** given the input of **temperature ($T=200^{\\circ}\\text{C}$) and pressure ($P=150\\text{ kPa}$)**. The lecturer notes that these are **independent properties** because the state is *not* in the saturated liquid-vapor region. It is hypothesized that the state is a **superheated vapor** due to the high temperature.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Throttling and Expansion Valves
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on **throttling valves/expansion valves** within a refrigeration cycle, emphasizing that it is an **isenthalpic process** ($\\mathbf{h_{\\text{in}} = h_{\\text{out}}}$). This condition is met by assuming **no work** and **no heat transfer** (adiabatic/insulated, which is valid for a small orifice or porous plug). This expansion causes a temperature decrease, known as the **Joule-Thompson effect**. The process is visualized on a **pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram**, where a saturated liquid at high pressure ($x=0$) expands along a constant enthalpy line into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture at lower pressure.

The overall energy balance for the adiabatic heat exchanger simplifies to $\\mathbf{\\sum \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} h_{\\text{in}} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} h_{\\text{out}}}$. Applying this to the two streams (refrigerant, $R$, and water, $w$): $\\mathbf{\\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2) = \\dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$. The problem involves determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water ($\\dot{m}_w$) and the heat transfer rate from the refrigerant to the water ($\\mathbf{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{out}} = \\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2)}$), which is also equal to the heat gained by the water ($\\mathbf{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$).

The segment introduces the **Kelvin Statement** of the Second Law, asserting the impossibility of a cyclic device producing net work solely by extracting heat ($Q$) from a single thermal reservoir ($T$). The instructor illustrates this concept with a diagram of a heat reservoir at temperature $T$ and a piston/engine, characterizing this theoretical device as a **Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind (PMM2)** and confirming its impossibility. The process described is isothermal expansion.

**Content Summary:**
This segment discusses the theoretical limit of energy conversion, linking the impossibility of a **Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind (PMM2)** to the need for a fully **reversible cycle**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-5.0 (Time: 15:11 - 24:09)
**Content Summary:**
This final segment establishes the two **Carnot Principles**: 1) The efficiency of an irreversible engine is always less than that of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{irr}} < \\eta_{\\text{rev}}}$). 2) All reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs have the same efficiency ($\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{rev,A}} = \\eta_{\\text{rev,B}}}$). This leads to the derivation of the **Carnot Thermal Efficiency** formula, which depends only on the absolute temperatures of the hot ($T_H$) and cold ($T_L$) reservoirs: $\\mathbf{\\eta_{\\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \\frac{T_L}{T_H}}$.

**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass that does not cross the boundary), the **First Law of Thermodynamics** states that the only two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. This is the fundamental definition of a closed system. The **direction of heat transfer** is determined *only* by the **temperature difference ($\Delta T$)**, moving from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. Conversely, **work** is any energy transfer mechanism *other than* heat.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Terminology
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-8.0 (Time: 20:03 - 21:05)
**Content Summary:**
An **adiabatic process** is one in which there is absolutely **no heat transfer** ($Q=0$). This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer by work to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-9.0 (Time: 21:06 - 29:42)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-10.0 (Time: 29:43 - 32:59)
**Content Summary:**
The section summarizes the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a **closed system** as $\Delta U = Q_{in} - W_{out}$. This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\Delta U = Q$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Mechanisms of Energy Transfer For a Closed System
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-12.0 (Time: 43:07 - 46:19)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\mathbf{\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$). This emphasizes that work and heat are **path functions**, while internal energy is a **property** (state function).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Introduction to Entropy ($S$).
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-1.0 (Time: 00:00 - 04:06)
**Content Summary:**
The lecture begins by introducing the concept of \textbf{entropy} ($S$) and its utility in \textbf{isentropic processes}. The instructor notes that entropy is a weird thing that cannot be directly measured. The \textbf{Temperature-Entropy (TS) diagram} is introduced as a more useful tool than the Pressure-Volume (PV) diagram for analyzing \textbf{power cycles}. The four-step \textbf{Carnot cycle} (two isothermal, two isentropic processes) is illustrated on the TS diagram, where the area enclosed represents the \textbf{net heat in} (which equals the \textbf{net work out}) for the cycle. Entropy is presented as a helpful compass to guide process analysis and determine power output.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Change in Entropy in Thermal Conduction
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-2.0 (Time: 04:07 - 18:07)
**Content Summary:**
This segment analyzes the \textbf{change in entropy} during \textbf{thermal conduction} between two \textbf{thermal reservoirs} (one hot, $T_1$, one cold, $T_2$) that transfer a heat magnitude $Q$. The fundamental equation for change in entropy is introduced: $\mathbf{dS = \delta Q/T}$. The units for entropy ($S$) are $\text{kJ}/\text{K}$ and specific entropy ($s$) are $\text{kJ}/(\text{kg}\cdot \text{K})$. The change in entropy for each control volume (CV) is calculated: $\Delta S_1 = -Q/T_1$ (entropy decreases for the hot reservoir) and $\Delta S_2 = +Q/T_2$ (entropy increases for the cold reservoir). The \textbf{total entropy change of the system} is derived as $\mathbf{\Delta S_{\text{total}} = Q(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}$. The condition for a \textbf{reversible process} is defined as $\Delta S_{\text{total}} = 0$, which would only occur if $T_1 = T_2$. Since $T_1 > T_2$, the key takeaway is that the entropy of an isolated system must either remain constant (reversible) or \textbf{increase} (irreversible/spontaneous heat flow), confirming the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-3.0 (Time: 18:08 - 19:52)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a conceptual transition, reminding the class that \textbf{entropy ($S$) is a thermodynamic property} like internal energy ($U$) or enthalpy ($H$). For a pure substance, determining two independent properties provides complete information, including the value of specific entropy ($s$). The instructor reinforces the importance of \textbf{TS (Temperature-Entropy) diagrams} for analyzing power and gas cycles and emphasizes that entropy is \textbf{not a path function}. The discussion concludes with a reflection on the formula $\mathbf{dS = \delta Q / T}$, which implies that energy has a value or quality (the essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Example: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-4.0 (Time: 19:53 - 35:06)
**Content Summary:**
The segment begins a detailed \textbf{example problem} to calculate the entropy change for \textbf{pure water} in an \textbf{isobaric (constant pressure)} process within a piston-cylinder device. The process is depicted on a TS diagram, starting at State 1 as a \textbf{compressed liquid} ($P_1 = 140 \text{ kPa}$, $T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C}$) and moving toward a superheated vapor state. The instructor first determines the initial properties, including $s_1$ and $h_1$. A \textbf{First Law energy balance} is applied to the closed system (piston-cylinder): $\mathbf{\Delta U = Q_{\text{in}} - W_{\text{out}}}$ (neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy). The \textbf{work out} is calculated for the constant pressure process as $W_{\text{out}} = P(V_2 - V_1)$ or $m P(v_2 - v_1)$. By manipulating the energy balance, the relationship $\mathbf{Q_{\text{in}} = \Delta H}$ (change in enthalpy) is established, which simplifies the analysis. The video captions end mid-solution.

**Content Summary:**
Data centers, particularly those powering **large language models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT, represent a rapidly growing area of energy consumption, with a single large center consuming power equivalent to a small town. The primary challenge is managing the tremendous amount of waste **heat** generated by the servers, which is currently removed by power-intensive **chillers** (large air conditioners). This high-density energy challenge necessitates innovative thermal management strategies, such as **liquid cooling**, where servers are submerged in dielectric fluids. Furthermore, the intermittent nature of renewable energy (solar and wind) drives the need for **thermal and battery storage**. For data centers, **cold thermal storage** is highlighted as a solution to run chillers during off-peak hours (at night) when electricity is cheaper, storing the cold for use during the day.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Comparing Control Volumes: Open vs. Closed System
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-2.0 (Time: 01:56 - 2:52)
**Content Summary:**
Before proceeding with entropy analysis, the lecture briefly reviews the two primary system types: **closed systems** (e.g., piston-cylinders) and **open systems** (control volumes). A **closed system** does not exchange mass, only heat or work. An **open system** (control volume) allows for mass transfer, which also carries energy into or out of the system. The energy analysis for closed systems typically involves changes in internal energy ($\Delta U$), while open systems are often analyzed using **rate notation** ($\dot{W}, \dot{Q}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Multisage Compressor With Cooling
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Time: 02:53 - 26:34)
**Content Summary:**
The section begins by comparing the work produced in a closed system (**$P\text{d}V$**) versus an open system (**$V\text{d}P$**). The main topic then shifts to designing more **efficient compressor systems** using a two-stage compression process with an **intercooler** between the stages. The logic is that compressing a hot gas requires more work, so cooling the gas (intercooling) after the first stage makes the second stage of compression easier, thereby **reducing the total work input**. The T-s diagram is used to illustrate the process, showing that the intercooling stage involves **taking heat out** of the system, which results in a **decrease in entropy**. A quantitative example is solved for a multi-stage compressor with air.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 26:35 - 33:54)
**Content Summary:**
The general **rate form of the entropy balance (Second Law)** is developed: $\frac{dS}{dt} = \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_k}{T_k} + \sum \dot{m}_i s_i - \sum \dot{m}_e s_e + \dot{S}_{gen}$. The key difference from the First Law, which is an energy balance, is the presence of the **rate of entropy generation ($\dot{S}_{gen}$)**, as entropy can be created but not destroyed. The lecture then applies the balance to an **Adiabatic, Steady Flow Heat Exchanger** (where $\frac{dS}{dt}=0$ and $\dot{Q}=0$), which simplifies to $\dot{S}_{gen} = \sum \dot{m}_e s_e - \sum \dot{m}_i s_i$. This simplified form, $\dot{S}_{gen} = \dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$, sets up the next example problem.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Isentropic process
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-2.0 (Time: 00:27 - 2:52)
**Content Summary:**
An **isentropic process** is defined by the conditions of being **adiabatic (no heat transfer)** and operating **reversibly (no friction)**. A process that is only reversible but includes heat transfer is termed **internally reversible**. Since **entropy is a property**, in an isentropic steady flow device, the **specific entropy remains constant** ($s_{in} = s_{out}$). This condition provides the **theoretical limit of performance** and simplifies power plant analysis.

The **isentropic turbine example** (reversible and adiabatic) calculates the **work output per unit mass** ($w_{out}$). By applying the **First Law for a steady-flow device** (neglecting kinetic/potential energy and heat), $w_{out}$ simplifies to the **difference in specific enthalpy** ($\Delta h$). The isentropic condition ($s_1 = s_2$) allows the unknown outlet enthalpy ($h_2$) to be determined using the given outlet pressure ($P_2$) and the known inlet entropy ($s_1$). The final work output value is stated as **350 kJ/kg**, demonstrating how entropy simplifies the calculation of **maximum performance**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Differential entropy change relations
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The lecture derives **differential entropy change (TdS) relations** for an **ideal gas** to analyze isentropic devices (like compressors) without property tables. Two TdS relations are established: $TdS = dU + PdV$ and $TdS = dH - VdP$. Applying the **ideal gas law** and setting $dS=0$ for an isentropic process (assuming constant specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$), the derivation results in the power-law relationships between state variables (T, P, V), which are simplified using the **adiabatic index $\kappa = C_p/C_v$** to the common forms.

This segment completes an **example problem for a closed system** (the cooling of a solid block) that was introduced in a previous lecture. The problem involves a hot piece of iron dropped into a cold water bath. The overall process is treated as **adiabatic** with **no work exchange**. The core principle applied is the **conservation of energy** for the combined system, stating that the change in the system's **internal energy** is zero ($\Delta U = 0$). The goal is to determine the final equilibrium temperature ($T_2$) by summing the change in internal energy for the iron and the water, using the approximation $\Delta U \approx m C \Delta T$.

This section is dedicated to developing the **Conservation of Mass Principle** for a **Control Volume (CV)**. The derivation uses the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** to relate the time rate of change of mass in the system to the change of mass within the CV plus the net mass flow across the boundaries. The final result is the rate form of the mass balance equation: $\frac{dM_{CV}}{dt} = \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} - \sum_{out} \dot{m}_{out}$. The lecturer then simplifies this for **steady flow**, where the mass of the CV is constant, leading to the condition that the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out: $\sum \dot{m}_{in} = \sum \dot{m}_{out}$.

**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-3.0 (Time: 28:45 - 40:34)
**Content Summary:**
The focus shifts to developing the **Conservation of Energy Equation** for a **Control Volume**. This analysis accounts for energy transfer via heat, work, and mass flow. A crucial step is the separation of **total work** into **flow work (\dot{W}_{flow})** and **shaft work (\dot{W}_{shaft})**. The derivation then introduces the property of **enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)**, which conveniently combines the internal energy ($u$) carried by the mass flow with the necessary flow work ($Pv$). This results in the final energy term carried by the mass flow being a combination of $h + ke + pe$.

The final work output is calculated using the property values obtained from steam tables (pyCalor).

**Content Summary:**
An example of **isochoric (constant volume) cooling** of **air** in a **rigid, impermeable container** is solved. The goal is to determine the final temperature ($T_2$) and the heat transferred out ($Q_{out}$). The First Law simplifies to $\Delta U = -Q_{out}$ because for an **isochoric process, work is zero** ($W_{in} = W_{out} = 0$). For an ideal gas, the **change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) depends only on temperature**. Using the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$)**, the relation is $m c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{out}$. The **ideal gas equation** ($p v = R T$) is then used to compute the state properties needed to find $T_2$ and $Q_{out}$.

By applying the **First Law of Thermodynamics** ($\Delta U = Q_{net, in} - W_{net, out}$) to a cycle, and recognizing that the **change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) is zero** (since the system returns to its initial state), the lecturer concludes that the **net work output must equal the net heat input ($W_{net, out} = Q_{net, in}$)**. This relationship is a fundamental concept for analyzing engines and other cyclic devices.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Thermodynamic Postulates and Systems
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-4.0 (Time: 06:13 - 08:31)
**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on the **postulate-based approach** of thermodynamics and the critical first step in problem-solving: defining a **volume/boundary** where **heat and work interactions** occur. It introduces the concept of an **equation of state**, explaining that if one can measure a sufficient number of **independent properties** (typically two), all other properties of the system can be determined. This principle is illustrated using the **Ideal Gas Law** ($P=f(V,T)$), where knowing two independent properties provides **complete information** about the system's state.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Independent and Dependent Properties
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-5.0 (Time: 08:32 - 13:29)
**Content Summary:**
This section uses **multivariable calculus** to illustrate the relationship between **two independent properties** ($X_1, X_2$) and the resulting **dependent property** ($X_3$), emphasizing that fixing $X_1$ and $X_2$ defines a specific point on a surface, which also yields information about the **derivatives** (rate of change). This principle is valid for a **pure substance** (like nitrogen or air, but not air with condensed liquid oxygen). The lecture connects this to the **pyCalor Python module**, where defining the substance and **two independent properties** creates a state object ($	ext{ST}$) from which all other properties (e.g., $	ext{ST.U}$) can be calculated, thereby simplifying complex calculations in a cycle (e.g., using a PV diagram).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-6.0 (Time: 13:30 - 20:27)

The discussion emphasizes that thermodynamics is interested in **changes in energy** from a **reference state**, not absolute values. **Little $u$** ($u$) is defined as **internal energy per mass** (J/kg) for a **simplified system** where motion, gravity, and external fields are **neglected**. In this case, $u$ depends only on two independent properties (e.g., T and specific volume), allowing its values to be **tabulated** (or calculated by pyCalor). **Big $U$** ($U$) is the **total internal energy** (Joules).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Determining the properties of nitrogen
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)

The instructor returns to the concept that **two independent properties** ($X_1, X_2$) provide complete information about a system's state. Using a plot of **Internal Energy ($U$) vs. Specific Volume ($v$) and entropy ($S$)**, the lecture demonstrates how to determine other properties using **derivatives**. Specifically, the **derivative** of $U$ with respect to $v$ at constant $S$ yields **pressure (P)**, and the derivative of $U$ with respect to $S$ at constant $v$ yields **temperature (T)**. This illustrates that once the point is defined by $X_1$ and $X_2$, all other properties follow from mathematical relations.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Steam Power Plant: Worked Out Problem
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)

For the steady-state cycle, the \textbf{First Law} is applied, where $W_{\text{net,out}} = Q_{\text{net,in}}$. The \textbf{net power output} ($W_{\text{net,out}}$) is calculated using the given heat rates, accounting for losses ($Q_{\text{loss}}$): $W_{\text{net,out}} = Q_{\text{in}} - (Q_{\text{out}} + Q_{\text{loss}})$. With $Q_{\text{in}} = 280 \text{ GJ/h}$, $Q_{\text{out}} = 165 \text{ GJ/h}$, and $Q_{\text{loss}} = 8 \text{ GJ/h}$, the net power output is $107 \text{ GJ/h}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Deriving the Efficiency of an Ideal Gas Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-3.0 (Time: 13:39 - 33:21)
**Content Summary:**
This segment is dedicated to \textbf{deriving the maximum theoretical efficiency ($\eta_{\text{Carnot}}$)} of a heat engine based on the reversible \textbf{Carnot Cycle}, using the assumption of an \textbf{ideal gas} as the working fluid. The work and heat transfer for the isothermal processes are derived using the boundary work definition ($\delta W = P dV$) and the ideal gas law ($PV = RT$), resulting in the form $W = Q = R T \ln(\frac{V_{\text{final}}}{V_{\text{initial}}})$. The key step involves showing that the volume ratios for the isothermal processes are related by the adiabatic processes: $\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{V_3}{V_4}$. This leads to the final expression for the \textbf{Carnot efficiency}, which is independent of the working fluid's properties and depends only on the absolute temperatures of the reservoirs: $\mathbf{\eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Refrigeration Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
This segment defines the performance measures for devices that run the Carnot cycle in reverse: \textbf{refrigerators} and \textbf{heat pumps}. The measure of performance is the \textbf{Coefficient of Performance (COP)}. For a refrigerator, $\mathbf{\text{COP}_R = \frac{Q_L}{W_{\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired cooling over cost). For a heat pump, $\mathbf{\text{COP}_{HP} = \frac{Q_H}{W_{\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired heating over cost). Using the First Law ($Q_H = Q_L + W_{\text{net,in}}$), the relationship $\mathbf{\text{COP}_{HP} = \text{COP}_R + 1}$ is established. The \textbf{Maximum (Carnot) COPs} are introduced, which depend only on the absolute temperatures $T_H$ and $T_L$: $\mathbf{\text{COP}_{R, \text{Carnot}} = \frac{T_L}{T_H - T_L}}$ and $\mathbf{\text{COP}_{HP, \text{Carnot}} = \frac{T_H}{T_H - T_L}}$.

This segment continues the discussion on **mass and energy analysis for control volumes** and **steady-flow devices**. The lecturer reviews the concept of **flow work**, which is the work required to push a fluid into or out of a control volume, illustrated by an imaginary piston at the inlet/outlet. This leads to the definition of **enthalpy ($H$)** as the combination of **internal energy ($U$)** and **flow work ($PV$)**. The use of **specific enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)** is justified because it greatly simplifies the **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)** by combining the internal energy and flow work into a single property.

The core of the segment is an **example problem involving an air turbine**. The problem is solved to find the exit temperature ($T_2$) by applying the simplified SFEE, $\dot{W}_{out} = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2)$, and using enthalpy values from tables. An alternative solution is demonstrated using the **ideal gas approximation** where the change in enthalpy is $\Delta h = C_p \Delta T$, and its precision relative to the table method is discussed.

**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-1.0 (Time: 00:00 - 00:50)
**Content Summary:**
This segment starts the lecture by stating the current topic is **pure substances**. The lecturer asks students to register on **us.prairietest.com** and then outlines the learning objectives: discussing the concept of a **pure substance**, illustrating it on various **diagrams** to be used throughout the semester, and developing **procedures to determine thermodynamic properties**. The plan is to teach the 'hand tool' (tables) and then show the 'power tool' (computational methods), with the expectation that students will use the power tool.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Pure Substance
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-2.0 (Time: 00:51 - 05:08)
**Content Summary:**
This section explains what a **pure substance** is. A substance must have a **uniform chemical composition throughout**. Examples given are **water** (in multiple phases) and **nitrogen**. The lecture clarifies that a mixture like air is a pure substance, but warns that if one component is condensed out (e.g., **condensing oxygen out of air**), the **ratio is no longer the same**, and it **ceases to be a pure substance**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Phase change processes of pure substances
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-3.0 (Time: 05:09 - 06:32)
**Content Summary:**
This segment introduces the process of **phase change** by discussing the concepts of **compressed liquid, saturated liquid, saturated mixture, saturated vapor, and superheated vapor**. The lecture focuses on how these phases relate to **pressure and temperature** for a pure substance and begins to set up the visualization of this process on a diagram.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: (p,v,T) surface of a pure substance
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-4.0 (Time: 06:33 - 15:50)
**Content Summary:**
This long segment is devoted to illustrating the phase change process using the **Temperature-Specific Volume (T-v) diagram**. The concepts of **isobaric lines (constant pressure lines)** and the **saturated liquid and saturated vapor lines** are introduced, forming the **vapor dome**. The segment discusses the **critical point** where the saturated liquid and saturated vapor states become identical, and it defines the **supercritical fluid region**. It then introduces the **quality ($x$)** property, which is the mass fraction of vapor in the saturated mixture, and explains that $x$ ranges from 0 (saturated liquid) to 1 (saturated vapor).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Property diagrams for phase change processes: Terminology
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-5.0 (Time: 15:51 - 22:29)
**Content Summary:**
This section reinforces the **terminology** used in property diagrams. It defines and locates the **compressed liquid region** (or subcooled liquid), the **saturated liquid-vapor mixture region** (inside the dome), the **superheated vapor region** (outside the dome, right side), and the **supercritical fluid region**. The lecture then introduces the **Pressure-Specific Volume (P-v) diagram**, which also contains the vapor dome, but with **isothermal lines (constant temperature lines)** used for visualization.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Property tables
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-6.0 (Time: 22:30 - 29:19)
**Content Summary:**
This segment explains the **old-fashioned way** of determining properties using **property tables** (like steam tables). The lecturer demonstrates how to use the tables to identify the phase of a substance based on a single given property (e.g., specific volume, $v$) and how to find the corresponding pressure or temperature. The concept of **interpolation** for finding values between those listed in the tables is also introduced, with a mention that this method assumes linearity.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Determine the properties of water at 200 deg. C and 150 kPa
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-7.0 (Time: 29:20 - 30:45)
**Content Summary:**
The segment introduces an example problem to **determine the properties of water** given the input of **temperature ($T=200^{\circ}\text{C}$) and pressure ($P=150\text{ kPa}$)**. The lecturer notes that these are **independent properties** because the state is *not* in the saturated liquid-vapor region. It is hypothesized that the state is a **superheated vapor** due to the high temperature. The segment then shows how to use a computational tool (pyCalor, Python, dot notation) to define a substance object and directly access properties like internal energy ($u$) and specific volume ($v$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Throttling and Expansion Valves
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5c-1.0 (Time: 00:28 - 19:45)
**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on **throttling valves/expansion valves** within a refrigeration cycle, emphasizing that it is an **isenthalpic process** ($\mathbf{h_{\text{in}} = h_{\text{out}}}$). This condition is met by assuming **no work** and **no heat transfer** (adiabatic/insulated, which is valid for a small orifice or porous plug). This expansion causes a temperature decrease, known as the **Joule-Thompson effect**. The process is visualized on a **pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram**, where a saturated liquid at high pressure ($x=0$) expands along a constant enthalpy line into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture at lower pressure.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Heat Exchanger
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5c-2.0 (Time: 19:46 - 41:14)
**Content Summary:**
The segment analyzes a **heat exchanger** under **Steady-Flow Energy Analysis (SFEA)**. The overall energy balance for the adiabatic heat exchanger simplifies to $\mathbf{\sum \dot{m}_{\text{in}} h_{\text{in}} = \sum \dot{m}_{\text{out}} h_{\text{out}}}$. Applying this to the two streams (refrigerant, $R$, and water, $w$): $\mathbf{\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2) = \dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$. The problem involves determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water ($\dot{m}_w$) and the heat transfer rate from the refrigerant to the water ($\mathbf{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2)}$), which is also equal to the heat gained by the water ($\mathbf{\dot{Q}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$).

**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-1.0 (Time: 00:09 - 1:59)
**Content Summary:**
The segment introduces the **Kelvin Statement** of the Second Law, asserting the impossibility of a cyclic device producing net work solely by extracting heat ($Q$) from a single thermal reservoir ($T$). The instructor illustrates this concept with a diagram of a heat reservoir at temperature $T$ and a piston/engine, characterizing this theoretical device as a **Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind (PMM2)** and confirming its impossibility. The process described is isothermal expansion.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Second Law of Thermodynamics
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-2.0 (Time: 02:00 - 10:01)
**Content Summary:**
This section covers the formal statements of the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: the **Kelvin-Planck Statement** (impossibility of PMM2) and the **Clausius Statement** (impossibility of spontaneous heat transfer from cold to hot). The segment then introduces the basic components of a **Heat Engine** operating between a high-temperature source ($T_H$) and a low-temperature sink ($T_L$), and defines the **Thermal Efficiency** ($\mathbf{\eta_{\text{th}} = \frac{W_{\text{net,out}}}{Q_H}}$). Using the First Law, the efficiency is also expressed as $\mathbf{\eta_{\text{th}} = 1 - \frac{Q_L}{Q_H}}$, with the Kelvin-Planck statement confirming that $Q_L$ cannot be zero, making $\eta_{\text{th}} < 100\%$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Perpetual Motion
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-3.0 (Time: 10:02 - 12:36)
**Content Summary:**
This segment discusses the theoretical limit of energy conversion, linking the impossibility of a **Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind (PMM2)** to the need for a fully **reversible cycle**. The **Carnot Cycle** is introduced as the ideal reversible cycle that achieves maximum efficiency. The instructor begins to describe the characteristics of a reversible process, which must be executed infinitely slowly and without any internal or external irreversibilities.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Reversible Processes
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-4.0 (Time: 12:37 - 15:10)
**Content Summary:**
The discussion focuses on **Reversible Processes** as the ideal, theoretical limit for all real-world processes, which are inherently **irreversible**. The instructor identifies common sources of **irreversibility** that prevent a process from being reversible, including **friction**, **unrestrained expansion** (free expansion), **mixing of fluids**, and **heat transfer across a finite temperature difference**. The comparison sets the stage for defining the maximum possible efficiency achievable.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-5.0 (Time: 15:11 - 24:09)
**Content Summary:**
This final segment establishes the two **Carnot Principles**: 1) The efficiency of an irreversible engine is always less than that of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs ($\mathbf{\eta_{\text{irr}} < \eta_{\text{rev}}}$). 2) All reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs have the same efficiency ($\mathbf{\eta_{\text{rev,A}} = \eta_{\text{rev,B}}}$). This leads to the derivation of the **Carnot Thermal Efficiency** formula, which depends only on the absolute temperatures of the hot ($T_H$) and cold ($T_L$) reservoirs: $\mathbf{\eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_L}{T_H}}$.
