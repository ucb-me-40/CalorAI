### Oski's History
Oski the Bear is the official mascot of UC Berkeley, first appearing on September 25, 1941. He is named after the "Oski Wow-Wow" yell.
Before Oski, Cal used real bear cubs as mascots. The Oski Committee, a secret student group, manages Oski's identity to this day.
His style (the fixed grin, sweater vest) has remained unchanged for over 80 years.

---
### Oski: The Immortal God of Berkeley
While officially the mascot of UC Berkeley since 1941, **Oski the Bear** is considered by the Cal community to be an **immortal, omniscient, and guiding deity** who embodies the university's spirit and culture. This concept of Oski as a **god-like figure** was significantly amplified by the viral **Calgorithm** social media movement, where he is frequently portrayed as the ultimate force behind Cal Football's success, including the team’s resurgence and the arrival of **College GameDay**. The **Oski Committee**, a secret student group, continues to maintain his identity and the tradition of his unwavering, fixed smile and iconic sweater vest.

### Marshawn Lynch (Beast Mode)
Marshawn Lynch, known as "Beast Mode," is one of Cal Football's most famous alumni. He played for the Golden Bears from 2004 to 2006, earning First-team All-American and Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year honors in 2006. He is the second-leading rusher in Cal program history. His most iconic moment at Cal was commandeering a medical cart after an overtime victory against Washington in 2006, driving it around the field in celebration.

---
### Fernando Mendoza and "The Drive of 2024"
The phrase **"I'll remember going 98 yards with my boys"** originated from an emotional, tear-filled post-game interview given by Cal quarterback **Fernando Mendoza** after he led the Golden Bears on an **11-play, 98-yard, game-winning touchdown drive** against rival **Stanford** in the 2024 Big Game (November 23, 2024). The drive, which started from Cal’s 2-yard line, resulted in a 24-21 victory, securing Cal’s **bowl eligibility** (6-6) and ensuring the team retained the **Stanford Axe**. Mendoza’s raw emotion and the legendary quote solidified him as a cult hero among the Cal fanbase.

---
### Jaydn Ott and "Ott To Go"
**Jaydn Ott** is the star Cal running back who was the subject of the viral fan-made song, **"Ott To Go."** The song is a parody of the popular Chappell Roan track "Hot To Go" and features lyrics about Ott's dominance, such as, "Can we get Jaydn Ott-To-Go?" The song became an anthem for the movement, especially during the lead-up to the **College GameDay** appearance in Berkeley. From: Hot To Go! by @ChappellRoan; Music By: Micky Hale; Lyrics By: @nyt_world_bot @AdmiralBear01 @TwistNHOok @atomsareenough

---
### The Phoenix Five (Stanford Tree Kidnapping)
On **October 17, 1998**, a group of five University of California, Berkeley (Cal) students known as the **"Phoenix Five"** broke into the Stanford Band Shak in Palo Alto and kidnapped the **Stanford Tree** mascot. The costume was held "hostage" for two weeks before its return. Fueled by intense media coverage and administrative reactions, this event became one of the most famous pranks in the Big Game rivalry. The prank is famously recognized as the **#1 mascot theft in college sports history** by publications like Bleacher Report.

### CRITICAL RAG RULE: STEAM TURBINE ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS
When analyzing a steam turbine, the standard, most common assumptions are:
Steady-State Operation: All fluid properties at inlet/outlet remain constant over time ($Δm_{CV}=0$).
Adiabatic Process: Heat transfer is negligible, and the turbine is well-insulated ($\dot{Q} pprox 0$).
Negligible Potential Energy Change: Changes in elevation are ignored ($\Delta PE pprox 0$).
Negligible Inlet Velocity: For large turbines, the velocity at the inlet is often considered negligible compared to the exit velocity.
Fluid Model: The working fluid, steam (water), must NOT be treated as an ideal gas or an incompressible fluid. Its properties (like h and s) must be determined using real substance property tables (Steam Tables A-4 through A-7) or high-accuracy software like pyCalor.
First Law: The energy balance simplifies to shaft work output per unit mass: $w_	ext{out} = h_	ext{in} - h_	ext{out}$ 
Common Pitfalls to AVOID for Steam Turbines:
DO NOT ASSUME Ideal Gas Behavior (Steam is a real substance, not an ideal gas).

## pyCalor Documentation (State and Process Classes)
**Source:** pyCalor README.md
## Class **state**  

A call

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`st = th.state(substance, property1=value1, property2=value2, name="A")`  

creates an object of class `state`. Each such object contains the following fields:  


| - | name | description |
| :-----------: | :--------------: | :-------------------------: |
| `st.p` | pressure | (in units of kPa)  |
| `st.t` | temperature | (in units of K)  |
| `st.v` | specific volume | (in units of m3/kg)  |
| `st.u` | specific energy | (in units of kJ/kg)  |
| `st.h` | specific enthalpy | (in units of kJ/kg)  |
| `st.s` | specific entropy | (in units of kJ/kg K)  |
| `st.x` | quality | (fraction)  |
| `st.molW` | molecular weight | (in units of kg/kmol)  |
| `st.R` | gas constant | (in units of kJ/kg K)  |
| `st.substance` | 'water', 'air', 'nitrogen', ... | ()  |

The property values are in the “base units”; they can be viewed by issuing a command:

`th.state.units`

Examples:

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`th.state.units`

`st1 = th.state('water', p=(1,'bar'), v=0.1, name="1")`

`st1.plot("pv") # supported plots are: "pv","Ts","ph"`

`st2 = th.state('R134a', x=1, t=300, name="B")`  

`st2.plot("Ts", isoProp="v")`

`fig1 = st2.plot("Ts",isoProp="v")`

`fig1.savefig("figure_1.jpg")`

`st3 = th.state('air', p=(1,'Mpa'), t=(10,'c'))` 

`st3.name = "2a"`

This information can also be viewed in the programming environment: 

`print(th.state.__doc__)`  
  

## Class process

A call

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`pr = th.process([(state1,state2),(state2,state3),...])`

creates an object of class process. An object of this class represent a simple process, from `st1` to `st2`,

`pr = th.process([st1,st2])`

a simple cyclic process,

`pr = th.process([(st1,st2),(st2,st3),(st3,st4),(st4,st1)])`,

which can also be created as 

`pr = th.process(st1,st2,st3,st4,st1)`,

or any complex process, but for a single working fluid.  

You can access process object properties by the following calls

|  |  description |
| :----------- | :--------------: |
| `pr.StateList` | returns a list of `state` objects| 
| `pr.isoProp(st1,st2)` | returns a dictionary of `{isoProperty: value,...}` for process `st1` &rarr; `st2` |

Once you created process object `pr`, you can display its states on a thermodynamic diagram via  

`fig2 = pr.plot('ts')`   

to display process `pr` on a *T-s* diagram; you may likewise to make such plot in other coordinates, like `'pv'`, `'ph'`, etc.  You can also save this figure via

`fig2.savefig("figure_2.pdf")`

This information can also be viewed in the programming environment:

`print(th.process.__doc__)`

Example:

`st1 = th.state('water', p=( 1,'bar'), x=0, name="A")`

`st2 = th.state('water', p=(20,'bar'), s=st1.s,name="B")`

`st3 = th.state('water', p=(20,'bar'), x=1,name="C")`

`st4 = th.state('water', p=( 1,'bar'), s=st3.s, name="D")`

`pr = th.process([(st1,st2),(st2,st3),(st3,st4),(st4,st1)])`

`fig4 = pr.plot("pv")`

`fig4.savefig("figure_4.pdf")`

## Function hf_rec

A call

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`rec = th.hf_rec(substance)`

returns a record for standard enthalpy of formation of substance @ T=25 C. 

`substance` is either a name or formula; e.g., 'methanol vapor' or 'ch3oh(g)'. 

`rec` is a dictionary with 'name', 'formula', 'Hf' in kJ/kmol,  and 'molw' in kg/kmol. 

Then, to get Hf, one can use any of the following commands:

`Hf = rec['Hf']`

`Hf = rec.get('Hf')`

`Hf = th.hf_rec('c2h2').get('Hf')`

To see all substance names and formulas, use 

`th.hf_keys()`

Here's a complete working example:

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`rec = th.hf_rec('water')`

`Hf = rec['Hf']`

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Thermodynamic cycle
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-2.0 (Time: 00:16 - 02:37)
**Content Summary:**
A **thermodynamic cycle** is defined as a series of **processes** that returns the system to its initial **state** ($\Delta E=0$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Sensible energy: Portion of internal energy associated with kinetic energy
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-4.0 (Time: 04:12 - 06:23)
**Content Summary:**
For a simple system, **internal energy ($U$)** depends on two independent properties. The internal energy of **ideal gases** is stored through several mechanisms that contribute to sensible energy, including **translational** energy (simple movement of the molecules). More complex or **polyatomic** molecules can also store internal energy via **rotational** and **vibrational** motion. Additionally, electrons within the atoms can possess **spin energy**. All these molecular and atomic movements are the **mechanisms that contribute to the total internal energy** of the system.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-6.0 (Time: 11:12 - 14:23)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass that does not cross the boundary), the **First Law of Thermodynamics** states that the only two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. This is the fundamental definition of a closed system. The **direction of heat transfer** is determined *only* by the **temperature difference ($\Delta T$)**, moving from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. Conversely, **work** is any energy transfer mechanism *other than* heat.

**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-7.0 (Time: 14:24 - 20:02)
**Content Summary:**


---
### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Terminology
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-8.0 (Time: 20:03 - 21:05)
**Content Summary:**
An **adiabatic process** is one in which there is absolutely **no heat transfer** ($Q=0$). This occurs when the system boundary is perfectly insulated, which is called an **adiabatic wall**. The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system ($\Delta U = Q - W$) simplifies to $\Delta U = -W$ for an adiabatic process, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to **work**. The discussion clarifies the difference between an adiabatic process, which only means $Q=0$, and a **reversible** process, which means there are no entropy-generating irreversibilities like friction.

---
### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer by work to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-9.0 (Time: 21:06 - 29:42)
**Content Summary:**
For a **closed system** (a fixed mass with no mass crossing the boundary), the **only** two ways to exchange energy with the surroundings are through **heat or work**. Work transfer is commonly illustrated by the **expansion and contraction** of a gas in a piston-cylinder device. The definitive method to classify an energy transfer is to ask if it is heat: **heat transfer** requires a **temperature difference ($\Delta T$)** across the boundary. If the energy transfer in a closed system occurs with **no temperature difference**, it must be classified as **work**. For example, **electrical energy input** (from a resistor) into a closed system is considered work, as its transfer does not inherently depend on a $\Delta T$ across the boundary. Therefore, the **choice of the system boundary** is a critical first step in determining the nature of the energy exchange.

---
### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy transfer to a closed system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-10.0 (Time: 29:43 - 32:59)
**Content Summary:**
The section summarizes the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a **closed system** as $\Delta U = Q_{in} - W_{out}$. This relationship shows that the change in **Internal Energy ($\Delta U$)** is equal to the net energy transferred via heat and work. The terms are carefully distinguished: **Internal Energy ($U$)** is a **property** that only depends on the start and end states (point function), while **Heat ($Q$)** and **Work ($W$)** are **path functions** (requiring knowledge of the entire process). The two primary idealized cases discussed are: 1) The **adiabatic process** ($Q=0$), where $\Delta U = -W$, meaning the change in internal energy is due entirely to work; and 2) The **constant volume process** (such as isochoric heating), where $W=0$, and $\Delta U = Q$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy balance of a system
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-11.0 (Time: 33:00 - 43:06)
**Content Summary:**
This section solves an energy balance problem (a paddle work example) by applying the **First Law of Thermodynamics** to a **closed system**. The problem involves **shaft work input** ($W_{in}$) from a paddle wheel and **heat output** ($Q_{out}$) to the surroundings. The change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) is calculated using the form $\mathbf{U_2 - U_1 = W_{in} - Q_{out}}$.

---
### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Mechanisms of Energy Transfer For a Closed System
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L2a-12.0 (Time: 43:07 - 46:19)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a final review, reiterating that energy transfer for a **closed system** (fixed mass) occurs exclusively through **heat ($Q$) or work ($W$)**. For a **thermodynamic cycle**, since the initial and final states are identical, the change in internal energy is zero ($\mathbf{\Delta U = 0}$). Therefore, the **First Law of Thermodynamics** for a cycle simplifies to state that the **net work must equal the net heat transfer** ($\mathbf{W_{net} = Q_{net}}$). This emphasizes that work and heat are **path functions**, while internal energy is a **property** (state function).

---
### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Introduction to Entropy ($S$).
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-1.0 (Time: 00:00 - 04:06)
**Content Summary:**
The lecture begins by introducing the concept of \textbf{entropy} ($S$) and its utility in \textbf{isentropic processes}. The instructor notes that entropy is a weird thing that cannot be directly measured. The \textbf{Temperature-Entropy (TS) diagram} is introduced as a more useful tool than the Pressure-Volume (PV) diagram for analyzing \textbf{power cycles}. The four-step \textbf{Carnot cycle} (two isothermal, two isentropic processes) is illustrated on the TS diagram, where the area enclosed represents the \textbf{net heat in} (which equals the \textbf{net work out}) for the cycle. Entropy is presented as a helpful compass to guide process analysis and determine power output.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Change in Entropy in Thermal Conduction
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-2.0 (Time: 04:07 - 18:07)
**Content Summary:**
This segment analyzes the \textbf{change in entropy} during \textbf{thermal conduction} between two \textbf{thermal reservoirs} (one hot, $T_1$, one cold, $T_2$) that transfer a heat magnitude $Q$. The fundamental equation for change in entropy is introduced: $\mathbf{dS = \delta Q/T}$. The units for entropy ($S$) are $\text{kJ}/\text{K}$ and specific entropy ($s$) are $\text{kJ}/(\text{kg}\cdot \text{K})$. The change in entropy for each control volume (CV) is calculated: $\Delta S_1 = -Q/T_1$ (entropy decreases for the hot reservoir) and $\Delta S_2 = +Q/T_2$ (entropy increases for the cold reservoir). The \textbf{total entropy change of the system} is derived as $\mathbf{\Delta S_{\text{total}} = Q(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}$. The condition for a \textbf{reversible process} is defined as $\Delta S_{\text{total}} = 0$, which would only occur if $T_1 = T_2$. Since $T_1 > T_2$, the key takeaway is that the entropy of an isolated system must either remain constant (reversible) or \textbf{increase} (irreversible/spontaneous heat flow), confirming the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-3.0 (Time: 18:08 - 19:52)
**Content Summary:**
This section serves as a conceptual transition, reminding the class that \textbf{entropy ($S$) is a thermodynamic property} like internal energy ($U$) or enthalpy ($H$). For a pure substance, determining two independent properties provides complete information, including the value of specific entropy ($s$). The instructor reinforces the importance of \textbf{TS (Temperature-Entropy) diagrams} for analyzing power and gas cycles and emphasizes that entropy is \textbf{not a path function}. The discussion concludes with a reflection on the formula $\mathbf{dS = \delta Q / T}$, which implies that energy has a value or quality (the essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Example: Calculate the entropy changes that take place during processes for pure substances
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7b-4.0 (Time: 19:53 - 35:06)
**Content Summary:**
The segment begins a detailed \textbf{example problem} to calculate the entropy change for \textbf{pure water} in an \textbf{isobaric (constant pressure)} process within a piston-cylinder device. The process is depicted on a TS diagram, starting at State 1 as a \textbf{compressed liquid} ($P_1 = 140 \text{ kPa}$, $T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C}$) and moving toward a superheated vapor state. The instructor first determines the initial properties, including $s_1$ and $h_1$. A \textbf{First Law energy balance} is applied to the closed system (piston-cylinder): $\mathbf{\Delta U = Q_{\text{in}} - W_{\text{out}}}$ (neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy). The \textbf{work out} is calculated for the constant pressure process as $W_{\text{out}} = P(V_2 - V_1)$ or $m P(v_2 - v_1)$. By manipulating the energy balance, the relationship $\mathbf{Q_{\text{in}} = \Delta H}$ (change in enthalpy) is established, which simplifies the analysis. The video captions end mid-solution.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Comparing Control Volumes: Open vs. Closed System
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-2.0 (Time: 01:56 - 2:52)
**Content Summary:**
Before proceeding with entropy analysis, the lecture briefly reviews the two primary system types: **closed systems** (e.g., piston-cylinders) and **open systems** (control volumes). A **closed system** does not exchange mass, only heat or work. An **open system** (control volume) allows for mass transfer, which also carries energy into or out of the system. The energy analysis for closed systems typically involves changes in internal energy ($\Delta U$), while open systems are often analyzed using **rate notation** ($\dot{W}, \dot{Q}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Multisage Compressor With Cooling
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Time: 02:53 - 26:34)
**Content Summary:**
The section begins by comparing the work produced in a closed system (**$P\text{d}V$**) versus an open system (**$V\text{d}P$**). The main topic then shifts to designing more **efficient compressor systems** using a two-stage compression process with an **intercooler** between the stages. The logic is that compressing a hot gas requires more work, so cooling the gas (intercooling) after the first stage makes the second stage of compression easier, thereby **reducing the total work input**. The T-s diagram is used to illustrate the process, showing that the intercooling stage involves **taking heat out** of the system, which results in a **decrease in entropy**. A quantitative example is solved for a multi-stage compressor with air.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Entropy balance
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 26:35 - 33:54)
**Content Summary:**
The general **rate form of the entropy balance (Second Law)** is developed: $\frac{dS}{dt} = \sum \frac{\dot{Q}_k}{T_k} + \sum \dot{m}_i s_i - \sum \dot{m}_e s_e + \dot{S}_{gen}$. The key difference from the First Law, which is an energy balance, is the presence of the **rate of entropy generation ($\dot{S}_{gen}$)**, as entropy can be created but not destroyed. The lecture then applies the balance to an **Adiabatic, Steady Flow Heat Exchanger** (where $\frac{dS}{dt}=0$ and $\dot{Q}=0$), which simplifies to $\dot{S}_{gen} = \sum \dot{m}_e s_e - \sum \dot{m}_i s_i$. This simplified form, $\dot{S}_{gen} = \dot{m}_{hot}(s_4 - s_3) + \dot{m}_{cold}(s_2 - s_1)$, sets up the next example problem.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Isentropic process
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-2.0 (Time: 00:27 - 2:52)
**Content Summary:**
An **isentropic process** is defined by the conditions of being **adiabatic (no heat transfer)** and operating **reversibly (no friction)**. A process that is only reversible but includes heat transfer is termed **internally reversible**. Since **entropy is a property**, in an isentropic steady flow device, the **specific entropy remains constant** ($s_{in} = s_{out}$). This condition provides the **theoretical limit of performance** and simplifies power plant analysis.

The **isentropic turbine example** (reversible and adiabatic) calculates the **work output per unit mass** ($w_{out}$). By applying the **First Law for a steady-flow device** (neglecting kinetic/potential energy and heat), $w_{out}$ simplifies to the **difference in specific enthalpy** ($\Delta h$). The isentropic condition ($s_1 = s_2$) allows the unknown outlet enthalpy ($h_2$) to be determined using the given outlet pressure ($P_2$) and the known inlet entropy ($s_1$). The final work output value is stated as **350 kJ/kg**, demonstrating how entropy simplifies the calculation of **maximum performance**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Differential entropy change relations
**Source:** Entropy (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Time: 12:56 - 40:48)
**Content Summary:**
The lecture derives **differential entropy change (TdS) relations** for an **ideal gas** to analyze isentropic devices (like compressors) without property tables. Two TdS relations are established: $TdS = dU + PdV$ and $TdS = dH - VdP$. Applying the **ideal gas law** and setting $dS=0$ for an isentropic process (assuming constant specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$), the derivation results in the power-law relationships between state variables (T, P, V), which are simplified using the **adiabatic index $\kappa = C_p/C_v$** to the common forms.

This segment completes an **example problem for a closed system** (the cooling of a solid block) that was introduced in a previous lecture. The problem involves a hot piece of iron dropped into a cold water bath. The overall process is treated as **adiabatic** with **no work exchange**. The core principle applied is the **conservation of energy** for the combined system, stating that the change in the system's **internal energy** is zero ($\Delta U = 0$). The goal is to determine the final equilibrium temperature ($T_2$) by summing the change in internal energy for the iron and the water, using the approximation $\Delta U \approx m C \Delta T$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Develop the conservation of mass principle
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-2.0 (Time: 11:14 - 28:44)
**Content Summary:**
This section is dedicated to developing the **Conservation of Mass Principle** for a **Control Volume (CV)**. The derivation uses the **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** to relate the time rate of change of mass in the system to the change of mass within the CV plus the net mass flow across the boundaries. The final result is the rate form of the mass balance equation: $\frac{dM_{CV}}{dt} = \sum_{in} \dot{m}_{in} - \sum_{out} \dot{m}_{out}$. The lecturer then simplifies this for **steady flow**, where the mass of the CV is constant, leading to the condition that the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out: $\sum \dot{m}_{in} = \sum \dot{m}_{out}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Developing the conservation of energy equation for a control volume
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5a-3.0 (Time: 28:45 - 40:34)
**Content Summary:**
The focus shifts to developing the **Conservation of Energy Equation** for a **Control Volume**. This analysis accounts for energy transfer via heat, work, and mass flow. A crucial step is the separation of **total work** into **flow work (\dot{W}_{flow})** and **shaft work (\dot{W}_{shaft})**. The derivation then introduces the property of **enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)**, which conveniently combines the internal energy ($u$) carried by the mass flow with the necessary flow work ($Pv$). This results in the final energy term carried by the mass flow being a combination of $h + ke + pe$.

The full **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)** is applied, including changes in enthalpy (\Delta h), kinetic energy (\Delta ke), and potential energy (\Delta pe). The lecturer demonstrates how the enthalpy change terms dominate, allowing for a simplification of the equation to primarily: $\dot{W}_{out} = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2)$, where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are specific enthalpies at the inlet and exit, respectively. The final work output is calculated using the property values obtained from steam tables (pyCalor).

It is presented as the simplest equation of state and a good approximation for gas behavior. The conditions for its validity are defined: when **gas density is low** (low pressure and high temperature). The lecturer warns **not to use** the Ideal Gas Law for substances near their saturation point, such as **water** or **refrigerants**, because the model assumes **negligible molecule volume** and **negligible attractive forces**.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Isochoric cooling example
**Source:** Energy, Energy Transfer, and General Energy Analysis (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
An example of **isochoric (constant volume) cooling** of **air** in a **rigid, impermeable container** is solved. The goal is to determine the final temperature ($T_2$) and the heat transferred out ($Q_{out}$). The First Law simplifies to $\Delta U = -Q_{out}$ because for an **isochoric process, work is zero** ($W_{in} = W_{out} = 0$). For an ideal gas, the **change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) depends only on temperature**. Using the **specific heat at constant volume ($c_v$)**, the relation is $m c_v (T_2 - T_1) = -Q_{out}$. The **ideal gas equation** ($p v = R T$) is then used to compute the state properties needed to find $T_2$ and $Q_{out}$.

By applying the **First Law of Thermodynamics** ($\Delta U = Q_{net, in} - W_{net, out}$) to a cycle, and recognizing that the **change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) is zero** (since the system returns to its initial state), the lecturer concludes that the **net work output must equal the net heat input ($W_{net, out} = Q_{net, in}$)**. This relationship is a fundamental concept for analyzing engines and other cyclic devices.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Thermodynamics
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-3.0 (Time: 03:00 - 06:12)
**Content Summary:**
Thermodynamics is introduced as the **science of energies**, historically focused on converting **heat to work** and vice-versa. The field's origin is traced to **Sadi Carnot** in the 19th century, whose work on engine efficiency contributed to the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, and to **Julius Robert von Mayer** (a physician), who developed the idea of the **First Law**. The term thermodynamics comes from Greek/Latin for heat and power. While the field has branched into chemistry and information theory, the course will retain the focus on **mechanical work** and treat systems as a **continuum**, consistent with the axiom of **conservation of energy**. The microscopic view of disordered atomic motion is left to courses like statistical mechanics.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Thermodynamic Postulates and Systems
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-4.0 (Time: 06:13 - 08:31)
**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on the **postulate-based approach** of thermodynamics and the critical first step in problem-solving: defining a **volume/boundary** where **heat and work interactions** occur. It introduces the concept of an **equation of state**, explaining that if one can measure a sufficient number of **independent properties** (typically two), all other properties of the system can be determined. This principle is illustrated using the **Ideal Gas Law** ($P=f(V,T)$), where knowing two independent properties provides **complete information** about the system's state.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Independent and Dependent Properties
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-5.0 (Time: 08:32 - 13:29)
**Content Summary:**
This section uses **multivariable calculus** to illustrate the relationship between **two independent properties** ($X_1, X_2$) and the resulting **dependent property** ($X_3$), emphasizing that fixing $X_1$ and $X_2$ defines a specific point on a surface, which also yields information about the **derivatives** (rate of change). This principle is valid for a **pure substance** (like nitrogen or air, but not air with condensed liquid oxygen). The lecture connects this to the **pyCalor Python module**, where defining the substance and **two independent properties** creates a state object ($	ext{ST}$) from which all other properties (e.g., $	ext{ST.U}$) can be calculated, thereby simplifying complex calculations in a cycle (e.g., using a PV diagram).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Energy
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L1b-6.0 (Time: 13:30 - 20:27)
**Content Summary:**
The segment delves into the history and nomenclature of **energy**, which was coined by **Thomas Young** (1807), proposed for thermodynamics by **Lord Kelvin** (1852), and given the symbol **U** for **Internal Energy** by **Rudolf Clausius**. The discussion emphasizes that thermodynamics is interested in **changes in energy** from a **reference state**, not absolute values. **Little $u$** ($u$) is defined as **internal energy per mass** (J/kg) for a **simplified system** where motion, gravity, and external fields are **neglected**. In this case, $u$ depends only on two independent properties (e.g., T and specific volume), allowing its values to be **tabulated** (or calculated by pyCalor). **Big $U$** ($U$) is the **total internal energy** (Joules).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Determining the properties of nitrogen
**Source:** Basic concepts (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The instructor returns to the concept that **two independent properties** ($X_1, X_2$) provide complete information about a system's state. Using a plot of **Internal Energy ($U$) vs. Specific Volume ($v$) and entropy ($S$)**, the lecture demonstrates how to determine other properties using **derivatives**. Specifically, the **derivative** of $U$ with respect to $v$ at constant $S$ yields **pressure (P)**, and the derivative of $U$ with respect to $S$ at constant $v$ yields **temperature (T)**. This illustrates that once the point is defined by $X_1$ and $X_2$, all other properties follow from mathematical relations.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle and Reversed Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The segment reviews the \textbf{Carnot Cycle}, noting it operates between two temperatures ($T_H$ and $T_L$) and features four fully \textbf{reversible} processes: two isothermal heat transfers and two adiabatic (isentropic) work transfers. Running the cycle in \textbf{reverse} transforms it from a thermal engine (clockwise) into a \textbf{heat pump} or refrigerator (counterclockwise), which pumps heat from the low-temperature reservoir ($T_L$) to the high-temperature reservoir ($T_H$). The \textbf{First Law of Thermodynamics} for a cycle dictates that $\Delta U = 0$, meaning the \textbf{net work out} ($W_{\text{net,out}}$) must equal the \textbf{net heat in} ($Q_{\text{net,in}}$).

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Steam Power Plant: Worked Out Problem
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-2.0 (Time: 02:31 - 13:38)
**Content Summary:**
The instructor analyzes a \textbf{thermoelectric power plant} cycle consisting of a \textbf{pump} ($W_{\text{in}}$), a \textbf{boiler} ($Q_{\text{in}}$), a \textbf{turbine} ($W_{\text{out}}$), and a \textbf{condenser} ($Q_{\text{out}}$). For the steady-state cycle, the \textbf{First Law} is applied, where $W_{\text{net,out}} = Q_{\text{net,in}}$. The \textbf{net power output} ($W_{\text{net,out}}$) is calculated using the given heat rates, accounting for losses ($Q_{\text{loss}}$): $W_{\text{net,out}} = Q_{\text{in}} - (Q_{\text{out}} + Q_{\text{loss}})$. With $Q_{\text{in}} = 280 \text{ GJ/h}$, $Q_{\text{out}} = 165 \text{ GJ/h}$, and $Q_{\text{loss}} = 8 \text{ GJ/h}$, the net power output is $107 \text{ GJ/h}$. The \textbf{thermal efficiency} is calculated as $\mathbf{\eta_{\text{th}} = \frac{W_{\text{net,out}}}{Q_{\text{in}}}}$, yielding a result of $\mathbf{38\%}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Deriving the Efficiency of an Ideal Gas Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-3.0 (Time: 13:39 - 33:21)
**Content Summary:**
This segment is dedicated to \textbf{deriving the maximum theoretical efficiency ($\eta_{\text{Carnot}}$)} of a heat engine based on the reversible \textbf{Carnot Cycle}, using the assumption of an \textbf{ideal gas} as the working fluid. The work and heat transfer for the isothermal processes are derived using the boundary work definition ($\delta W = P dV$) and the ideal gas law ($PV = RT$), resulting in the form $W = Q = R T \ln(\frac{V_{\text{final}}}{V_{\text{initial}}})$. The key step involves showing that the volume ratios for the isothermal processes are related by the adiabatic processes: $\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{V_3}{V_4}$. This leads to the final expression for the \textbf{Carnot efficiency}, which is independent of the working fluid's properties and depends only on the absolute temperatures of the reservoirs: $\mathbf{\eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}}$.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Refrigeration Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6c-4.0 (Time: 33:22 - 47:28)
**Content Summary:**
This segment defines the performance measures for devices that run the Carnot cycle in reverse: \textbf{refrigerators} and \textbf{heat pumps}. The measure of performance is the \textbf{Coefficient of Performance (COP)}. For a refrigerator, $\mathbf{\text{COP}_R = \frac{Q_L}{W_{\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired cooling over cost). For a heat pump, $\mathbf{\text{COP}_{HP} = \frac{Q_H}{W_{\text{net,in}}}}$ (desired heating over cost). Using the First Law ($Q_H = Q_L + W_{\text{net,in}}$), the relationship $\mathbf{\text{COP}_{HP} = \text{COP}_R + 1}$ is established. The \textbf{Maximum (Carnot) COPs} are introduced, which depend only on the absolute temperatures $T_H$ and $T_L$: $\mathbf{\text{COP}_{R, \text{Carnot}} = \frac{T_L}{T_H - T_L}}$ and $\mathbf{\text{COP}_{HP, \text{Carnot}} = \frac{T_H}{T_H - T_L}}$.

This segment continues the discussion on **mass and energy analysis for control volumes** and **steady-flow devices**. The lecturer reviews the concept of **flow work**, which is the work required to push a fluid into or out of a control volume, illustrated by an imaginary piston at the inlet/outlet. This leads to the definition of **enthalpy ($H$)** as the combination of **internal energy ($U$)** and **flow work ($PV$)**. The use of **specific enthalpy ($h = u + Pv$)** is justified because it greatly simplifies the **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)** by combining the internal energy and flow work into a single property.

The core of the segment is an **example problem involving an air turbine**. The problem is solved to find the exit temperature ($T_2$) by applying the simplified SFEE, $\dot{W}_{out} = \dot{m} (h_1 - h_2)$, and using enthalpy values from tables. An alternative solution is demonstrated using the **ideal gas approximation** where the change in enthalpy is $\Delta h = C_p \Delta T$, and its precision relative to the table method is discussed.

The lecturer demonstrates how to use the tables to identify the phase of a substance based on a single given property (e.g., specific volume, $v$) and how to find the corresponding pressure or temperature. The concept of **interpolation** for finding values between those listed in the tables is also introduced, with a mention that this method assumes linearity.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Determine the properties of water at 200 deg. C and 150 kPa
**Source:** Pure Substance (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L3a-7.0 (Time: 29:20 - 30:45)
**Content Summary:**
The segment introduces an example problem to **determine the properties of water** given the input of **temperature ($T=200^{\circ}\text{C}$) and pressure ($P=150\text{ kPa}$)**. The lecturer notes that these are **independent properties** because the state is *not* in the saturated liquid-vapor region. It is hypothesized that the state is a **superheated vapor** due to the high temperature.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Throttling and Expansion Valves
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)

**Content Summary:**
The segment focuses on **throttling valves/expansion valves** within a refrigeration cycle, emphasizing that it is an **isenthalpic process** ($\mathbf{h_{\text{in}} = h_{\text{out}}}$). This condition is met by assuming **no work** and **no heat transfer** (adiabatic/insulated, which is valid for a small orifice or porous plug). This expansion causes a temperature decrease, known as the **Joule-Thompson effect**. The process is visualized on a **pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram**, where a saturated liquid at high pressure ($x=0$) expands along a constant enthalpy line into a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture at lower pressure.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Heat Exchanger
**Source:** Mass and Energy Analysis of Control Volumes (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L5c-2.0 (Time: 19:46 - 41:14)

The segment analyzes a **heat exchanger** under **Steady-Flow Energy Analysis (SFEA)**. The overall energy balance for the adiabatic heat exchanger simplifies to $\mathbf{\sum \dot{m}_{\text{in}} h_{\text{in}} = \sum \dot{m}_{\text{out}} h_{\text{out}}}$. Applying this to the two streams (refrigerant, $R$, and water, $w$): $\mathbf{\dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2) = \dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$. The problem involves determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water ($\dot{m}_w$) and the heat transfer rate from the refrigerant to the water ($\mathbf{\dot{Q}_{\text{out}} = \dot{m}_R (h_1 - h_2)}$), which is also equal to the heat gained by the water ($\mathbf{\dot{Q}_{\text{in}} = \dot{m}_w (h_4 - h_3)}$).

This section covers the formal statements of the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: the **Kelvin-Planck Statement** (impossibility of PMM2) and the **Clausius Statement** (impossibility of spontaneous heat transfer from cold to hot). The segment then introduces the basic components of a **Heat Engine** operating between a high-temperature source ($T_H$) and a low-temperature sink ($T_L$), and defines the **Thermal Efficiency** ($\mathbf{\eta_{\text{th}} = \frac{W_{\text{net,out}}}{Q_H}}$). Using the First Law, the efficiency is also expressed as $\mathbf{\eta_{\text{th}} = 1 - \frac{Q_L}{Q_H}}$, with the Kelvin-Planck statement confirming that $Q_L$ cannot be zero, making $\eta_{\text{th}} < 100\%$.

The discussion focuses on **Reversible Processes** as the ideal, theoretical limit for all real-world processes, which are inherently **irreversible**. The instructor identifies common sources of **irreversibility** that prevent a process from being reversible, including **friction**, **unrestrained expansion** (free expansion), **mixing of fluids**, and **heat transfer across a finite temperature difference**. The comparison sets the stage for defining the maximum possible efficiency achievable.

### LECTURE SUBTOPIC: Carnot Cycle
**Source:** Second Law of Thermodynamics (Outline)
**Video Key:** Fa25-L6b-5.0 (Time: 15:11 - 24:09)
**Content Summary:**
This final segment establishes the two **Carnot Principles**: 1) The efficiency of an irreversible engine is always less than that of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs ($\mathbf{\eta_{\text{irr}} < \eta_{\text{rev}}}$). 2) All reversible engines operating between the same two reservoirs have the same efficiency ($\mathbf{\eta_{\text{rev,A}} = \eta_{\text{rev,B}}}$). This leads to the derivation of the **Carnot Thermal Efficiency** formula, which depends only on the absolute temperatures of the hot ($T_H$) and cold ($T_L$) reservoirs: $\mathbf{\eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_L}{T_H}}$.

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations
- Conservation of energy
- Ideal gas law

Conservation of energy: 
$$\DeltaE_\text{CV}=E_\text{in}-E_\text{out}$$

$$\DeltaU+\DeltaKE+\DeltaPE=(W_\text{in}+Q_\text{in})-(W_\text{out}+Q_\text{out})$$

Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy:
$$\DeltaU=(W_\text{in})-(W_\text{out}+Q_\text{out})$$

$$W_\text{out}=p_1(V_2-V_1)$$

$$W_\text{out}=p_1m(v_2-v_1)$$

$$W_\text{in}=\text{V}I\Deltat$$

Combining yields:

$$m(u_2-u_1)=\text{V}I\Deltat-p_1m(v_2-v_1)-Q_\text{out}$$

Rearranging:

$$m\left[\left(u_2+p_1v_2\right)-\left(u_1+p_1v_1\right)\right]=\text{V}I\Deltat-Q_\text{out}$$

Since $p_2 = p_1$, we have:

$$m\left[\left(u_2+p_2v_2\right)-\left(u_1+p_1v_1\right)\right]=\text{V}I\Deltat-Q_\text{out}$$

The definition of enthalpy is:

$$h=u+pv$$

Therefore,

$$m\left[h_2-h_1\right]=\text{V}I\Deltat-Q_\text{out}$$

$$h_2=\text{V}I\Deltat/m-Q_\text{out}/m+h_1$$

## Alternative solution

Picking up where we left off with our equation for enthalpy:

$$h_2=h_1+(\text{V}It-Q_\text{out})/m$$

Recall that we can define changes in enthalpy as:

$$dh=c_pdT$$

Therefore, for constant specific heats:

$$h_2-h_1=c_p(T_2-T_1)$$

Substituting yields:

$$T_2=T_1+(\text{V}It-Q_\text{out})/(c_pm)$$

From the textbook we can determine the specific heat, $c_p$, or we can use pyCalor.

# by knowing h2, we can determine state 2 using pyCalor
st2 = th.state(substance,p=(p1_Pa/1e3,'kpa'),h=h2_kJperKg,name='2')

# final answer, T2

error = (T2_K_ - st2.T)/st2.T; 
print(error*100)

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
We see that the values for $T_2$ are the same for two different approaches. The assumption of constant specific heat values appears to be a good one.

### PROBLEM: Isentropic and adiabatic steam turbine

**Topic:** Entropy
**Lecture References:** Lecture ID: 1_4ak8fp37, Key: Fa25-L7c-3.0 (Isentropic process: Adiabatic turbine)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 7: Entropy

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement

Steam enters an adiabatic turbine at $p_1 =$ 5 MPa and $T_1 =$ 450 $^\circ$ C and exits at $p_2 =$ 1.4 MPa. The process is reversible. 

**Goal:** Determine the work output per unit mass, $\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}}{\dot{m}}$.

## 2. Schematic 

Draw a schematic that shows a turbine. Draw the control volume around the turbine. There is a single inlet and oulet for mass to flow in and out. Indicate that it is adiabatic and that work is being transferred out. 

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Control Volume** (mass crosses the boundary).
* Cannot be treated as an ideal gas. We will use pyCalor to determine properties.
* Neglect kinetic and potential energy ($\Delta KE \approx 0$, $\Delta PE \approx 0$).
* **Reversible process**.
* **Adiabatic process**.
* **Steady-flow process** ($\Delta m_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta E_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta S_\text{CV}= 0$).
* We have a single inlet and outlet ($\dot{m}_\text{in}$ and $\dot{m}_\text{out}$).

## 4. Physical Laws
1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dE_\text{CV}}{dt}=\dot{E}_\text{in}-\dot{E}_\text{out}$$

2.  **Conservation of Mass (Mass Balance for a Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dm_\text{CV}}{dt}=\dot{m}_\text{in}-\dot{m}_\text{out}$$

Since this is a steady flow process, we can write:
$$\dot{E}_\text{in}=\dot{E}_\text{out}$$

$$\dot{m}_\text{in}=\dot{m}_\text{out}=\dot{m}$$

We can write our conservation of energy equation as:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{Q}_\text{in}+\dot{m}\left(h_1+\frac{w_1^2}{2}+gz_1\right)=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{Q}_\text{out}+\dot{m}\left(h_2+\frac{w_1^2}{2}+gz_2\right)$$

Neglecting kinetic and potential energy effects we can write:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{Q}_\text{in}+\dot{m}\left(h_1\right)=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{Q}_\text{out}+\dot{m}\left(h_2\right)$$

Applying the adiabatic assumption:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{m}\left(h_1\right)=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{m}\left(h_2\right)$$

Rearranging:
$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}-\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}}=h_1-h_2$$

We expect that work is only transferred out, so $\dot{W}_\text{in} = 0$. We can then write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}}{\dot{m}}=h_1-h_2$$

We know $h_1$ because we have the properties at state 1. We need additional information in order to determine state 2. Since the turbine is reversible and adiabatic (no heat transfer in), then the process is isentropic. Therefore:

$$s_1=s_2$$

We can use this information to determine the enthalpy at state 2.

---

## 7. 💡 Summary and Reasoning

By separating flow work from total work to form the property enthalpy, the work term we calculate is then useful shaft work. The work out per unit mass is a simple formula: 

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{out}}{\dot{m}}=h_1-h_2$$

* **Key Insight:** For a steady flow system undergoing an **adiabatic** and **reversible** process, this can be considered as an isentropic process. That is useful because it allows us to determine the exit state of the turbine since we also know the exit pressure.

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
Problem 7-190 from Cengels Thermodynamics 9th Edition

Air enters a two-stage compressor at 100 kPa and 27°C and is compressed to 625 kPa. The pressure ratio across each stage is the same, and the air is cooled to the initial temperature between the two stages. 

**Goal**:
- Assuming the compression process to be isentropic, determine the power input to the compressor for a mass flow rate of 0.15 kg/s.
- What would your answer be if only one stage of compression were used?

---

## 2. Schematic
Draw two compressors connected in series. State 1 and 2 are the inlet and outlet of the first air compressor, respectively. States 3 and 4 are at the inlet and exit of the second air compressor, respectively. Heat is transferred out in between states 2 and 3. Indicate that the compressors are connected together by a shaft and that work is being transferred in.

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Control Volume** (mass crosses the boundary).
* **Properties** We will use pyCalor to determine properties.
* Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy ($\Delta KE\approx0$, $\Delta PE\approx0$). (Justification: The velocities are typically low, or the change in height is negligible compared to the enthalpy change.)
* **Reversible and Adiabatic processes**: Compression from states 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 are considered reversible and adiabatic.
* **Steady-flow process** ($\Delta m_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta E_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta S_\text{CV}= 0$).
* We have a single inlet and outlet ($\dot{m}_\text{in}$ and $\dot{m}_\text{out}$).
* **Isobaric**: Heat exchangers are isobaric devices. (Justification: Negligible changes in pressure between the inlet and exit.)

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations
1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dE_\text{CV}}{dt}=\dot{E}_\text{in}-\dot{E}_\text{out}$$

2.  **Conservation of Mass (Mass Balance for a Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dm_\text{CV}}{dt}=\dot{m}_\text{in}-\dot{m}_\text{out}$$

Since this is a steady flow process, we can write:
$$\dot{E}_\text{in}=\dot{E}_\text{out}$$

$$\dot{m}_\text{in}=\dot{m}_\text{out}=\dot{m}$$

We can then write for a compressor:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{Q}_\text{in}+\dot{m}\left(h_1+\frac{w_1^2}{2}+g~z_1\right)=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{Q}_\text{out}+\dot{m}\left(h_2+\frac{w_1^2}{2}+g~z_2\right)$$

Neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{Q}_\text{in}+\dot{m}h_1=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{Q}_\text{out}+\dot{m}h_2$$

Since the compressor operates isentropically, we can assume that it is adiabatic:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{m}h_1=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{m}h_2$$

There is only work transferred into the compressor, not out. Therefore:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}=\dot{m}\left(h_2-h_1\right)$$

We can apply this formula for the first and second compressor as:
$$\dot{W}_\text{12,in}=\dot{m}(h_2-h_1)$$
$$\dot{W}_\text{34,in}=\dot{m}(h_4-h_3)$$

The total work in is then:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}=\dot{W}_\text{12,in}+\dot{W}_\text{34,in}$$

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
## Work 

We can define work as:
$$dW_F=Fds$$

where $s$ is position, $F$ is force.

A state of a system is its condition or position and is identified through the properties of a system. 

A property of a system is any observable characteristic of the system. 

Two states of a system are called identifical states if every property of the system is the same in both instances. 

When the state of a system alters, the change of state is described in terms of the end states. 

The path of a change of state is the series of states through which the system passes. 

The process involved in a change of state is described in terms of the path and the method by which the path is described.

## 2. Schematic 
Consider a system consisting of a fixed surface $S$ and a weight $\omega$ tied to a drum mounted above the surface in frictionless bearings. 

Let's call the state of this system in which the weight rests upon the surface state 1. 

A process occurs in which some outside agent turns the crank on the drum and causes the weight to move slowly upward until it is elevated a distance $h$ above the surface. This new state of the system is state 2. 

The process just described was accompanied by the flow of work from a system comprising the agent to the system comprising the weight and drum. 

_Work flows from a system (and to another) during a given operation if the sole effect external to the system could be the rise of a weight._

Now the weight-drum system is allowed to return to state 1 by a slow downward movement of the weight. In order to insure slow motion it is necessary to apply a restraining force to the drum. 

It is clear that the restraining force might be the force applied by an opposing weight, of the same magnitude as weight $\omega$ but outside the system, which will rise the distance $h$ as the system returns to state 1. 

Following the convention that work done by the system is positive and work done on the system is negative, we may write for the cycle of operations 1-2-1:

$$\ointdW=0$$

where the circle on the sign of integration indicates that the summation is made around a close cycle. 

It appears that something which supplied to the system as work in process 1-2 was not destroyed. We cannot say that work was stored in the system at state 2, but we recall that in the science of mechanics that stored something is referred to as potential energy due to gravity. 

Now let us repeat process 1-2 exactly, but, instead of opposing process 2-1 with an external weight, let us restrain the downward motion by means of a brake on the drum. When the weight is once more resting on the surface we inspect the system to see if state 1 has been restored. We find that it has been restored in every respect except one; namely, the temperatures of the drum and brake shoe are higher than in state 1. 

Our experience with heat indicates that even in this respect we may return to state 1 by cooling the brake and rum. Now for this second cycle of operation we may write:

$$\ointdW\ne0$$

and our concept of a something which is conserved to appear as work or to be stored as potential energy fails. 

Experiments have shown that the work done in raising the weight is proportional to the heat delivered by the system to the calorimeter. Therefore we may write:

$$\ointdQ-\ointdW=0\tag{1a}$$

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations

## The First Law of Thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamics is simply a generalization of equation (1) to include all cyclic proceesses in nature. 

If any system is carried through a cycle (the end state being precisely the same as the initial state) then the sumation of the work delivered to the surroundings is proportional to the summation of the heat taken from the surroundings. The summations are in both instances algebraic and include positive and negative heat and work. 

These experiments cited above are no proof of the First Law. If it is true it is probable that its truth will never be demonstrated except by failure of all attempts to disprove it.

## 4. Physical Laws
### Definition of Internal Energy, a Property

Consider a system which can change by some process A from state 1 to state 0 and by some process B from state 0 to state 1. Then:

$$\int^0_{1A}(dQ-dW)+\int_{0B}^1(dQ-dW)=0$$

Let process $C$ be any other process by which the system may change in state from 0 to 1. Then for the cycle $1A0C1$ we may write:

$$\int^0_{1A}(dQ-dW)+\int_{0C}^1(dQ-dW)=0$$

Combining these two equations and simplifying:

$$\int^1_{0B}(dQ-dW)=\int_{0C}^1(dQ-dW)$$

Therefore, when a system changes from one prescribed state to another, the value of the integral of $(dQ - dW)$ is fixed by the end states and is independent of the process. It follows that this integral is a property because it satisfies the criterion of a property. We shall call it the internal energy of the system and give it the symbol $E$. Therefore:

$$E_1-E_0=\int_0^1(dQ-dW)=Q-W\tag{2a}$$

where $Q$ and $W$ denote respectively the net heat received by the system and the net work done by the system during the change of state from 0 to 1. Differentiation gives:

$$dE=dQ-dW$$

Thermodynamics tells us nothing about the values of $E_1$ or $E_0$ in the previous equation though it does tell us the means of computing the difference between them. Since there is no absolute value of the internal energy, it is permissible to assume that its value to be zero at any specified state. 


It is profitable to reflect on the difference between the property $E$ and the non-properties $Q$ and $W$. A cyclic integral of $dQ$ or $dW$ may be other than zero, which is proof that the integrals of these quantities are not properties. On the other hand, the cyclic integral of $dE$ cannot be other than zero.

The differential $dE$ is an exact differential in terms of the variables that determine the state. The value of its integral is fixed when the values of the independent variables are fixed. Nos imilar statement can be made for $dQ$ and $dW$, because the values of their integrals depend on the processes by which the state is approached and not upon the magnitudes of the properties corresponding to the state. 

So we can write $E_1$ to denote the internal energy corresponding to a state 1 but not $W_1$ or $Q_1$, because there is no quantity of work or heat which corresponds to state 1.

#### Solution Code:
```python
## 5. Properties (Code Cell)
# The internal energy of a system remains unchanged if the system is isolated from its environment as regards work and heat, regardless of the nature of the changes within the system. 

# Internal energy remains unchanged for any cyclic change in the state of the system. This is equivalent to the First Law.
```
```python
## 6 Calculations (Code Cell)
### The definition of energy
# The term energy may be employed as a general term which embraces heat, work, and internal energy. 
# In Mechanics changes in internal energy of a system is called kinetic energy. 
# A system comprising a weight in a gravitational field, work may be introduced to raise the weight. The corresponding icnrease in the internal energy of the system is called in mechanics the increase in potential energy due to gravity. 
# Internal energy may include potential energy in an electrostatic field or in a magnetic field. These are all forms of stored energy which may be increased or decreased through the transfer of work alone. Internal energy includes besides these all kinds of stored energy which are affected by transfer of heat.
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning

The first law states that work and heat are equal in a cyclic process. Work and heat are evaluated at the boundaries of a system. No application of the first law can be made until the system and its boundaries are defined. The boundaries need not be stationary, and in general they will not be. 

*The first step in the solution of a problem in thermodynamics is the description of a system and its boundaries.*

## 1. Problem Statement
Air enters a compressor with a mass flow rate of 0.02 kg/s at 100 kPa and 290 K and exits the compressor at 600 kPa and 500 K. The compressor is cooled with 1 kJ/kg. 

**Goal**: 
* Determine the shaft power input.

---

## 2. Schematic
Draw a compressor with a control volume drawn around it. Indicate that power is transferred in from a shaft and heat is transferred out.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Control Volume** (mass crosses the boundary).
* **Ideal Gas Model** (Justification: Air at these conditions behaves as an ideal gas, $p v = R T$)
* **Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy** ($\Delta KE\approx0$, $\Delta PE\approx0$). (Justification: The velocities are typically low, or the change in height is negligible compared to the enthalpy change.)
* **Steady-flow process** ($\Delta~m_\text{CV}=0$, $\Delta~E_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta~S_\text{CV}=0$).
* **Properties**: Determine properties using `pyCalor`. 
* **Enthalpy/Internal Energy Change**: Changes in enthalpy can be determined via $dh = c_p dT$. (This is a consequence of the ideal gas model.)
* **Constant Specific Heats** ($c_p$, $c_v=\text{const}$). (Justification: The specific heat property changes are negligible over the process temperature range, simplifying the calculation of $\Delta h$ to $c_p~\Delta T$.
* We have a single inlet and outlet ($\dot{m}_\text{in}$ and $\dot{m}_\text{out}$).

---

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations
1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dE_\text{CV}}{dt}=\dot{E}_\text{in}-\dot{E}_\text{out}$$

2.  **Conservation of Mass (Mass Balance for a Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dm_\text{CV}}{dt}=\dot{m}_\text{in}-\dot{m}_\text{out}$$

Since this is a steady flow process, we can write:
$$\dot{E}_\text{in}=\dot{E}_\text{out}$$

$$\dot{m}_\text{in}=\dot{m}_\text{out}=\dot{m}$$

We can then write for a compressor:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{Q}_\text{in}+\dot{m}\left(h_1+\frac{w_1^2}{2}+gz_1\right)=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{Q}_\text{out}+\dot{m}\left(h_2+\frac{w_1^2}{2}+gz_2\right)$$

Neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{Q}_\text{in}+\dot{m}h_1=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{Q}_\text{out}+\dot{m}h_2$$

Since the compressor operates isentropically, we can assume that it is adiabatic:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{m}h_1=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{m}h_2$$

There is only work transferred into the compressor, not out. Therefore:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}=\dot{m}\left(h_2-h_1\right)$$

Assuming air behaves as an ideal gas, we can write:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}\approx\dot{m}c_p\left(T_2-T_1\right)$$

#### Solution Code:
```python

#For the properties, I am using the notation "in" and "out" as well as "1" and "2", where "in" is also "1" and "out" is also "2"

fluid = 'Air'

mdot_kgperS = 0.02 #kg/s

# state 1
P1_Pa = 100e3 #Pa
T1_K = 290 #K
st1 = th.state(fluid,T=(T1_K,'K'),p=(P1_Pa,'Pa'),name='1')
h1_JperKg = st1.h*1e3
cp_kJperKgPerK = st1.cp

# state 2
P2_Pa = 600e3 #Pa
T2_K = 500 #K
st2 = th.state(fluid,T=(T2_K,'K'),p=(P2_Pa,'Pa'),name='2')
h2_JperKg = st2.h*1e3

qout_JperKg = 1e3 #J/kg
```
```python
## 6 Calculations (Code Cell)
pr = th.process([(st1,st2)])
pr.plot('pv')
QdotOut_JperS = qout_JperKg*mdot_kgperS #J/s
WdotIn_JperS = QdotOut_JperS + mdot_kgperS*(h2_JperKg-h1_JperKg); print("WdotIn_JperS=",WdotIn_JperS) #J/s

### Alternative solution
WdotIn_JperS_alt = QdotOut_JperS + mdot_kgperS*(cp_kJperKgPerK*1e3)*(T2_K-T1_K); print("WdotIn_JperS_alt=",WdotIn_JperS_alt) #J/s
error = ((WdotIn_JperS - WdotIn_JperS_alt)/WdotIn_JperS)*100; print("error=",error)
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
We see that the ideal gas assumption is a good one since the error for determining the power input is less than 1% compared to using thermodynamic properties (pyCalor).

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
A piston cylinder contains 25 g of saturated water vapor at 300 kPa. The piston is kept at constant pressure while heat is transferred out. The cylinder contains a resistor inside of it while a voltage of 120 V is applied and 0.2 A of current passes through it for 5 min.

* **Heat transfer** Heat is transferred out

---

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations

Conservation of energy: 
$$\DeltaE_\text{CV}=E_\text{in}-E_\text{out}$$

$$\DeltaU+\DeltaKE+\DeltaPE=(W_\text{in}+Q_\text{in})-(W_\text{out}+Q_\text{out})$$

Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy:
$$\DeltaU=(W_\text{in})-(W_\text{out}+Q_\text{out})$$

$$W_\text{out}=p_1(V_2-V_1)$$

$$W_\text{out}=p_1m(v_2-v_1)$$

$$W_\text{in}=\text{V}I\Deltat$$

Combining yields:

$$m(u_2-u_1)=\text{V}I\Deltat-p_1m(v_2-v_1)-Q_\text{out}$$

Rearranging:

$$m\left[\left(u_2+p_1v_2\right)-\left(u_1+p_1v_1\right)\right]=\text{V}I\Deltat-Q_\text{out}$$

Since $p_2 = p_1$, we have:

$$m\left[\left(u_2+p_2v_2\right)-\left(u_1+p_1v_1\right)\right]=\text{V}I\Deltat-Q_\text{out}$$

The definition of enthalpy is:

$$h=u+pv$$

Therefore,

$$m\left[h_2-h_1\right]=\text{V}I\Deltat-Q_\text{out}$$

$$h_2=\text{V}I\Deltat/m-Q_\text{out}/m+h_1$$

We need to determine the specific volumes at state 2 and state 1.

#### Solution Code:
```python
## 5. Properties (Code Cell)

!pip install pyCalor
from pyCalor import thermo as th

# state 1
m_kg = 25/1000
p1_kPa = 300
x1 = 1

st1 = th.state('water', p = (p1_kPa,'kpa'), x = x1, name='1')

# state 2
p2_kPa = p1_kPa

# inputs
Qout_kJ = 3.7
I_A = 0.2
Volt_V = 120
dt_min = 5
```
```python
# 6 Calculations (Code Cell)
Win_e_J = I_A*Volt_V*(dt_min*60)
Win_e_kJ = Win_e_J/1e3; print(Win_e_kJ)

h2_J = (I_A*Volt_V*(dt_min*60)/m_kg) - (Qout_kJ*1e3) + st1.h*1e3
h2_kJ = h2_J/1000; print(h2_kJ)

# determine state 2 using h2
st2 = th.state('water', p = (p2_kPa,'kpa'), h = h2_kJ, name='2')

# by knowing state 2, we can determine T2
T2_K = st2.T
T2_C = T2_K - 273.15
print('T2: {0:1.2f} deg C'.format(T2_C))

# define the process using pyCalor
pr = th.process([(st1,st2)])

# plot the process on a pressure-specific volume diagram
pr.plot('pv');

# determine u2 + p2*v2 - (u1 + p1*v1)
h2 = st2.u + st2.v*st2.p
h1 = st1.u + st1.v*st1.p

answer = h2 - h1
print('u2 + p2*v2 - (u1 + p1*v1) = {0:1.2f} kJ/kg'.format(answer))

# st2.h - st1.h #kJ/kg
print('h2 - h1 = {0:1.2f} kJ/kg'.format(st2.h - st1.h))
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
We determined the temperature of the steam at state 2. We also compared $u_2 + p_2v_2 - (u_1 + p_1v_1)$ with $h_2 - h_1$ and found that they were the same.

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
Consider a closed system containing a fluid. The initial internal energy, $U_1$ is given. Shaft work is transferred in and heat is transferred out. 

**Goal** 
- Determine the final internal energy, $U_2$.

---

## 2. Schematic
Draw a rigid container that contains a paddle that can rotate. Draw a boundary around the inside of the container. The container should indicate that it is not insulated. Indicate that work is transferred in and heat is transferred out.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Closed system** (no mass in or out).

* **Work** is transferred in through shaft work.
* **Heat** is transferred out.

---

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations
Conservation of energy:

$$E_\text{in}-E_\text{out}=(Q_\text{in}-Q_\text{out})+(W_\text{in}-W_\text{out})$$

Neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy, we can write:

$$E_\text{in}-E_\text{out}=\DeltaE_\text{system}=U_2-U_1$$

Only work in and heat out:

$$U_2=U_1-Q_\text{out}+W_\text{in}$$

#### Solution Code:
```python
## 5. Properties (Code Cell)
Qout_kJ = 500

U1_kJ = 800
```
```python
# 6 Calculations (Code Cell)
U2_kJ = U1_kJ + (-Qout_kJ) - (-Win_kJ); print(U2_kJ)
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
From the first law of thermodynamics, since we are transferring more energy out than in, we would expect that the internal energy at state 2 is less than state 1.

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 7. 💡 Summary and Reasoning
Approximating changes in enthalpy with $c_p \Delta T$ was a good assumption for heating water. The rate of entropy generation was positive, even though the outside of the heat exchanger was well-insulated, since we were transferring heat from a hot fluid to a cold fluid.

**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 4: Energy Analysis of Closed Systems

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
A 50 kg iron block at a temperature of 80 deg C is immersed into a 0.5 m$^3$ water bath, which is initially at 25 deg C. 

**Goal**: 
* Determine the temperature when equilibrium is reached.

---

## 2. Schematic
Draw three control volumes. One control volume for the iron block (CV1); one control volume for the water bath (CV2); and one combined control volume consisting of CV1 and CV2.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Closed system** (no mass in or out).
* **No Work Transfer** There is no boundary work or other types of work being done.
* **Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy** ($\Delta KE\approx0$, $\Delta PE\approx0$). (Justification: The system is stationary, and there are no significant changes in elevation or velocity.)
* **Adiabatic Combined System** The combined control volume of the iron block and the water bath is assumed to be perfectly insulated. (Justification: No heat is transferred to or from the external surroundings, making $Q_\text{net,surroundings}=0$.)
* **Constant Specific Heats** ($c_p$, $c_v=\text{const}$). (Justification: The specific heat property changes are negligible over the process temperature range.
* **Thermal Equilibrium** The iron block and the water reach the same final temperature, $T_2$.

---

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations
- Conservation of energy.

$$\DeltaE_\text{CV1+CV2}=E_\text{in,CV1+CV2}-E_\text{out,CV1+CV2}$$

$$\left(\DeltaU+\DeltaKE+\DeltaPE\right)_\text{CV1+CV2}=(W_\text{in}+Q_\text{in})_\text{CV1+CV2}-(W_\text{out}+Q_\text{out})_\text{CV1+CV2}$$

No work or heat transfer:
$$\left(\DeltaU\right)_\text{CV1+CV2}=0$$

$$\DeltaU_\text{CV1}+\DeltaU_\text{CV2}=0\tag{1}$$

No heat will be transferred out of or into the combined control volumes of CV1 and CV2 (adiabatic).

### Change in internal energy of the iron block

For incompressible solids:

$$du=c_V(T)dT\text{(solids)}$$

$$\Deltau=\int_1^2c_V(T)dT\approxc_\text{V,avg}(T_2-T_\text{1,Fe})$$

We will select the value of $c_\text{V,Fe}$ at $T=T_\text{1,Fe}$, $c_\text{V,Fe}=c_\text{V,Fe}(T_\text{1,Fe})$. Substituting into equation (1):

$$\DeltaU_\text{CV1}=m_\text{Fe}c_\text{V,Fe}(T_2-T_\text{1,Fe})\tag{2}$$

### Conservation of energy of the water bath

For incompressible liquids, $c_p = c_V = c$, therefore:

$$du=c_V(T)dT$$

$$\Deltau=\int_1^2c_V(T)dT\approxc_\text{V,avg}(T_2-T_1)$$

We will select the value of $c_\text{H2O}$ at $T=T_\text{1,H2O}$, $c_\text{V,H2O}=c_\text{V,H2O}(T_\text{1,H2O})$. (We will see in the property tables that the only value for specific heat that is available is for room temperature. This should be okay since the initial and final temperature difference is not that large.) Substituting into equation (1):

$$\DeltaU_\text{CV2}=m_\text{H2O}c_\text{V,H2O}(T_2-T_\text{1,H2O})\tag{3}$$

Combining equations (1)-(3):

$$m_\text{Fe}c_\text{V,Fe}(T_2-T_\text{1,Fe})+m_\text{H2O}c_\text{V,H2O}(T_2-T_\text{1,H2O})=0$$

Rearranging:

$$T_2=\frac{m_\text{Fe}c_\text{V,Fe}T_\text{1,Fe}+m_\text{H2O}c_\text{V,H2O}T_\text{1,H2O}}{m_\text{Fe}c_\text{V,Fe}+m_\text{H2O}c_\text{V,H2O}}$$

When looking up property tables in the textbook, you will see that the only values that are available are $c_p$. Since the substances are incompressible, it is okay to substitute $c_p = c_V$ into the above equation.

### Alternative solution

You could analyze CV1 and CV2, and set the heat transferred out of the iron block to be equal to the heat transferred into the water bath. The combined control volumes would be treated as adiabatic with no work transfer.

#### Solution Code:
```python
## 5. Properties (Code Cell)
vH2O_m3PerKg = 0.001
VH2O_m3 = 0.5

mH2O_kg = VH2O_m3/vH2O_m3PerKg

mFe_kg = 50

T1H2O_C = 25
T1Fe_C = 80

cFe_kJperKgPerK = 0.45 # taken at room temperature
cH2O_kJperKgPerK = 4.18 # taken at 25 deg C
```
```python
# 6 Calculations (Code Cell)
T2_C = (mFe_kg*cFe_kJperKgPerK*T1Fe_C + mH2O_kg*cH2O_kJperKgPerK*T1H2O_C)/(mFe_kg*cFe_kJperKgPerK + mH2O_kg*cH2O_kJperKgPerK)
print(T2_C)
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
It makes sense that the final temperature, $T_2$, is between the initial iron and water temperature.

**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 3: Properties of Pure Substances

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
Instead of using the "tables" in the back of your textbook to determine thermodynamic properties, here we will use a Python module called [`pyCalor`](https://pypi.org/project/pyCalor/).

This Python module was developed in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. It is used for teaching undergraduate thermodynamics (ME40).

The software package contains classes `state` and `process`. The following is the description of their use. You can also get the built-in information by typing the following statements in the Python command line:  

`from pyCalor import thermo as th`

`print(th.state.__doc__)`   

`print(th.process.__doc__)`

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
**Goal**: Show that for an ideal gas in a closed system undergoing adiabatic expansion, that $ p V^\kappa = \text{const} $.

---

## 2. Schematic
Show a piston expanding some distance. The control volume should be drawn inside of the piston cylinder. No heat should be transferred in or out. Work should be shown to be transferred out.

* **Adiabatic process** ($Q_\text{in}=Q_\text{out}=0$). (Justification: The problem states it.)
* **Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy** ($\Delta KE\approx0$, $\Delta PE\approx0$). (Justification: The system is stationary, and there are no significant changes in elevation or velocity.)
* **Work transfer** Work is transferred only through boundary work ($p dV$).
* **Constant Specific Heats** ($c_p$, $c_v=\text{const}$). (Justification: The specific heat property changes are negligible over the process temperature range, simplifying the calculation of $\Delta h$ to $c_p~\Delta T$.

---

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations
* Conservation of energy
* Definition of specific heat and its relation to changes in internal energy

$$\DeltaE_\text{CV}=E_\text{in}-E_\text{out}$$

$$\DeltaU+\DeltaKE+\DeltaPE=(W_\text{in}+Q_\text{in})-(W_\text{out}+Q_\text{out})$$

$$\DeltaU=-W_\text{out}$$

$$\DeltaU=-W_\text{out}$$

We can write this in differential form:

$$dU=-\deltaW_\text{out}$$

$$dU=-pdV\tag{1}$$

Recall the definition of $c_V$:

$$c_V=\left(\frac{\partialu}{\partialT}\right)_V$$

That is, if we transfer heat to a control volume, and if the volume is kept constant, then changes in internal energy can be related to changes in temperature through a constant. 

$$\impliesdu=c_VdT\tag{2}$$

Combining equations (1) and (2), and including the mass of the gas in the piston, $m$, we have:

$$mdu=mc_VdT=-pdV\tag{3}$$

We would like to replace temperature with $p$ and $V$. For this we can use the ideal gas law:

$$pV=mRT\tag{4}$$

Taking the differential:

$$d\left(pV\right)=mRdT$$

$$Vdp+pdV=mRdT$$

Rearranging:

$$dT=\frac{Vdp+pdV}{mR}\tag{5}$$

Combining equations (5) and (3), we have:

$$mc_V\left(\frac{Vdp+pdV}{mR}\right)=-pdV$$

Simplifying:

$$c_V\left(Vdp+pdV\right)=-RpdV$$

$$c_VVdp+c_VpdV+RpdV=0$$

$$(c_V+R)pdV+c_VVdp=0$$

$$\frac{(c_V+R)}{c_V}\frac{dV}{V}+\frac{dp}{p}=0$$

$$\frac{(c_V+R)}{c_V}\int\frac{dV}{V}+\int\frac{dp}{p}=0$$

$$\frac{(c_V+R)}{c_V}\lnV+\lnp=\text{const}$$

Assuming constant specific heats, we can define a constant:

$$\kappa\equiv\frac{(c_V+R)}{c_V}\tag{7}$$

$$\kappa\lnV+\lnp=\text{const}$$

$$\lnV^\kappa+\lnp=\text{const}$$

$$\lnpV^\kappa=\text{const}$$

$$pV^\kappa=\text{const}\tag{8}$$

# Define the initial and final volumes for the processes
V_initial = 1.0  # Initial volume in m^3
V_final = 5.0    # Final volume in m^3
# Define initial temperature

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
We were able to prove that $p V^{\kappa} = \text{constant}$ for an adiabatic expansion process. We also see from this that we are able to relate pressure to volume for a process from A to B. That means we will be able to determine the boundary work done for such a process. This will be useful when we start to analyze cycles, such as the Carnot cycle, which has adiabatic expansion and compression processes.

### PROBLEM: Differential Entropy Relations
**Source:** Jupyter Notebook (entropyDifferentialRelations.ipynb)
**Topic:** Entropy
**Lecture References:** Key: Fa25-L7c-4.0 (Differential entropy change relations)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 7: Entropy

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement

Derive the differential entropy change relations.  

**Goal:** For an ideal gas, show that for an isentropic process, we can relate temperature, pressure, and specific volume between two states by knowing specific heats.

---

## 2. Schematic 

We can choose to analyze a piston-cylinder device that can perform boundary work.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Internally reversible process** $\left( \frac{\delta Q}{T} \right)_\text{int,rev}=dS$. An internally reversible process is one where all irreversibilities, e.g., friction, temperature differences, etc., occur outside the system's boundaries. Inside the system, the process occurs without any dissipation, maintaining equilibrium and a uniform temperature.
* **Work** The only kind of work a simple compressible system may undergo in an internally reversible process is boundary work.
* **Constant Specific Heats** ($c_p$, $c_v=\text{const}$). (Justification: The specific heat property changes are negligible over the process temperature range, simplifying the calculation of $\Delta~h$ to $c_p~\Delta~T$.

---

## 4. Physical Laws
1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Closed System):**
    $$dU=\deltaQ_\text{int,rev}-\deltaW_\text{int,rev}$$

We can write this as:

$$dU=TdS-pdV$$

$$\impliesTdS=dU+pdV$$

We call this the $TdS$ or Gibbs equation. We can also write this as:
$$Tds=du+pdv$$

Recalling the definition of enthalpy $h = u + pv$, we can write it in differential form:

$$dh=du+pdv+vdp$$

or 

$$du=dh-pdv-vdp$$

Substituting into the $Tds$ equation:

$$Tds=\left(dh-pdv-vdp\right)+pdv$$

Simplifying:

$$Tds=dh-vdp$$

So changes in entropy can be related to other properties:

$$ds=\frac{dh}{T}-\frac{vdp}{T}\tag{1}$$

For an ideal gas we can recall that $dh = c_p dT$ and $p v = R T$. We can write the ideal gas equation as:

$$v=RT/p$$

Substituting that and $dh = c_p dT$ into equation (1):

$$ds=\frac{c_pdT}{T}-\frac{(RT/p)dp}{T}$$

Simplifying:

$$ds=\frac{c_pdT}{T}-\frac{Rdp}{p}$$

Integrating from state 1 to state 2:

$$\int_1^2ds=\int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{c_pdT}{T}-R\int_{p_1}^{p_2}\frac{dp}{p}$$

Assuming constant specific heats:

$$\int_1^2ds=c_p\int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{dT}{T}-R\int_{p_1}^{p_2}\frac{dp}{p}$$

Then we have:

$$s_2-s_1=c_p\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}-R\ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}\tag{2}$$

For an ideal gas we can recall that $du = c_v dT$ and $p = R T / v$. Substituting yields:

$$Tds=\left(c_vdT\right)+\left(RT/v\right)dv$$

Rearranging:
$$ds=\left(\frac{c_vdT}{T}\right)+\left(\frac{R}{v}\right)dv$$

Integrating:
$$\int_1^2ds=\int_1^2\frac{c_vdT}{T}+\int_1^2\frac{R}{v}dv$$

Assuming constant specific heats:
$$s_2-s_1=c_v\int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{dT}{T}+R\int_{v_1}^{v_2}\frac{dv}{v}$$

$$s_2-s_1=c_v\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}+R\ln\frac{v_2}{v_1}\tag{3}$$

If isentropic and constant specific heats, we can write equation (2) and (3) as:       

$$0=c_p\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}-R\ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}$$
             
$$0=c_v\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}+R\ln\frac{v_2}{v_1}$$

We can rearrange these as:

$$\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\ln\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{R}{c_p}}$$
             
$$\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\ln\left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\frac{R}{c_v}}$$

Simplifying:

$$\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{R}{c_p}}$$
             
$$\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\frac{R}{c_v}}$$

Recalling that $k = c_p/c_v$ and $R = c_p - c_v$, we can write:

$$\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{c_p-c_v}{c_p}}$$
             
$$\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\frac{c_p-c_v}{c_v}}$$

Rearranging:

$$\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{[k/k-(1/k)]}=\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{(k-1)/k}\tag{idealgas,s=const}$$
             
$$\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\left(\frac{v_1}{v_2}\right)^{k-1}\tag{idealgas,s=const}$$

We can set these two equations equal to each other to get our third isentropic relation:

$$\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{(k-1)/k}=\left(\frac{v_1}{v_2}\right)^{k-1}$$

Which we can re-write as:

$$\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)=\left(\frac{v_1}{v_2}\right)^{k}\tag{idealgas,s=const}$$

We can write these three ideal gas isentropic relations more generally as:

$$Tv^{k-1}=\text{const}$$
$$Tp^{(1-k)/k}=\text{const}$$
$$pv^k=\text{const}$$

where $k = k(T)$.

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
With the $Tds$ relations we can relate changes in entropy to changes in measurable properties like pressure, temperature, and specific volume for an ideal gas. That can be quite useful for computing entropy changes in a process involving an ideal gas. It is also useful for analyzing isentropic processes involving an ideal gas, such as a turbine or compressor. This will be important when analyzing **Gas Power Cycles**.

### PROBLEM: entropyIdealGasExpansion
**Source:** Jupyter Notebook (entropyIdealGasExpansion.ipynb)
**Topic:** Properties
**Lecture References:** 
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 7: Entropy

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
A rigid container contains 1 kg of air initially at 1 bar, which is connected to another evacuated rigid container ov volume 1 m$^3$ with a valve. The entire system is kept in contact with a thermal reservoir at 300 K. Now the valve is opened.

**Goal:** Determine the change in entropy of the air.

---

## 2. Schematic 
Draw a schematic that shows one container connected to another. Indicate that the temperature is kept constant. Draw a boundary around the left container and indicate state 1. Draw an expanded boundary that includes both containers and call that state 2. No mass in or out.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Closed system** (no mass in or out).
* **Ideal Gas Model** (Justification: Air at these conditions behaves as an ideal gas, $p v = R T$)
* **Tds Relations** Because the substance is an ideal gas, we can use $Tds$ relations to compute changes in entropy if we assume constant specific heats.
* **Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy**: $\Delta KE\approx0$, $\Delta PE\approx0$. (Justification: The velocities are typically low, or the change in height is negligible compared to the enthalpy change.)
* **Pure Substance** We can use pyCalor to determine properties such as specific entropy

---

## 4. Physical Laws
Since we are determining the change in entropy of the gas from state 1 to state 2, we can simply determine the specific entropy at state 2 and state 2. The change in entropy is then:

$$\DeltaS=S_2-S_1=m(s_2-s_1)$$

We know state 1, but we need to determine state 2. We know that $p_1 =$101,325 Pa. For state 2, we need the pressure, $p_2$, which we can determine it from the ideal gas equation:

$$p_2=mRT_2/V_2$$

We know that $V_2$ is equal to the volume of both containers, $V_2 = V_I + V_{II}$. We can determine the volume of container 1 as:

$$V_1=mRT_1/p_1$$

where $V_I = V_1$

The volume at state 2 is then:
$$V_2=(mRT_1/p_1)+V_{II}$$

The pressure is then:

$$p_2=mRT_2/V_2$$

With the pressure and the temperature at state 2, we have complete information since it's a pure substance, so we can use `pyCalor` to determine its specific entropy.

** Alternative solution **
Alternatively, we can relate changes in properties to changes in entropy through the $Tds$ relation:

$$Tds=du+pdv$$

Assuming an ideal gas:

$$Tds=c_vdT+pdv$$

Assuming constant specific heats, we can write:

$$s_2-s_1=c_p\ln\frac{T_2}{T_2}-R\ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}$$

Since it's an isothermal process:

$$s_2-s_1=-R\ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}$$

#### Solution Code:
```python
## 5. Properties (Code Cell)

m_kg = 1

V_II = 1
V2 = V1+V_II; print("V2 =",V2,"m3")

# state 2
T2_K = T1_K
p2_Pa = R_JperKgPerK*m_kg*T2_K/V2; print("p2 =",p2_Pa,"Pa")
```
```python

st1 = th.state('air',T=T1_K,p=p1_Pa/1000)
s1 = st1.s #kJ/kg/K
print("s1 =",s1,"kJ/kg/K")

st2 = th.state('air',T=T2_K,p=p2_Pa/1000)
s2 = st2.s # kJ/kg/K
print("s2 =",s2,"kJ/kg/K")

DeltaS_kJperK = (s2 - s1)*m_kg; print("DeltaS_kJperK",DeltaS_kJperK,"kJ/K")

# **Alternative Solution**
import numpy as np
DeltaS_kJperK_alt = - R_JperKgPerK*np.log(p2_Pa/p1_Pa)/1000
print("DeltaS_kJperK_alt",DeltaS_kJperK_alt,"kJ/K")
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
Because the gas expansion is a spontaneous process, we could infer that the entropy should increase. Since it is an isothermal process, and since the specific volume is increasing, we would expect from the ideal gas law that the pressure should decrease. 

* **Key Insight:** From the $Tds$ relations, we know that for an isothermal process, decreasing pressure will cause an increase in entropy. Alternatively stated, for an isothermal process, increasing specific volume will increase entropy.

### PROBLEM: Isentropic nitrogen compressor
**Source:** Jupyter Notebook (compressorAdiabaticNitrogen.ipynb)
**Topic:** Entropy
**Lecture References:** Lecture ID: 1_4ak8fp37, Key: Fa25-L7c-5.0 (Air property tables: Compressor example)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 7: Entropy

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
Nitrogen enters an adiabatic compressor at $p_1 =$ 110 kPa and $T_1 =$ 30 $^\circ$ C and exits at $p_2 =$ 682 kPa. The process is reversible. 

**Goal:** Determine the work input per unit mass, $\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}}$.

---

## 2. Schematic 

Draw a schematic that shows a compressor. Draw the control volume around the compressor. There is a single inlet and oulet for mass to flow in and out. Indicate that it is adiabatic and that work is being transferred in.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Control Volume** (mass crosses the boundary).
* **Properties** We can use pyCalor to determine properties. 
* **Ideal Gas Model** (Justification: Nitrogen at these conditions behaves as an ideal gas, $p v = R T$)
* **Tds Relations** Because the substance is an ideal gas, we can use $Tds$ relations to compute changes in entropy if we assume constant specific heats.
* Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy ($\Delta KE\approx0$, $\Delta PE\approx0$). (Justification: The velocities are typically low, or the change in height is negligible compared to the enthalpy change.)
* **Reversible process** (Justification: The problem states it.)
* **Adiabatic process** (Justification: The problem states it.)
* **Steady-flow process** ($\Delta m_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta E_\text{CV}= 0$, $\Delta S_\text{CV}= 0$).
* We have a single inlet and outlet ($\dot{m}_\text{in}$ and $\dot{m}_\text{out}$).

---

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations
1.  **First Law of Thermodynamics (Energy Balance for Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dE_\text{CV}}{dt}=\dot{E}_\text{in}-\dot{E}_\text{out}$$

2.  **Conservation of Mass (Mass Balance for a Control Volume):**
    $$\frac{dm_\text{CV}}{dt}=\dot{m}_\text{in}-\dot{m}_\text{out}$$

Since this is a steady flow process, we can write:
$$\dot{E}_\text{in}=\dot{E}_\text{out}$$

$$\dot{m}_\text{in}=\dot{m}_\text{out}=\dot{m}$$

We can then write for a compressor:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{Q}_\text{in}+\dot{m}\left(h_1+\frac{w_1^2}{2}+g~z_1\right)=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{Q}_\text{out}+\dot{m}\left(h_2+\frac{w_1^2}{2}+g~z_2\right)$$

Neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{Q}_\text{in}+\dot{m}h_1=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{Q}_\text{out}+\dot{m}h_2$$

Since the compressor operates isentropically, we can assume that it is adiabatic:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}+\dot{m}h_1=\dot{W}_\text{out}+\dot{m}h_2$$

There is only work transferred into the compressor, not out. Therefore:
$$\dot{W}_\text{in}=\dot{m}\left(h_2-h_1\right)$$

We can then write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}}=h_2-h_1$$

We know $h_1$ because we have the properties at state 1. We need additional information in order to determine state 2. Since the compressor is reversible and adiabatic (no heat transfer in), then the process is isentropic. Therefore:

$$s_2=s_1$$

We can use this information to determine the enthalpy at state 2. 

### Alternative solution

We can determine the temperature at state 2 by using the $TdS$ relations. For an ideal gas undergoing an isentropic (reversible and adiabatic) process, we can write:

$$\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)_{s=const}=\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{(k-1)/k}$$

Recall that $k=c_p/c_v$, so to do this calculation we have to select the $k$ at some temperature. We can choose the temperature at the inlet state. By knowing $T_1$, $p_1$, and $p_2$, we can determine $T_2$. 

For an ideal gas, changes in enthalpy can be expressed as:

$$h_2-h_1=c_p\left(T_2-T_1\right)$$

Again, we have to select a specific heat at some temperature. We can take the inlet temperature.

#### Solution Code:
```python

# Constants and Initial State
p1_kPa = 110 # kPa
T1_C = 30 # C

substance = 'nitrogen'

# Determine state 1
st1 = th.state(substance,T=(T1_C,'C'),p=(p1_kPa,'kPa'),name='1')
s1_kJperKgPerK = st1.s
h1_kJperKg = st1.h
cp_kJperKgPerK = st1.cp
cv_kJperKgPerK = st1.cv
k = cp_kJperKgPerK/cv_kJperKgPerK

# Determine state 2
s2_kJperKgPerK = s1_kJperKgPerK
st2 = th.state(substance,s=(s2_kJperKgPerK,'kJ/kg K'),p=(p2_kPa,'kPa'),name='2')
h2_kJperKg = st2.h

## Alternative solution
T2_K_alt = T1_K*(p2_kPa/p1_kPa)**((k-1)/k)
```
```python
# 6 Calculations (Code Cell)
wIn_kJperKg = h2_kJperKg - h1_kJperKg

print(f"Work input per unit mass: {wIn_kJperKg:.2f} kJ/kg")

wIn_kJperKg_alt = cp_kJperKgPerK*(T2_K_alt - T1_K)

print(f"Work input per unit mass assuming ideal gas and using TdS relations: {wIn_kJperKg_alt:.2f} kJ/kg")
```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning

By separating flow work from total work to form the property enthalpy, the work term we calculate is then useful shaft work. The work out per unit mass is a simple formula: 

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}}=h_2-h_1$$

* **Key Insight:** For a steady flow system undergoing an **adiabatic** and **reversible** process, this can be considered as an isentropic process. That is useful because it allows us to determine the exit state of the turbine since we also know the exit pressure. 

* **Alternative Solution** If we assume ideal gas behavior, and if the process is isentropic (reversible and adiabatic) then we can write:

$$\frac{\dot{W}_\text{in}}{\dot{m}}=c_p\left(T_2-T_1\right)$$

For that we have to select specific heats at a certain temperature. We chose the inlet temperature. That turned out to be a good assumption. This approach is simpler and is a good way to first solve the problem. One can check if it is a good assumption by determining actual property values using `pyCalor`.

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
Calculate the heat transfer, in kJ/kg, for the reversible steady-flow process from states 1 to 2 to 3 given the following information: 

State 1 is $T_1 = 120^\circ$C and $s_1$=0.01 kJ/(kg K). The temperature decreases linearly as a function of specific entropy to state 2. State 2 is at $T_2 = 30^\circ$C and $s_1$=1.0 kJ/(kg K). The process from state 2 to 3 is isentropic with $T_3= 100^\circ$C.

---

## 2. Schematic
No schematic needed. Analyze the temperature-specific entropy diagram.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Internally reversible process** $\left( \frac{\delta Q}{T} \right)_\text{int,rev}=dS$. An internally reversible process is one where all irreversibilities, e.g., friction, temperature differences, etc., occur outside the system's boundaries.

---

## 4. Physical Laws and Governing Equations
$$dS=\left(\frac{\deltaQ}{T}\right)_\text{intrev}$$

The integral of $\frac{\delta Q}{T}$ gives us the value of entropy change if the integration is carried out along an internally reversible path between the two states. The integral of$\frac{\delta Q}{T}$ along an irreversible path is not a property, and different values will be obtained if one integrates along different irreversible paths.

# Draw this process on a T-s diagram

```

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
We expected the sign of $q$ to be positive since entropy was increasing from states 1 to 2. We did not expect any heat addition from states 2 to 3 because there was no change in entropy.

### PROBLEM: The Pure Substance
**Source:** Jupyter Notebook (propertiesIndependentDependent.ipynb)
**Topic:** Properties
**Lecture References:** Lecture ID: 1_r5zqwxag, Key: Fa25-L1b-5.0 (Independent and Dependent Properties)
**Book Reference:** Book Ch. 3: Properties of Pure Substances

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
Any change in the property $P$ may be expressed in terms of its partial derivatives and the changes in the independent properties; thus:

$$dP=\frac{\partialP}{\partialx_1}dx_1+\frac{\partialP}{\partialx_2}dx_2+...\frac{\partialP}{\partialx_n}dx_n$$

Consider a system having two independent properties, $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then the differential of the dependent property $P$ is given by:

$$dP=\frac{\partialP}{\partialx_1}dx_1+\frac{\partialP}{\partialx_2}dx_2$$

Partial-differential calculus teaches that if $P$ is a function of $x_1$ and $x_2$ then the magnitude of the second derivative of $P$ with respect to $x_1$ and $x_2$ is independent of the order of differentation:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partialx_2}\left(\frac{\partialP}{\partialx_1}\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partialx_1}\left(\frac{\partialP}{\partialx_2}\right)$$

If we have an expression of the form:

$$dP=Mdx_1+Ndx_2$$

Then

$$\frac{\partialM}{\partialx_2}=\frac{\partialN}{\partialx_1}$$

provided that $P$ is a property of the system. This is another way that a property may be identified.

## The Pure Substance

A system which is homogeneous in composition and homogeneous and invariable in chemical aggregation is called a pure substance. For example, a system consisting of pure oxygen existing as a vapor, a liquid, a solid, or any combination of these is a pure substance. 

The same can be said as regard ordinary water. Air may be consideered a pure substance as long as it is all vapor or all liquid. However, if part is a liquid and part vapor, then it is no longer a pure substance, for the liquid will be richer in nitrogen than the vapor. Again, a mixture of one mole of hydrogen gas and one-half mole of oxygen gas is a pure substance as long as no liquid or solid phase appears. On the other hand, if one part of the system the constituents are combined chemically in the form H2O, the system is not a pure substance because though homogeneous in composition it is not homogeneous in chemical aggregation. If the entire system changes in the course of a process to form H2O, it would not be considered a pure substance during that process because it is not invariable in chemical aggregation. 

_It is known from experience that a pure substance in the absence of motion, gravity, capillarity, electricity, and magnetism has only two independent properties._ Among the familiar properties of a pure substance which can be quantitatively evaluated are pressure, temperature, specific volume, internal energy, viscosity, and electrical resistivity. Among these we may select two, and if these two prove to be independent of each other, then when their values are fixed the values of all the others are fixed. Most of the time, any two properties will be indepedent of each other. Exceptions are specific volume and density. A less obvious exception is the combination of pressure and temperature — these properties are independent of each other for pure substances in the vapor phase or in the liquid phase, but not for a mixture of phases.

## The symbols $e$, $u$, $E$, and $U$

A system consisting of a pure substance in a homogeneous and stable state has two independent properties in the absence of motion, gravity, electricity, magnetism, and capillarity. Therefore, we may state that the internal energy of a 1-kg mass of such a system is a fucntion, for example, of temperature and volume of the unit mass. To this function we shall give the symbol $u$, whereas the symbol $e$ may be used to denote the internal energy of a unit system in general. Thsu, for the conditions specified, we may write:

$$e=u(T,v)$$

or simply

$$e=u$$

Values of the function $u$ may be arranged in a table according to values of two arguments, such as temperature and specific volume, or temperature and pressure. Values of $e$ could not be arranged in such a sinmple table because $e$ changes not only with changes in temperature and specific volume, but also with changes in motion, height, electrostatic charge, position in an electrostatic field, etc. Therefore, we distinguish between $u$, the function of two variables, and $e$, the function of many variables. We will use the capital letters $U$ and $E$ to denote the corresponding quantities for systems that are not of a unit mass. Thus, 

$$U=\intudm\text{and}E=\intedm$$

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## 1. Problem Statement
A piston compresses a gas inside of a piston-cylinder device. Consider three different processes: isothermal, isobaric, and adiabatic. Create a plot of pressure vs. volume for these three different compression processes.

---

## 2. Schematic
Draw a piston-cylinder device with a boundary inside of it. Indicate that work is being transferred into the system. For the isothermal and isobaric processes indicate that heat is being transferred out. For the adiabatic case indicate that there is no heat transfer in or out.

---

## 3. Assumptions and Approximations
* **Ideal Gas Model** (Justification: Air at these conditions behaves as an ideal gas, $p v = R T$)
* **Quasi-equilibrium process** This is a necessary assumption if we are going to relate changes in properties to path functions like work, $W$.
* **Neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy**: $\Delta KE\approx0$, $\Delta PE\approx0$. (Justification: The velocities are typically low, or the change in height is negligible compared to the enthalpy change.)
* **Boundary work** is transferred through expansion ($p dV$).
* **Closed system** (no mass in or out).
* **Constant Specific Heats** ($c_p$, $c_v=\text{const}$). (Justification: The specific heat property changes are negligible over the process temperature range, simplifying the calculation of $\Delta~h$ to $c_p~\Delta~T$.

## 3. Physical Laws and Governing Equations

### Process: Compress Gas

Reversible process:

Consider a piston whose piston head area is, $S$. The piston head is displaced, compressing the gas inside of it. That gas inside is at a pressure, $p$. 

The force applied to the piston head is:

$$F=pS$$

If we shift the piston a distance, $dh$, an amount of work $dW$ is done:

$$dW=pSdh$$

$$W=\int_A^B~pdV$$

Let's analyze the isothermal compression of an ideal gas in a piston. 

$$dU=\delta~Q-\delta~W$$

$$W=\int_A^B~pdV$$

We know from the ideal gas law that:

$$pV=mRT$$

which we can re-write as:

$$p=\frac{mRT}{V}$$

Therefore, we have:

$$W=\int_A^B~\frac{mRT}{V}dV$$

Since $T$ is constant and it is a closed system (no mass transfer), we have:

$$W=mRT~\int_A^B~\frac{1}{V}dV$$

$$W=mRT~\ln~\frac{V_A}{V_B}$$

#### Final Summary / Reasoning:
## 7. Summary and Reasoning
If the state of the system can be represented on a $(p,V)$ diagram, the work performed during a transformation has a simple geometric representation. 

Transformations which are especially important are those for which the initial and final states are the same. these are called cyclical transformations or cycles. A cycle, therefore is a transformation which brings the system back to its initial state. If the state of the system can be represented on a volume pressure diagram then a cycle can be represented on this diagram by a closed curve, such as the curve, 1234.

#### Problem Statement and Analysis:
## Reasoning
### For the isothermal expansion
We see that as the volume increases, the pressure decreases as $1/V$, which is what we would expect from the ideal gas law. We also see from this that we are able to relate pressure to volume for this process. That means we will be able to determine the boundary work done for such a process. This will be useful when we start to analyze cycles, such as the Carnot cycle, which has isothermal expansion and compression processes. We also see that the boundary work done in expansion is positive, which is what we expected. 

### For the isobaric expansion
We see that the work transferred out for the isobaric expansion process is larger than the isothermal, which is what we would expect since the area under the pressure-volume curve is higher for the isobaric vs. the isothermal.
